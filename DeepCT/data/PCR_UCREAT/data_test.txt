persons was not free from blemish in so far as it appeared from the evidence that the first person who originated the theory of the complicity of the accused in that case was almost a blind person who could not see things particularly at the dead of the night and that the other witnesses who turned up at the alarm had readily accepted the opinion of the first witness that it was the condemned person who had been responsible for the murderous assault each case has its own peculiar facts and it is therefore always risky to appeal to precedents on questions of fact in the present case < org > differentiated the case of the two appellants from that of the other two accused whom it acquitted chiefly on the ground that whereas there was some evidence of motive against the two appellants there was no such evidence against those two acquitted persons on the question of motive the trial court held that it had not been established that the deceased < name > had given information to the police

within a few feet of the two eye witnesses if the witnesses had said i know there were five assailants and i am certain of a and i am not certain of the other two but think they were and a conviction of a and provided the witnesses are believed would be proper but when the witnesses are in no doubt either about the number or the identity and there is no suggestion about mistaken identity and when further the circumstances shut out any reasonable possibility of that then hesitation on the part of the judge can only be ascribed not to any doubt about identity but to doubt about the number taking part it is true when feelings run high and there is personal cause for enmity that there is a tendency to drag in an innocent person against whom a witness has a grudge along with the guilty but foundation must be laid for such a criticism and the mere fact of relationship far from being a foundation is often a sure guarantee of truth there is no such general rule now what is the ground for

corroborative element of the blood stained clothes is to be found it would be as unsafe to believe on the strength of their testimony that at least five persons were present as it would be to accept

the uttar pradesh coal control order purporting to act in exercise of the powers conferred upon it by section of the essential supplies act read with the notified order of < org > issued under section of the act in this order unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context < org > means", "the district magistrate of the district or any other officer authorised by him to perform his functions under this order and includes the district supply officer of the district no person shall stock sell store for sale or utilise coal for burning bricks or shall otherwise dispose of coal in this state except under a licence in form a or granted under this order or in accordance with the provisions of this order the state coal controller may by written order likewise require any person holding stock of coal to sell the whole or any part of the stock to such person or class of persons and on such terms and prices as may be determined in accordance with the provisions of clause no licensee in form and no person acting on his behalf shall sell agree to sell or offer for sale coal at a price exceeding the price to be declared by < org > in accordance with the formula given in schedule iii a licensee in form a or any other person holding stock of coal or any other person acting for or on behalf of such licensees or person transferring or disposing of such stocks to any person in accordance with clause or clause shall not charge for the coal a price exceeding the landed cost plus incidental and handling charges plus an amount not exceeding per cent of the landed cost as may be determined by < org > or the state coal controller the district magistrate shall within a week of the commencement of this order prepare and publish in a local paper a list of persons carrying on the business of sale of coal in his district and upon the publication of the list the persons included therein will be deemed for purposes of this order to be licensee until three months next following the publication of the list in form a or as may be specified if any person contravenes any of the provisions of this order or the conditions of licenee granted thereunder he shall be punishable under section of the essential supplies temporary powers act with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years or with fine or with both and without prejudice to any other punishment to which he may be liable in accordance with the provision of clause of the control order set out above the petitioners name appeared in the list of licence holders and they did apply for a licence in the proper form as required by clause the charges mainly were that there were two other depots held and financed by the petitioners themselves in the names of different persons and that the petitioners had entered into agreements for sale of coal at more than the fixed rates in the present petition the petitioners have challenged the validity of the coal control order of the th of july the declaration of prices made on the th of july", "following and also the order cancelling the petitioners licence on the th of october it is argued that these provisions imposing as they do unreasonable restrictions upon the right of the petitioners to carry on their trade and business conflict with their fundamental rights under article of the constitution and are hence void all that is necessary is that these provisions should not infringe the fundamental rights of the citizens guaranteed under part iii of the constitution and if they impose restrictions upon the carrying on of trade or business they must be reasonable restrictions imposed in the interests of the general public as laid down in article of the constitution the power of granting or withholding licences or of fixing the prices of the goods would necessarily have to be vested in certain public officers or bodies and they would certainly have to be left with some amount of discretion in these matters so far no exception can be taken but the mischief arises when the power conferred on such officers is an arbitrary power unregulated by any rule or principle and it is left entirely to the discretion of particular persons to do anything they like without any check or control by any higher authority a law or order which confers arbitrary and uncontrolled power upon the executive in the matter of regulating trade or business in normally available commodities cannot but be held to be unreasonable legislation which arbitrarily or excessively invades the right cannot be said to contain the quality of reasonableness and unless it strikes a proper balance between the freedom guaranteed under it is in the light of these principles that we would proceed to examine the provisions of this control order the validity of which has been impugned before us on behalf of the petitioners there are two exceptions engrafted upon this general rule the first is laid down in sub clause a and to that no objection has been or can be taken the second exception which is embodied in subclause has been objected to by the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners this exception provides that nothing in clause shall apply to any person or class of persons exempted from any provision of the above sub clause by the state coal controller to the extent of such exemption an unrestricted power has been given to the state controller to make exemptions and even if he acts arbitrarily or from improper motives there is no check over it and no way of obtaining redress we agree however with mr < name > that this portion of the control order even though bad is severable from the rest and we are not really concerned with the validity or otherwise of this provision in the present case as no action taken under it is the subject matter of any complaint before us the more formidable objection has been taken on behalf of the petitioners against clause of the", "control order which relates to the granting and refusing of licences the licensing authority has been given absolute power to grant or refuse to grant renew or refuse to renew suspend revoke cancel or modify any licenee under this order and the only thing he has to do is to record reasons for the action he takes not only so the power could be exercised by any person to whom the state coal controller may choose to delegate the same and the choice can be made in favour of any and every person practically the order commits to the unrestrained will of a single individual the power to grant withhold or cancel licences in any way he chooses and there is nothing in the order which could ensure a proper execution of the power or operate as a check upon injustice that might result from improper execution of the same this safeguard in our opinion is hardly effective for there is no higher authority prescribed in the order who could examine the propriety of these reasons and revise or review the decision of the subordinate officer it was pointed out and with perfect propriety by mr justice < name > in the well known american case of < name > hopkins that the action or non action of officers placed in such position may proceed from emmity or prejudice from partisan zeal or animosity from favouritism and other improper influences and motives which are easy of concealment and difficult to be detected and exposed and consequently the injustice capable of being wrought under cover of such unrestricted power becomes apparent to every man without the necessity of detailed investigation as this provision forms an integral part of the entire structure of the uttar pradesh coal control order the order cannot operate properly unless the provision of clause is brought in conformity with the constitutional requirements indicated above clause empowers the state coal controller to direct by written order any person holding stock of coal to sell the whole or any part of the stock to such person or class of persons and on such terms and prices as may be determined in accordance with the provision of clause clause provides that no licensee in form shall sell or agree to sell coal at a price exceeding the price to be declared by the licensing authority in accordance with the formula given in schedule iii with regard to items and of the schedule the actual costs are taken into account and to that no objection can possibly be taken the discretion given to the licensing authority in fixing these rates is however not an unlimited discretion but has got to be exercised with reference to the condition prevalent in the locality with which the local officers must be presumed to be familiar it is pointed out that at lucknow ali", "##garh allahabad and other places much higher rates were allowed though the local conditions of these places are almost identical and there has been consequently a discrimination in this respect which makes the declaration void altogether it is certainly not open to us to substitute our own determination in tile matter of fixing the prices for that of the licensing authority and provided we are satisfied that the discretion that has been vested in a public officer is not an uncontrolled discretion and no unfair discrimination has resulted from the exercise of it we cannot possibly strike down as illegal any order or declaration made by such officer schedule iii fixes the profit at per cent upon the landed costs with the exception of item no and as this is not the maximum it would have to be allowed in all cases and under clause the licensees are to sell their stocks of coal according to the prices fixed under schedule iii we make no order as to costs [SEP]"]}

deemed to be subject the general principle is that time does not run against a minor and the circumstance that he has been represented by a guardian does not affect the question the learned judge of

by his next friend the application has been dismissed by the lower < org > on the ground that it is barred by limitation under section of the code of civil procedure it having been presented more than twelve years after the date of the decree although within three years after the attainment of majority by the plaintiff the first question for consideration is whether the plaintiff is entitled to the benefit of section of the limitation act and to reckon the period of limitation for execution of the decree from the date of attainment of majority and whether apart from that section there is any general principle of law entitling him to the same benefit on account of his disability arising from minority article of the limitation act which lays down the general rule of limitation applicable to execution of decrees exempts from its operation cases coming within the purview of section of the civil procedure code section of the act enacts that where a person entitled to institute a suit or make an application for the execution of a decree is at the time from which the period of limitation is to be reckoned a minor he may institute the suit or make the application within the same period after the disability has ceased as would otherwise have been allowed from the time prescribed therefor in the third column of the first schedule and as article of the schedule is inapplicable to the

judgment but the question really does not admit of any serious doubt on the language of the section it is unnecessary to consider whether the other general provisions of the limitation act contained in sections to would be applicable or not where the period of limitation is prescribed by some special act and not by the general code of limitation it is strenuously contended by mr < name > the

contention mainly on < name > < name > i bom < name > < name > observed the question referred to us must be decided by the general principle of law as to the disability of minors to which the provisions of the civil procedure code must in the absence of anything to the contrary be deemed to be subject the general principle", "is that time does not run against a minor and the circumstance that he has been represented by a guardian does not affect the question no authority has been cited in support of the enunciation of the rule that there is a general principle of law that time does not run against a minor after full consideration we have come to the conclusion that the authority relied on in the passage cited does not show that according to the english law infancy is an answer to a plea of limitation strictly infants were not prevented by the letter of the custom they were not bound by other customs like this there was no necessity to construe them to be within the custom lord < name > says that the limitation of actions was by force of diverse acts of parliament although at a very remote time in england there was undoubtedly a stated time for the heir of the tenants to claim after the death of his ancestor and in case of non claim before the expiration of the time a year and a day the claimant was without remedy he states that under the common law the presumption arose alter a long time in respect to a legal claim that it had been satisfied section says i think truly prescription although it be by positive law founded upon utility more than upon equity the introduction whereof the romans ascribed to themselves yet hath it been since received by most nations but not so as to be counted amongst the laws of nations because it is not the same but different in diverse nations as to the matter manner and the time of it it is both fair and expedient that there should be provisions to enlarge the time when the true owners are under disabilities or for any other reason are not to be considered guilty of laches in not using their right within the specified period and such provisions there were in the lioman law and commonly are in modern statutes of limitations but i take it that these are positive laws founded on expedience and varying in different countries and at different times < name > in his work on limitation observes although says < name > there was no other reason to justify the introduction and use of prescription than that of public policy it would be just to prevent the property of things from being constantly in a state of uncertainty he goes on to say the true rule on this subject is laid down by sir < name > in his opinion in < org > on the case of earl of buckinghamshire < name > wilm accordingly we find that in the great case of < name > lord < name > plowden upon the statute of fines of henry the seventh where the question was whether when the bar by five years", "non claim had begun to run in the time of the ancestor of lull age it should continue to run against his infant heir although there was great difference of opinion among the judges upon that question the whole argument turns upon the true construction of the statute itself with reference to all the parts of it and to the object it had in view and not upon any supposed inherent equity by which infants were to be excepted out of the operation of the statutes of limitation on the contrary it is laid down in that case and laid down without any contradiction for as much as they intended that is the < org > intended to avoid universal trouble fas the preamble speaks and to make peace which is to be preferred before all other things and for as much as they have made the provision general viz we have no hesitation in saying that the same view must be held in this country also the earliest statutes of limitation in india therefore made express provisions in favour of minors we cannot therefore uphold the argument that there is any fundamental rule of law or justice entitling the appellant to claim that the limitation should run only from the date of his attaining majority it is next contended for the appellant that the application is not barred in so far as the claim for < org > profits is concerned even if section of the civil procedure code would be a bar so far as partition is concerned section enacted that with regard to < org > profits prior to the institution of the suit the < org > may either determine the amount by the decree itself or may pass a decree for the property and direct an enquiry into the amount of < org > profits and dispose of the same on further orders it is argued that the expression the < org > executing the deoree merely designates the < org > which is to hold the enquiry into < org > profits and that the provision in section does not make the enquiry a matter relating to the execution of the decree where the < org > profits relate to the period before the decree it may be said that the decree should strictly speaking determine all the rights of the plaintiff including the claim to < org > profits up to the date of the decree but it is doubtful whether this argument can apply to < org > profits subsequent to decree the language of clause of that section any other question relating to the execution shows that the enquiry into the amount of < org > profits was also to be regarded as a question relating to execution it may be right to hold that within the meaning of section of the repealed", "code the twelve years prescribed therein for the execution of a decree for money would run only from the date when the < org > profits are ascertained for it may be said that until that is done it cannot be said that there is a decree for money there although there was a declaration that the original defendants were liable for < org > profits the decree did not determine the important question whether the defendants were liable jointly or severally in respect of wrongful occupation there was no adjudication upon any of these matters until a long time after the original decree and until after the death of the defendants whose representatives were sought to be made liable their lordships did not decide any question of limitation the < org > had no power to give such a direction according to section of the present code the execution of all decrees except a decree granting an injunction will be barred after the expiration of twelve years but it is contended that this case must be decided according to the provisions of the present procedure code which by order xx rule directs that in a suit for the recovery of immoveable property and mesne profits the < org > may direct an enquiry as to the mesne profits and should pass a final decree in accordance with the result of the enquiry in this view an application for the ascertainment of mesne profits would not be one for execution of the decree though the question might then arise whether article would not apply to such an application the effect to be given to a document and to the proceedings of a < org > must be decided by the law in force when the document was executed or the proceedings were passed lastly it is contended that the application is not barred at any rate so far as the recovery of out standings is concerned inasmuch as they had not been collected by the defendants at the time of the decree according to which the plaintiffs are entitled to recover their share when the out standings are collected in the result the appeal is dismissed with costs

{"query": "title remains in him all the while and so a reconveyance is unnecessary but if there is an out and out sale the title could not revert to the original owner without a proper reconveyance it is true the words of conveyance in the earlier part of the deed clause would pass an absolute title if they stood alone but the document must be read as a whole and it must also be remembered that it was executed by ignorant justice and scribed by a man whose knowledge of conveyancing was on the face of it rudimentary and defective for its ambiguities that there is ambiguity is patent from what we have said the first point there is to see whether there is an ostensible sale that means a transaction which takes the outward form of a sale for the essence of a mortgage by conditional sale is that though in substance it is a mortgage it is couched in the form of a sale with certain conditions attached the ones relevant to the present purpose are contained in clauses and those are not the actual words used but in our opinion that is a fair construction of their meaning when the document is read as a whole if that is what they mean as we hold they do then the matter falls squarely within the ambit of section now as we have already said once a transaction is embodied in one document and not two and once its terms are covered by section then it must be taken to be a mortgage by conditional sale unless there are express words to indicate the contrary or in a case of ambiguity the attendant circumstances necessarily lead to the opposite conclusion there are no express words here which say that this is not a mortgage but there is ambiguity so we must probe further the respondents who claim that this is a sale and not a mortgage rely on the following circumstances next they point to clause where the executants say that they have no other means of raising the money they want except by selling the property the word mortgage is also used in clause therefore it is clear that when a mortgage is intended the word mortgage is used the only weakness in this argument is that when a mortgage is by conditional sale this is the form it has to take because section postulates that there must be an ostensible sale and if a sale is ostensible it must necessarily contain all the outward indicate of a real sale the question we are considering can only arise when the word sale is used and

suspense account or reserve for doubtful interest account in stead of crediting the same to interest account or profit and loss account is a universally recognised practice invariably adopted by them and being wholly consistent with the mercantile system of accounting the income tax officer was bound to give effect to it under section of the act and therefore the treatment of the three sums representing interest on sticky loans as the assessee income for the concerned years would be unsustainable in law on behalf of the < org > it was contended that though it is the real income that is chargeable to tax under the act and not any hypothetical income of an assessee and that under section in respect of a business the chargeability must attach to real profits and gains arising from the transactions of the previous year but under section read with section of the act the liability attaches to profits which have been either received by the assessee or which have accrued to him during the year of account and that income accrues when it falls due i becomes legally recoverable irrespective of whether actually received or not and accrued income is that income which the assessee has a legal", "right to receive and since the assessee has been maintaining its accounts on mercantile basis the three sums being interest on loans whether doubtful or sticky fell due and became payable to the assessee at the end of each of the three accounting years and constituted its accrued income and therefore justifiably brought to tax in the concerned assessment years that though while imposing the tax liability under the act the courts have recognised the theory of real income by having regard to the business character of the transactions and realities of the situation but these aspects have been taken into account for the purpose of determining whether the income could be said to have legally accrued or not and once it is found to have legally accrued it is brought to tax and that the theory of real income has been invoked and confined only to two types of cases a where there has been a surrender of income which may in theory have accrued and where there has been diversion of income at source either under a statute or by over riding title but in none of the cases has the aspect of high improbability of recovery been regarded as sufficient to prevent accrual therefore the theory of real income should not be extended so as to exclude from chargeability such income which has accrued but merely suffers from high improbability of recovery because such extention would be neither permissible nor advisable not permissible because it goes against the very concept of accrued income and not advisable because if done it will apply to all cases and not merely to cases of interest accruing to banks and financial institutions however in examining any transaction or situation the court would have more regard to the reality of the situation rather than purely theoretical or doctrinaire aspect a sum of money as soon as it becomes payable is taken into account without reference to actual receipt and a debit becomes admissible when liability to pay is created even though the sum of money is yet to be paid after debiting the debtor account and not reversing that entry but taking the interest merely in suspense account cannot be such evidence to show that no real income has accrued to the assessee or treated as such by the assessee it must depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case in some limited fields where something which is the reality of the situation prevents the accrual of the income then the notion of the real income i making the income accrue in the real sense of the term can be brought into play but the notion of real income cannot be brought into play where income has accrued according to the accounts of assessee and there is no indication by the assessee to treat the amount as not having accrued", "the following judgments were delivered tulzapurkar these appeals by certificate from < org > raise the following two interesting questions of law for our determination whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the addition of the sum of rs arising on devaluation of the indian rupee on was rightly treated as income for the assessment year the facts giving rise to the first question lie in a narrow compass and are these profit and loss account and despite the fact that the assessee bank had in pursuance thereof ommitted such interest from its profit and loss account the court had taken the view that such interest was taxable as income in the hands of the assessee bank because of the mercantile system of accounting that had been regularly employed by it which had not been changed even after receiving the directive from < org > incidentally it may be stated in the case of this very assessee < org > following the decision herein took a similar view and answered a similar question against the assessee for the subsequent year which decision rendered in is reported in itr mr < name > the learned counsel for the assessee raised a two fold contention in support of his plea that the three sums representing interest on sticky advances i advances in respect whereof there was high improbability of recovery of even the principal amounts ought not to have been subjected to tax as income under the act in the first place he contended that what are chargeable to income tax in respect of a business are profits and gains actually resulting from the transactions of the previous year that is to say the real profits and gains and not hypothetical profits or gains on a doctrinaire theory of accrual that even under the mercantile system of accounting regularly adopted by an assessee it is only the accrual

as interest on sticky advances is concerned and the debit entries made in respect of such interest in the respective accounts of the concerned debtors following the mercantile system of accounting merely reflect hypothetical income that does not materialise in the concerned accounting year or years", "during which the advances remain sticky and hence it is but proper to carry such interest to interest suspense account as carrying the same to profit and loss account would result in showing inflated profits and might even lead to improper and illegal distribution or remittance thereof according to counsel there is a clear distinction between an irrecoverable loan and a sticky loan the former is a bad debt in respect whereof the chance of recovery is nil and as such can out right form the subject matter of deduction under vii of the act while the latter is a loan to which a high degree of improbability of recovery attaches in a particular year or years depending upon the financial position of the concerned debtor due to which interest thereon becomes hypothetical income duringsuch year or years and as such the same not being real income cannot be brought to tax counsel pointed out that right from august onwards till the impugned decision herein as also the further decision in itr were rendered by < org > in and respectively the aforesaid distinction between an irrecoverable loan and a stickly loan was recognised by < org > as also by < org > in their diverse circulars in the case of banks financial institutions and money lenders regularly following the mercantile system of accounting and he further pointed out that instructions had been issued not to treat the unrealised interest on such sticky loan as income by carrying it to profit and loss account so that the figure of distributable profits should not get inflated and preferably to credit the same to a special account such as interest suspense account and that if the banks financial institutions and money lenders who kept their accounts on mercantile system maintained such a suspense account in which the unrealised interest was entered the same should not be included in the assessee taxable income if the income tax officer was satisfied that there was really little probability of the loans being repaid counsel urged that such instructions contained in these circulars were in consonance with the accepted principle that what was chargeable under the income tax act was the real income of an assessee but according to him these instructions which held field for over years were changed though wrongly under fresh circulars dated june and october issued by < org > whereunder such interest on doubtful or sticky loans became includible in the assessable income of the assessee subject to some relief specified therein with effect from the assessment year secondly counsel contended that in any view of the matter in the case of banks and financial institutions who regularly adopt mercantile system of accounting the practice of carrying interest on such", "sticky loans to interest suspense account or reserve for doubtful interest account instead of crediting the same to interest account or profit and loss account is a universally recoginsed practice invariably adopted by them and being wholly consistent with the mercantile system of accounting the income tax officer was bound to give effect to it under of the act and therefore the treatment of the three sums representing interest on sticky loans as the assessee income for the concerned assessment years would be unsustainable in law and in this behalf counsel placed reliance on the standard text books of accountancy of authors like < name > and < name > < name > and < name > and the approved text of international accounting standard < org > through its successors < org > < org > < org > < org > and < org > of india sought our permission to intervene in these appeals and we granted the requisite permission in view of the importance of the issues involved and it may be stated that counsel appearing for the interveners have adopted the arguments of mr < name > and generally supported the submissions made by him on behalf of the assessee in these appeals but special mention may be made of the fact that in the written submissions filed on their behalf it has been categorically asserted that while maintaining their accounts regularly on mercantile system each one of these institutions in the matter of interest on doubtful or sticky loans invariably follow the practice of debiting such interest to the account of concerned borrower but instead of crediting it to interest account or profit and loss account the same is carried to a special account styled interest suspense account or reserve for doubtful interest account and only upon realisation the same is credited to interest account and profit and loss account in the year of realisation and is offered for taxation counsel reiterated on behalf of the intervenees that the benefit under the earlier circulars of and i did not depend upon the ipse dixit of the assessee but was available only if the safeguards specified therein were observed and the taxing authority was satisfied on objective materials that the loan had become sticky and there was really little probability of the same being repaid counsel for the revenue fairly conceded that courts have while imposing the tax liability under the act recognised the theory of real income by having regard to the business character of the transactions and realities of the situation but these aspects have been taken into account for the purpose of determining whether the income could be said to have legally accrued or not and once it is found to have legally accrued it is brought to tax counsel submitted such extension would be neither permissible", "nor advisable not permissible because it goes against the very concept of accrued income and not adyisable because if done it will apply to all cases and not merely to cases of interest accruing to banks and financial institutions having regard to the rival contentions urged before us by counsel on either side it is clear that the following questions do arise for our serious consideration on the first issue raised for determination in these appeals did the three sums representing interest on sticky loans constitute real income of the assessee for the concerned assessment years had such income really accrued to the assessee for those years does real accrual of income depend on its falling due by mere lapse of requisite contractual period at the end of which it becomes legally payable or upon the business character of the transaction and the realities of the situation how far is the method of accounting regularly adopted by the assessee here mercantile relevant for deciding the question of real accrual what is the effect of making debit entries in respect of such interest in the respective accounts of the concerned debtors under the mercantile system of accounting and lastly can and should the theory of real income be extended so as to exclude a particular income from chargeability under the act because of high improbability of recovery attaching to it in the concerned accounting year or years we would like to deal with these questions in the light of decided cases section provides that income chargeable under the head profits and gains of business shall be computed in accordance with the method of accounting regularly employed by the assessee provided that in any case where the accounts are correct and completed to the satisfaction of the income tax officer but the method is such that in his opinion the income cannot be properly deduced therefrom then the computation shall be made upon such basis and in such manner as the income tax officer may determine but where he is not satisfied about the correctness or completeness of the accounts of the assessee or where no method of accounting has been regularly employed by the assessee he can proceed to make the assessment to the best of his judgment this is made clear by defining in subsection the word paid which is used in several clauses of sub section as meaning actually paid or incurred according to the method of accounting upon the basis of which the profits or gains are computed under section again where the cash system is adopted there is no question of bad debts or outstandings at all in the case of mercantile system against the book profit some of the bad debts may have to be set off when they are found to be irrecoverable on the aspect as to how far and", "to what extent a method of accounting has a bearing on the question of real accrual of income the < org > has made the following significant observation at page of the report but the section section of the act equivalent to section of the act only deals with a computation of income profits and gains for the purposes of sections and sections and of the act and does not purport to enlarge or restrict the content of taxable income profits and gains under the act obviously for the content of taxable income one must have regard to the substantive charging provisions of the act in other words any hypothetical income which may have the oretically accrued but has not truly resulted or materialised in the concerned accounting year cannot be brought to charge simply because the assessee has been regularly employing the mercantile system of accounting and makes entries in his books in regard to such hypothetical income in the light of above i would recapitulate the admitted facts and the manner in which the assessee treated or dealt with the three sums representing interest on sticky loans in its books pursuant to the mercantile system of accounting regularly adopted by it the facts that the advances or loans had during the concerned accounting years become sticky and that such interest had not materialised or resulted to the assessee in those years were not disputed but as stated earlier the claim was negatived by the taxing authorities and the < org > on the ground that the advances or loans had not been treated as irrecoverable or bad debts under vii that the aspect that the advances or loans had become sticky was irrelevant that since the assessee was following the mercantile system of accounting such interest has accrued to it at the end of each accounting year and that the assessee had itself shown the accrual of interest by changing the same to the concerned parties by making debit entries in their accounts as regards the mercantile system of accounting regularly employed by the assessee there are two aspects which we like to stress in other words simply because the assessee has been regularly employing the mercantile system of accounting it would not mean that any hypothetical income which may have theoretically accrued but has not truly resulted to him in the concerned accounting year can be brought to charge and therefore the question whether the three sums representing interest on sticky loans had really accrued to the assessee or not would be a matter of substance and cannot be determined by merely having regard to the method of accounting here mercantile system adopted by the assessee secondly it will have to be", "borne in mind that this is not a case where the assessee had ignored or failed to make any entries at all in regard to such interest on advances or loans which had become sticky in its books maintained on mercantile system but it had charged such interest by debiting the accounts of concerned debtors and had designedly credited it to interest suspense account instead of carrying it to profit and loss account with a view to avoid showing unreal or inflated profits counsel for the assessee pointed out that after all the primary purpose of book keeping whatever be the method of accounting was to make a systematic record of business transactions in a manner which must show the correct financial position of a business house at a given point of time and reflect the real and true profits of the business done by it during the year of account and contended that in treating the three sums in question in the manner done the assessee had merely followed a universally recognised practice invariably adopted by banks and financial institutions who maintain their accounts on mercantile system and what was more this practice accorded with the principle that no item should be treated as income unless it has been actually received or has accrued in the sense that there is reasonable certainty that it will be realised i find considerable force in this contention of counsel for the assessee turning to the first question it is true that under taxabillity is attracted not merely when income is actually received but also when it has accrued and it is also true as has been explained by this < org > in < name > case supra and < org > case supra that income accrues when it falls due that is to say when it becomes legally recoverable irrespective of whether it is actually received or not and accrued income is that income which the assessee has a legal right to receive incidentally it may be stated that in both of these cases where the legal aspect of accrual has been explained no question of applying the doctrine of real income could arise for in the former case after the commission payable to the managing agents had accrued at the end of the accounting year the managed company had instead of paying it kept it in a suspense account pending settlement of a dispute in regard to another debt owed to it by the managing agents which proposed settlement was ultimately rejected and the < org > held that such keeping it in the suspense account pending settlement of another indebtedness would not prevent its accrual to the managing agents while in the other case a unilateral relinquishment of the commission by the managing agents was after its accrual and hence the < org > ruled that", "it could not escape liability to tax emphasis supplied the above observations were made in the context of these facts but as a result of resolutions passed by the managed company and the assessee company the assessee gave up a sum of rs it will be significant to mention that during the hearing of the reference counsel for the revenue raised a contention that even if the amount of rs had been foregone by the assessee company on grounds of commercial expediency that was not done in the accounting year which ended on march but it was done in december as a result of two resolutions one passed by the managed company and the other passed by the assessee company and that since admittedly the assessee was following the mercantile system of accounting it could not avail of the benefit of the doctrine of real income where the income by way of the managing agency commission had been credited in the books in the year of account and had been surrendered by it in the next year in other words it was specifically urged that if the surrender was not made and entered in the books in the same year no question of real income could arise and in this behalf counsel relied upon the well settled rule that for purposes of income tax each year was required to be regarded as a distinct and self contained unit mr < name > counsel for the revenue also is not prepared to go so far as that and has fairly stated that there is no antithesis between the two rules we shall proceed on the footing that the assessee company having followed the mercantile system of account there must have been entries made in its books in the accounting year in respect of the amount of the commission odd is to be regarded as of cogency in the context of the present point of real income and if it be remembered that the surrender was made at the time of ascertaining the quantum of the commission payable to the assessee company and further if it be remembered as now found by the < org > that the surrender was made bona fide and on grounds solely of commercial expediency it seems very difficult to us to see how the < org > is justified in contending that the real income of the assessee was something different than the amount of rs the < org > further expressed the view that the principle of real income was not to be so subordinated as to amount virtually to a negation of it when a surrender or concession or rebate in respect of managing agency commission is made agreed to or given up on grounds of commercial expediency simply because it takes place some time after", "the close of the accounting year and that in examining any transaction and situation of this nature the < org > would have more regard to the reality and speciality of the situation rather than the purely theoretical or doctrinaire aspect of it and it will lay greater emphasis on the business aspect of the matter viewed as a whole when that can be done without disregarding the decision of the bombay high < org > has been fully approved by this < org > in < org > case supra if therefore for the purpose of determining whether there has been accrual of real income or not regard is to be had to the business character of the transactions and the realities and specialities of the situation in preference to theoretical doctrinaire or legalistic approach i fail to appreciate why interest on sticky loans which has theoretically accrued but has not factually resulted or materialised at all to an assessee hypothetical income and not real income there is no reason why the factum of stickiness of loans operating throughout the accounting period or periods not on the basis of mere ipse dixit of the assessee but on being objectively established to the satisfaction of the taxing authorities by reference to the facts showing the deteriorating financial position of the concerned debtors and the history of their accounts should not have the effect of preventing the accrual of interest thereon as real income to the assessee if voluntary relinquishment or surrender of income done unilaterally or as a result of bilateral arrangement can prevent its real accrual there is no reason why the factum of stickiness of loans objectively established should not prevent accrual of interest thereon as real income i am therefore clearly of the view that the stickiness of advances or loans objectively established to the satisfaction of the taxing authorities by producing proper material is sufficient to prevent the accrual of interest thereon as real income and would have the effect of rendering such income hypothetical and the same cannot be brought to tax counsel for the revenue raised two objections to extend the theory of real income so as to exclude from chargeability the interest on sticky loans merely because it suffers from high improbability of recovery in the first place he urged that the act contains no provision excluding or deducting such interest from computation of income and the only provision for deduction of debts is to be found in vii where under debts which are established to have become irrecoverable and bad in the previous year are permitted to be deducted on fulfilment of certain conditions specified in sub section and as such the extension of the theory of real income as sought would entrench upon", "vi secondly it was urged that such extension will be ill advised inasmuch as if done it will apply to cases of interest accruing to all money lenders and not merely to cases of interest accruing to banks and financial institutions proceeds on the basis that in substance such debts do not constitute real income of the assessee and therefore exclusion of interest on sticky loans from computation of income for which there is no provision in the act and that too without any conditions would impinge upon the specific provision contained in vii read with sub section moreover there is a clear distinction between an irrecoverable loan and a sticky loan the former would be a bad debt in respect whereof the chances of recovery are almost nil having been written off the same can form the subject matter of a deduction under vii while the latter is a loan to which a high degree of improbability of recovery attaches in a particular year or years due to which interest thereon becomes hypothetical income and not real income during the said year or years and therefore it cannot be brought to tax though if realised subsequently the same could be and ought to be brought to tax if this distinction is borne in mind no question of impinging upon the provision contained in vii read with sub section can arise by extending the theory of real income to the interest on sticky loans directly on the point at issue there are five decisions which we need consider in < name > case decided by < org > the items of interest receivable from two parties on advances made to them were sought to be excluded from computation of income of the assessee for on the ground that since the assessee had decided to change its method of accounting in respect of interest which was doubtful of recovery by crediting the same to the suspense account and also on the ground that before the closing of the books of account of the relevant accounting year the assessee had adbandoned its claim for such interest < org > held that there was no change in the mercantile system of accounting that had all along been empolyed by the assessee that the transfer of items of interest to suspense account could not be termed as a change in the method of accounting and therefore the amounts were assessable on accrual basis as regards the other ground < org > held that though there was difficulty in realising the interest in the year of account there was no material to show that there was any agreement with the debtors to waive the interest or to keep it in the suspense account and hence the claim for interest had not", "been given up as the assessee company was advised that there was no prospect of recovering even the principal amount it did not credit the interest on the outstandings from the two firms even though it was adopting the mercantile system of accounting on a reference at the instance of the commissioner the madras high court held that the < org > was right in its conclusion that though the assessee had adopted the mercantile system of accounting no interest income could be assessed in its hands on accrual basis and it would be very unrealistic on the part of the assessee to take credit for the highly illusory interest it further observed that it was not the hypothetical accrual of income based on the mercantile system of accounting followed by the assessee that had to be taken into account but what should be considered was whether the income had really materialised or resulted to the assessee and that question had to be considered with reference to commercial and business realities of the situation in which the assessee had been placed and not with reference to his system of accounting and held that since there was not even the remotest possibility of any interest income materialising in favour of the assessee in respect of the outstandings for the accounting year relevant to the assessment year in question no liability to tax could be imposed on the assessee i approve these three decisions having regard to the above discussion it is clear that the three sums representing interest on sticky advances in the instant case being hypothetical and not real income of the assessee could not be brought to tax for the three concerned assessment years and we answer the first question in the negative in favour of the assessee and against the revenue of course it goest without saying that if and when these sums or any part thereof are realised subsequently the same could be brought to tax in the year of realisation the facts giving rise to the question are these amounting to in us dollars and in sterling which when converted back to rupees at the post devaluation rates gave rise to a profit of or rs it was contended on behalf of the assessee before the lower taxing authorities that this profit should not be taxed as it was of a casual and nonrecurring nature the contention was negatived by the authorities on the ground that even assuming without conceding that it was a windfall and therefore of a casual nature the same had arisen from the business activities of the assessee bank and therefore was not exempt but was liable to tax before < org > an attempt was made by counsel for the assessee", "bank to contend that the cash balance in terms of dollars and sterlings at the end of the accounting period i on december was higher than that as existed on the crucial date namely august and therefore this precluded any inference that the stock of dollars and sterlings that existed on the devaluation date had been converted into indian currency thus resulting in profits the < org > rejected the contention as being without force inasmuch as the assessee bank had revalued the cost of foreign exchange in terms of rupees as on the date of devaluation to bring it on par with the post devaluation rate by giving a corresponding credit to the provision for contingencies thus treating the surplus resulting from the fluctuation of exchange rate as its income and the mere fact that the same had been carried to the account style provision for contingencies did not alter the true character of the transaction having regard to the aforesaid factual position i confirm < org > view that the second question has to be answered in the affirmative in favour of the < org > and against the assessee in the result i would allow the appeals in so far as the first question is concerned and dismiss the same as regards the second question the following two questions are involved in these appeals whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the addition of the sums of rs rs arising on revaluation of the indian rupee on was rightly treated as income of the assessment year in view of the categorical findings of fact recorded by the < org > authorities and the < org > and mentioned in the judgment of < name > i am in respectful agreement with the opinion of < name > that < org > was right and the second question must be answered in the affirmative and in favour of the revenue and the appeals on this aspect must be dismissed it is necesary for this reason to reiterate in brief the facts relating to the first question in view of the relevant years involved the question must be considered in the light of the provisions of the income tax act hereinafter called the act this contention was however rejected by the income tax authorities as well as < org > reliance was placed by < org > on an earlier decision of the same < org > in the case of < org > in liquidation vs < org > kerala ernakulam in that case in spite of the directions issued by < org > to the assessee bank not to carry interest of such sticky advances to profit and loss account and also in spite of the fact that the assessee bank in", "pursuance of these directions omitted their interest from its profit and loss account the court took the view that such interest was taxable as income in the hands of the assessee bank because the mercantile system of accounting had been regularly followed by the bank and that had not been changed even after receiving directions from < org > < org > was of the view that the facts of the instant case out of which these appeals arise being the same as those in < org > case except that there was a direction from < org > to < org > which is absent in the instant case before us the same conclusion must follow the assessee indubitably maintained its accounts on mercantile basis and had regularly adopted it the assessee claimed that the three sums represented interests on what it called sticky loans in its books of account but having regard to the deteriorating financial position of the concerned debtors and the history of these accounts the assessee was of the view that in the relevant years the advances had become so sticky that even the recovery of the principal amounts had become highly improbable and extremely doubtful therefore though the assessee charged such interests by debiting the concerned parties emphasis supplied yet it credited the said amounts to a separate account styled as interest suspense account it was submitted that even under the mercantile system of accounting accrual or real income in the commercial sense only was chargeable to tax and this must accrue in substance according to the realities of the situation it was submitted that if regard is had to realities of the situation as well as the actual commercial principles it would be evident that in cases of banks financial institutions and money lenders bulk of the income is usually earned by way of interest and as such there cannot be any accrual of real income from interest on doubtful advances or sticky advances and therefore the entries made in respect of such accounts in case of all such traders following the mercantile system of accounting only reflected hypothetical income which does not materialise in income a sum of money as soon as it becomes payable is taken into account without reference to actual receipt and a debit becomes admissible when liability to pay is created even though the sum of money is yet to be paid it was indicated therein that when there was unlikelihood of loans being recovered interests from such loans need not be included in the taxable income if the income tax officer was satisfied that there was really little possibility of the loans being repaid there is also a letter dated th april from the under secretary < org > referring to letter dated th march reiterating that", "the amounts kept in suspense account under those circumstances would not be taxable in that letter reference was made to the previous circulars and it was pointed out that the stand taken in these circulars was not acceptable to < org > and it had objected to the exclusion of such amounts of interest from the total income it was urged that the instructions contained in these circulars noted before were in consonance with the accepted principles of accountancy and these instructions have held the field for over years the question of how far the concept or real income enters into the question of taxability in the facts and circumstances of this case and how far and to what extent the concept of real income should inter mingle with the accrual of income will have to be judged in the light of the provisions of the act the principles of accountancy recognised and followed and the feasibility there is no dispute in these appeals that such conditions are not satisfied sub section of the said section provides that income chargeable under the head profits and gains of business or profession or income from other sources shall be computed in accordance with the method of accounting regularly employed by the assessee the < org > held that the assessee was being assessed on cash basis in previous years that the income had not accrued to the assessee and that the sum of rs < org > came to the conclusion that there was no material for the < org > finding that the assessee was being assessed on cash basis in the previous years but held < name > confirming the decision of the appellate <

cash basis on the sums mentioned which had accrued to the assessee and it did not cease to be income the learned chief justice observed at page of the report now there are two methods of accounting for the income profits and gains of a business which are generally referred to as the cash basis and the mercantitle basis lord thankerton speaking for < org > after referring to section of act which was more or less similar to section of the present act observed at page as follows their lordships are clearly of opinion that the section relates to a method of accounting regularly employed by the assessee for his own purposes in this case for the purposes of the company business and does not relate to a method of making up the statutory return", "of assessment to income tax this is made clear by defining in sub section the word paid which is used in several clauses of sub section as meaning actually paid or incurred according to the method of accounting upon the basis of which the profits or gains are computed under section again where the cash system is adopted there is no question of bad debts or outstanding at all in the case of mercantile system against the book profits some of the bad debts may have to be set of when they are found to be irrecoverable for the content of the taxable income one has to refer to the substantive provisions of the act mainly section of the act read with other relevant sections it may be reiterated that in some limited fields where something which is the reality of the situation prevents the accrual of the income then the notion of real income i making the income accrue in the real sense of the term can be brought into play but the notion of real income as it shall presently be indicated cannot be brought into play where income has accrued according to the accounts of the assessee and there is no indication by the assessee to treat the amount as not having accrued in that case there was provision for reduction of commission where profits were insufficient in case of the managing agent but as a result of the resolutions passed by the managed company and the assessee company the assessee gave up a sum of rs the principle of real income is not to be so subordinated to virtually amount to a negation of it when a surrender or concession or rebate in respect of managing agency commission is made agreed to or given on grounds of commercial expediency simply because it takes place some time after the close of an accounting year in examining any transaction and situation of this nature the court would have more regard to the reality and speciality of the situation rather than the purely theoretical and doctrinaire aspect of it under the agreement there was a duty to forgo upto one third of the commission where profit of the managed company was not sufficient to pay a divident of per cent carrying certain amount which had accrued as interest without treating it as bad debt or irrecoverable interest but keeping in suspense account would be repugnant to section vii read with section of the act in that view of the matter < name > case would not be of any assistance to the assessee for the contentions it sought to urge before this court in the instant case dealing with < name > case this court observed that an argument was advanced before this court that as the assessee was maintaining its accounts on mercantile", "basis the commission had accrued this contention did not find favour with this court because this court noted that no due date was fixed for payment of the commission under the managing agency agreement it was held in that case after discussing the facts that there were hardly any receipts in respect of items of interest or that the bona fides of the assessee in not charging interest were not disputed were circumstances which were by themselves insufficient to support the conclusion that there was no real income in respect of the items of interest as none of the debts due by the several debtors was written off by the assessee and no evidence was produced to show that interest in respect of the debts was given up the assessee has not only not written off but it is still treating loans as alive by keeping them in suspense account it urged that it had decided to change st january its method of accounting in respect of interest which was doubtful of recovery and that such interest was thence forward credited to the suspense account the < org > held that there was no change in the method of accounting and that before the closing of the books of account of the relevant accounting year the assessee had not abandoned its claim of interest and as such the amounts were assessable on accrual basis there is no claim that there was any change in the method of accounting < org > further held in < name > case that though there was difficulty in realising the interests in the year of account there was no material to show that there was any agreement with the debtors to waive the interest or to keep these in suspense account i the assessee a private company was carrying on business as financier for purchase of motor vehicles on hire purchase as the assessee company was advised that there was no prospect of recovering even the principal amount the assessee company did not credit the interest on the outstandings from the two companies even though it was adopting the mercantile system of accounting therefore there was no question of paying any hiring charges or interest if no income had materialised it was pointed out there could be no liability to tax on any hypothetical accrual of income based on the mercantile system of accounting followed by the asessee that had to be taken into account but what should be considered was whether the income had really materialised or resulted to the assessee the question whether real income had materialised to the assessee had to be considered with reference to commercial and business realities of the situation the < org > was justified in < org > view that having regard to the terms of the", "agreement entered into between the parties and in the light of the entries contained in the accounts the commission could not be said to have accrued in favour of the assessee as commission could be earnt only after the entire advance had been realised < name > who delivered the judgment of the bench noted the distinction between < name > case and the case before him in < org > there the court came to the conclusion that there was no income in view of the particular facts and circumstances of the case it must depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case after debiting the debtor account and not reversing that entry but taking the interest merely in suspense account cannot be such evidence to show that no real income has accrued to the assessee or treated as such by the assessee but in view of the facts and circumstances of these cases parties will bear their own costs throughout < name > i have had the advantage of reading the two separate judgments by my learned brothren < name > and < name > < name > i am in agreement with both of them that the second question had been correctly answered in favour of the < org > by < org > and the appeals are to be dismissed on affirmation of that conclusion so far as that aspect is concerned reports the appeals

provided under section the petitioner cannot invoke writ jurisdiction of this court where in the context of appeal provided under section of the drt act < org > has held that when remedy of appeal was available < org > should not have entertained the petition under article of the constitution of india in this judgment < org > has held that the < org > can even go beyond", "the < org > and only

also placed heavy reliance on the judgment of < org > in < org > supra < org > observed that the employment of the said two monosyllables is of great jurisprudential import in the same clause dealing

that the submission that appeal provided under section is illusory has been dealt with by < org > in < org > supra mr < name > contended that there is enough indication in section a and explanation to

submitted written submissions though in < org >", "case supra < org > was considering whether withdrawal of a in terms of the first proviso to section of the drt act is a condition precedent to taking recourse to the npa act while dealing with this question < org > observed that three points arise for determination out of the those three points the point which is relevant for the present case is as follows whether recourse to take possession of the secured assets of the borrower in terms of section of the npa act comprehends the power to take actual possession of the immoveable property the npa act enables the banks and financial institutions to realise long term assets manage problems of liquidity asset liability mis match and to improve recovery of debts by exercising powers to take possession of securities sell them and thereby reduce non performing assets by adopting measures for recovery and reconstruction the npa act further provides for setting up of asset reconstruction companies which are empowered to take possession of secured assets of the borrower including the right to transfer by way of lease assignment or sale a the drt act did not provide for assignment of debts to securitisation companies the secured assets could not be liquidated in time the npa act was enacted to reduce mounting non performing assets by empowering banks to liquidate the assets and secured interest the npa act deals with crystallized liabilities the npa act proceeds on the basis that the asset is created in favour of bank which could be assigned to the assets management company which steps into the shoes of the secured creditors section proceeds on the basis that the borrower is under a liability and his account in the books of account of the bank is classified as sub standard or doubtful or loss the npa act comes into force only if these two conditions are satisfied since section deals with liquidation of liability on the basis that the account of the borrower has become non performing there is no scope of any dispute regarding liability the npa act does not deal with disputes between the secured creditors and the borrowers but it deals with the rights of the secured creditors interse section and section of the npa act proceed on the basis that the security interest in the bank and financial institution needs to be enforced expeditiously without the intervention of the < org > and that enforcement could take place by non adjudicatory process the npa act provides for recovery of possession by non adjudicatory process the npa act removes all fetters on the right of the secured creditor i under section the < org > is required to consider whether any of the measures referred to in section are in accordance with the provisions of the npa act and the rules made thereunder if while examining the application under section the drt comes to the", "conclusion that any of the measures taken under section are not in accordance with npa act it shall direct the secured creditor to restore the possession to the borrower or restore management to the borrower if the < org > declares that the recourse taken under section is in accordance with the provisions of the npa act then notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force the secured creditor shall be entitled to take recourse to anyone or more of the measures as specified under section to recover his secured debt section shows that the secured creditor is free to take recourse to any one of the measures under section notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force for the sake of argument if in a given case the measures undertaken by the secured creditor under section come in conflict with the < org > land revenue law then notwithstanding such conflict the provision of section shall override the local law this position stands clarified by section of the npa act which states that the provisions of the npa act shall override all other laws which are inconsistent with the npa act section gives an overriding effect to the npa act over all other laws if they are in consistent with it the dichotomy between symbolic and physical possession does not find place in the npa act rule of the said rules deals with the sale of immoveable secured assets rule deals with the stage anterior to the issuance of sale certificate and delivery of possession under rule rule relates to time of sale issue of sale certificate and delivery of possession the court receiver can take symbolic possession and in appropriate cases he can take actual possession even prior to the decree the authorised officer powers are greater as security interest is already created in the bank hence under rule he can take steps to preserve the secured asset till issuance of the sale certificate under rule rule states that on confirmation of sale if the terms of payment are complied with the authorised officer shall issue a sale certificate in favour of the purchaser rule states that the authorised officer shall deliver the property to the buyer free from all encumbrances known to the secured creditor or not known to the secured creditor this scheme of the npa act therefore does not disclose any dichotomy between symbolic possession and physical possession since scheme of section read with section shows that if the borrower is dispossessed not in accordance with the provisions of the npa act the drt is entitled to restore status quo ante it cannot be said that if possession is taken before confirmation of sale the rights of the borrower to get the dispute adjudicated upon is defeated by the authorised officer taking possession the disputes which are sought to be avoided by rule read with rule of", "the said rules are those where third party interests are created overnight and in very many cases those third parties take up the defence of being a bonafide purchaser for value without notice if any reply is submitted by the borrower the bank has to consider it and if it does not accept it it has to communicate the reasons to the borrower there is no scope for any dispute regarding liability section and proceed on the basis that the security interest in the bank and financial institution needs to be enforced expeditiously without intervention of the court by non adjudicatory process till application under section is made there is no adjudication of any kind if possession is given without resistance there is no need of approaching the cmm dm under section the argument that taking physical possession of secured asset is not contemplated under the npa act must be rejected in view of the clear observation of < org > in < org > case that the dichotomy between symbolic and physical possession does not find place in the npa act similarly when the secured creditor approaches < org > for assistance to take possession of the secured asset the liability having been crystallized there can be no adjudication about it at that stage there is no question of pointing out to < org > at that stage that the person who is to be dispossessed is a tenant or that he has a prior registered sale deed or that in case of simple mortgage ownership rights are not transferred that the mortgagee is only entitled to an obligation to pay and hence possession cannot be taken or that such a course will improve or change the contract etc grievance that reasons for not accepting the objections were not communicated can also not be raised at that stage because consideration of reply is in the realm of adjudication which cannot be done under section besides as per proviso to section a and explanation to section non communication of reasons to the borrower does not confer on the borrower or any person right to prefer an application under section at the stage of communication remedy is provided in section where appropriate relief can be given to them in any case it is also held by < org > in < org > case supra that if the measures undertaken by the secured creditor come in conflict with any other law the provisions of section override these provisions and that section gives an overriding effect to the npa act we also find no substance in the submission that remedy of appeal application provided under section of the npa act is illusory in this connection we may usefully refer to the judgment of < org > in < org > supra the argument that it will not be possible to produce any documents there that there objection", "can be taken only to procedural irregularities about measures taken under section must also be rejected in this connection we may also refer to the judgment of < org > in < org > case supra in that case < org > has after referring to its earlier judgment reiterated that the < org > can travel beyond the < org > and the only fetter that is put on its powers is to observe the principles of natural justice < org > has further observed that the < org > can pass orders to secure the ends of justice it is also not possible for us to hold that remedy provided under section is not available to a third party this section begins with the words any person including borrower aggrieved by any of the measures referred to in sub section of section in our opinion the words any person including borrower cover third parties also under section a the secured creditor is required to communicate to the borrower reasons for not accepting his objection to the notice under section but the reasons so communicated does not confer any right on the borrower to make an application before the < org > under section explanation to section states that communication of reasons to the borrower does not entitle the person including borrower to make an application to < org > under section at the stage of communication < name > the learned counsel appearing for the respondent bank has drawn our attention to the judgments of the < org > where rights of third parties are dealt with and relief is granted to them there is also no substance in the submission that no relief can be given to a third party because section speaks only of restoration of possession of the secured asset to the borrower section states that if the < org > comes to the conclusion that any of the measures stated in section taken by the secured creditor are not in accordance with the npa act and the rules made thereunder it can restore possession of the secured assets to the borrower or restore the management of the secured asset to the borrower section further goes on to say that < org > can pass such order as it may consider appropriate and necessary in relation to any of the recourse taken by the secured creditor under sub section of section therefore there is no reason to conclude that no orders can be passed in respect of third parties by < org > under section section which provides for appeal to < org > also states that any person aggrieved by any order made by < org > under section may prefer an appeal to an < org > there is no provision under the npa act putting fetters on the drts powers particularly when in < or", "##g > case supra < org > has held that it can travel beyond the < org > and it can pass orders to secure ends of justice there is no doubt that a party who is likely to be adversely affected by any action must be given a hearing before the action is taken it proceeds on the basis that liability of the borrower is crystallized in our opinion to secure its object the npa act has by necessary implication ruled out giving hearing either to the borrower or third parties till the application is filed under section as observed by < org > in transcore scase supra section of the npa act inter alia states that the bank or financial institution may if it considers appropriate give a notice of acquisition of financial assets by any securitisation company or reconstruction company to the borrower and to any other concerned person but they may or may not give notice to the borrower regarding acquisition of financial assets the reason being that assets are transferable overnight section a requires the secured creditor to communicate to the borrower reasons for not accepting his representation or objection and proviso thereto states that such communication shall not confer right on the borrower to make an application under section at that stage section with which we are concerned here does not contemplate any notice to the borrower or a third party it is only section which states that any person including borrower can make an application to < org > being aggrieved by any measure taken under section explanation to section clarifies that reasons communicated to a borrower at the stage of communication will not confer on the person including borrower any right to make an application to < org > under section section again confers right on any person aggrieved by an order of < org > under section to file an appeal before < org > against the said order nothing prevented the legislature from specifically making a provision in section for notice to the borrower or third party it purposely did not make provision for notice or hearing being given to the borrower or third party at the stage of section though the validity fo the npa act is upheld and that cannot be in issue before us we may refer to the observation of < org > in < name > supra on behalf of the respondents it was urged that the cmm dm acting under section is performing a ministerial function and hence it is not necessary to give a hearing to the affected parties as he cannot determine the rights of the parties it was also argued that section gives finality to order passed by the cmm dm under section and therefore it is necessary to hear parties who are likely to be adversely affected by it we find no substance in this submission chief", "metropolitan magistrate or district magistrate to assist secured creditor in taking possession of secured asset for the purpose of securing compliance with the provisions of sub section the chief metropolitan magistrate of the district magistrate may take or cause to be taken such steps and use or cause to be used such force as may in his opinion be necessary no act of the chief metropolitan magistrate or the district magistrate done in pursuance of this section shall be called in question in any court or before any authority sub section grants immunity to the cmm dm as regards steps taken by him or force allowed to be used by him for providing assistance for taking possession since as stated by us adjudication of rival claims is absent at that stage there is no question of his dealing with rival claims and giving a reasoned judgment as

one of the key drivers in indias efforts to achieve success in rapidly developing its economy while the banking industry in india is progressively complying with the international prudential norms and accounting practices there are certain areas which the banking and financial sector do not have a level playing field as compared to other participants in the financial markets in the world there is no legal provision for facilitating securitisation of financial assets of banks and financial institutions further unlike international banks the banks and financial institutions in india do not have

been disposed of by separate orders we may briefly refer to the facts averred in criminal writ petition no of it appears that since the petitioners failed to repay the debt respondent issued a notice dated under section of the npa act and called upon the petitioners to pay sum of rs the case of the petitioners further is that respondent filed an application in < org > esplanade mumbai under section of the npa act praying for assistance to take possession of the said flat the petitioners have challenged the said order in this writ petition before we deal with the attack on the impugned order we must note that affidavit has been filed by petitioner reiterating that the notice sent by respondent under section of the npa act has been duly replied by the petitioners on affidavit in reply has been filed on behalf of respondent by mr < name > asstt mr < name > submitted that this section which speaks of the power of the chief metropolitan magistrate district magistrate for convenience the cmm dm to assist the secured creditor in taking possession of secured asset begins with the words where the possession of secured assets is required to be taken by the secured creditor mr < name > contended that it is implicit in this sentence that the cmm dm has to apply his mind as to whether possession is required to be taken or not there could be cases where after due application of mind it may appear to the cmm dm that it is not necessary to take possession mr < name > submitted that while exercising jurisdiction under section the cmm dm must see whether there is compliance of section a mr < name > contended that section a requires that if on receipt of the notice under sub section the borrower makes any representation or raises any objection the secured

within one week of receipt of such representation or objection the reasons for nonacceptance of the representation or objection to the borrower", "he pointed out that < org > has observed that the secured creditor must bear in mind the say of the borrower before process of recovery is initiated and so as to demonstrate that the reply of the borrower to the notice under section of the npa act has been considered applying mind to it the reasons however brief that may be for not accepting the objections if raised in the reply must be communicated to the borrower mr < name > pointed out that < org > has also expressed that while resorting to such legislation it would be necessary to see that the persons aggrieved get a fair deal at the hands of those who have been vested with the powers to enforce drastic steps to make recovery in that case it was argued that though the petitioner therein had filed objection to the notice under section of the npa act that objection was not considered by the secured creditor no reasoned reply was given to the secured creditor mr < name > then contended that section states that no act of the cmm dm in pursuance of this section shall be called in

it is true that the npa act is enacted keeping in view mounting levels of non performing assets of banks and financial institutions and for reducing non performing assets by adopting measures for

act constituting the tribunal it is really a decision on its own jurisdiction for the exercise of the power conferred by the statute or to perform the duties imposed by the statute < org > then observed that while exercising the power or performing the duty under section of the arbitration act the chief justice has to consider as to whether the conditions laid down by the section for the exercise of that power or for the performance of that duty exist and therefore while functioning under section of the arbitration act the chief justice or the person or institution designated by him is bound to decide whether he has jurisdiction whether there is an arbitration agreement whether the applicant before him is a party whether the conditions for exercise of the power have been fulfilled and if an arbitrator is to be appointed who is the fit person in terms of the provision < org > noted that section of the arbitration act makes his decision on the matters entrusted to him final mr < name > contended that in this case also the cmm dm has to decide whether the preliminary facts enabling him to exercise jurisdiction under section of the npa act exist he referred to order xxi rules and of the and contended that sale of the immoveable property in occupation of the judgment debtor takes place before taking possession mr < name > also referred to section which states that the secured creditor may require by notice in writing from any person who has acquired any of the secured assets from the borrower and from whom any money may become due to the borrower to pay him as much of the money as is sufficient to pay the secured debt he pointed out that under rule a the notice which the authorised officer has to serve on the borrower must include the description of the immoveable property to be sold including the details of the encumbrances known to the secured creditor in such cases the authorised officer may if he thinks fit allow the purchaser to deposit with him the money required to discharge the encumbrances under sub rule on such deposit for discharge of encumbrances the authorised officer may issue notice to the person entitled to the money deposited and take steps to make the payment accordingly and under sub rule the authorised officer shall deliver the property to the purchaser free from encumbrances he submitted that the legislature has used the

learned senior counsel pointed out that under section of the npa act no act of the cmm dm done in pursuance of section can be called in question in any court or before any authority section states that if drt on application made under section or < org > on an appeal preferred under section holds that the possession of secured assets by the secured creditor is not in accordance with the provisions of the npa act it can direct the secured creditor to return such secured assets to the concerned borrower and the concerned borrower shall be entitled to payment of compensation mr < name > contended that in < org > case supra < org > has in paragraph clearly stated that section of the npa act proceeds on the basis that the borrower who is under disability has failed to discharge his liability within the period prescribed under section which enables the secured creditor to take recourse to one or more of the measures namely taking possession of the secured assets including the right to transfer by way of lease assignment or sale for realising the secured assets mr < name > contended that there is no privity of contract between a third party and the secured creditor mr <

drt mr < name > submitted that the appeal provided in section is an illusory appeal < org > observed that even if a statute is silent and there are no positive words in the act or the rules made thereunder there could be nothing wrong in spelling out the need to hear the parties whose rights and interests are likely to be affected by the orders that may be passed and making it a requirement to follow a fair procedure before taking a decision unless the statutes provides otherwise mr < name > contended that this observation would apply with equal or more force to the judicial powers exercised by the cmm dm under section of the npa act where termination of the membership of members from the council was challenged on the ground that they were not given notice and they were not heard and therefore there was a violation of principles of natural justice this provision according to mr < name > is akin to such provisions found in the bombay police act the customs act and such other statutes it does not give finality to the actions but grants only immunity it should have power to give a definite judgment which has finality mr < name > also referred to the judgment of < org

interpret section in a manner which will further the object of the npa act rather than frustrate it mr < name > however accepted that in a given case of gross injustice this court can entertain a writ petition and give relief to the affected party mr < name > further submitted that the judgment in < org > scase supra has no application to the facts of the present case interest of the bank becomes

interest was created whether it became absolute or not whether it became non performing as per guidelines of < org > whether reply was given to the borrower etc mr < name > submitted that < org > who

and no injunction shall be granted by any court in respect of any action taken under the npa act and the < org > act mr < name > further submitted that section of the npa act gives overriding effect to its provisions mr < name > pointed out that section gives power to < org > to make rules there is no provision enabling < org > to make rules in respect of section that is because the cmm dm exercises ministerial power mr < name > then submitted that in < org > supra < org > has upheld the validity of the npa act mr < name > contended that the provisions of the npa act have to be interpreted keeping in mind its background and when there is conflict between law and equity it is the law which has to prevail mr < name > submitted that when alternative and efficacious remedy is provided under section the petitioner cannot invoke writ jurisdiction of this court where in the context of appeal provided under section of the drt act < org > has held that when remedy of appeal was available < org > should not have entertained the petition under article of the constitution of india in this judgment < org > has held that the < org > can even go beyond", "the < org > and only fetter that is put on its power is to observe principles of natural justice where the learned single judge has observed that the requirement of natural justice has been expressly provided under section of the npa act and once the rule of natural justice is followed by the procedure under section of the npa act no further notice is required to be given under section of the npa act mr < name > also placed heavy reliance on the judgment of < org > in < org > supra < org > observed that the employment of the said two monosyllables is of great jurisprudential import in the same clause dealing with two rights regarding the same burden must have two different imports mr < name > contended that applying this principle to sub section i of section while the secured creditor has an option to make a request to the cmm dm the cmm dm shall on such request being made to him take possession of the asset and for securing compliance he may cause force to be used mr < name > further contended that the submission that appeal provided under section is illusory has been dealt with by < org > in < org > supra mr < name > contended that there is enough indication in section a and explanation to section that a third party has no right at the stage of section a that is at the stage of communication of reasons to the borrower to make an application to the drt under sub section of section while section a gives a right only to the borrower to raise an objection and states that the secured creditor has to consider the objection within one week and communicate the non acceptance if any to the borrower the proviso to sub section a says that the communication of reason shall not confer on the borrower a right to prefer an application to drt under section at the stage of communication of reasons section gives a right of appeal to any person including borrower explanation states that at the stage of communication of reasons the person including the borrower shall not be entitled to make an application to drt under sub section of section < name > the learned counsel appearing for the respondent bank in criminal writ petition no of adopted the submissions advanced on behalf of the

respondent in writ petition no of adopted the arguments of the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners mr < name > and mr < name > who appear for respondent in criminal writ petition no of have submitted written submissions though in < org >", "case supra < org > was considering whether withdrawal of a in terms of the first proviso to section of the drt act is a condition precedent to taking recourse to the npa act while dealing with this question < org > observed that three points arise for determination out of the those three points the point which is relevant for the present case is as follows whether recourse to take possession of the secured assets of the borrower in terms of section of the npa act comprehends the power to take actual possession of the immoveable property the npa act enables the banks and financial institutions to realise long term assets manage problems of liquidity asset liability mis match and to improve recovery of debts by exercising powers to take possession of securities sell them and thereby reduce non performing assets by adopting measures for recovery and reconstruction the npa act further provides for setting up of asset reconstruction companies which are empowered to take possession of secured assets of the borrower including the right to transfer by way of lease assignment or sale a the drt act did not provide for assignment of debts to securitisation companies the secured assets could not be liquidated in time the npa act was enacted to reduce mounting non performing assets by empowering banks to liquidate the assets and secured interest the npa act deals with crystallized liabilities the npa act proceeds on the basis that the asset is created in favour of bank which could be assigned to the assets management company which steps into the shoes of the secured creditors section proceeds on the basis that the borrower is under a liability and his account in the books of account of the bank is classified as sub standard or doubtful or loss the npa act comes into force only if these two conditions are satisfied since section deals with liquidation of liability on the basis that the account of the borrower has become non performing there is no scope of any dispute regarding liability the npa act does not deal with disputes between the secured creditors and the borrowers but it deals with the rights of the secured creditors interse section and section of the npa act proceed on the basis that the security interest in the bank and financial institution needs to be enforced expeditiously without the intervention of the < org > and that enforcement could take place by non adjudicatory process the npa act provides for recovery of possession by non adjudicatory process the npa act removes all fetters on the right of the secured creditor i under section the < org > is required to consider whether any of the measures referred to in section are in accordance with the provisions of the npa act and the rules made thereunder if while examining the application under section the drt comes to the", "conclusion that any of the measures taken under section are not in accordance with npa act it shall direct the secured creditor to restore the possession to the borrower or restore management to the borrower if the < org > declares that the recourse taken under section is in accordance with the provisions of the npa act then notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force the secured creditor shall be entitled to take recourse to anyone or more of the measures as specified under section to recover his secured debt section shows that the secured creditor is free to take recourse to any one of the measures under section notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force for the sake of argument if in a given case the measures undertaken by the secured creditor under section come in conflict with the < org > land revenue law then notwithstanding such conflict the provision of section shall override the local law this position stands clarified by section of the npa act which states that the provisions of the npa act shall override all other laws which are inconsistent with the npa act section gives an overriding effect to the npa act over all other laws if they are in consistent with it the dichotomy between symbolic and physical possession does not find place in the npa act rule of the said rules deals with the sale of immoveable secured assets rule deals with the stage anterior to the issuance of sale certificate and delivery of possession under rule rule relates to time of sale issue of sale certificate and delivery of possession the court receiver can take symbolic possession and in appropriate cases he can take actual possession even prior to the decree the authorised officer powers are greater as security interest is already created in the bank hence under rule he can take steps to preserve the secured asset till issuance of the sale certificate under rule rule states that on confirmation of sale if the terms of payment are complied with the authorised officer shall issue a sale certificate in favour of the purchaser rule states that the authorised officer shall deliver the property to the buyer free from all encumbrances known to the secured creditor or not known to the secured creditor this scheme of the npa act therefore does not disclose any dichotomy between symbolic possession and physical possession since scheme of section read with section shows that if the borrower is dispossessed not in accordance with the provisions of the npa act the drt is entitled to restore status quo ante it cannot be said that if possession is taken before confirmation of sale the rights of the borrower to get the dispute adjudicated upon is defeated by the authorised officer taking possession the disputes which are sought to be avoided by rule read with rule of", "the said rules are those where third party interests are created overnight and in very many cases those third parties take up the defence of being a bonafide purchaser for value without notice if any reply is submitted by the borrower the bank has to consider it and if it does not accept it it has to communicate the reasons to the borrower there is no scope for any dispute regarding liability section and proceed on the basis that the security interest in the bank and financial institution needs to be enforced expeditiously without intervention of the court by non adjudicatory process till application under section is made there is no adjudication of any kind if possession is given without resistance there is no need of approaching the cmm dm under section the argument that taking physical possession of secured asset is not contemplated under the npa act must be rejected in view of the clear observation of < org > in < org > case that the dichotomy between symbolic and physical possession does not find place in the npa act similarly when the secured creditor approaches < org > for assistance to take possession of the secured asset the liability having been crystallized there can be no adjudication about it at that stage there is no question of pointing out to < org > at that stage that the person who is to be dispossessed is a tenant or that he has a prior registered sale deed or that in case of simple mortgage ownership rights are not transferred that the mortgagee is only entitled to an obligation to pay and hence possession cannot be taken or that such a course will improve or change the contract etc grievance that reasons for not accepting the objections were not communicated can also not be raised at that stage because consideration of reply is in the realm of adjudication which cannot be done under section besides as per proviso to section a and explanation to section non communication of reasons to the borrower does not confer on the borrower or any person right to prefer an application under section at the stage of communication remedy is provided in section where appropriate relief can be given to them in any case it is also held by < org > in < org > case supra that if the measures undertaken by the secured creditor come in conflict with any other law the provisions of section override these provisions and that section gives an overriding effect to the npa act we also find no substance in the submission that remedy of appeal application provided under section of the npa act is illusory in this connection we may usefully refer to the judgment of < org > in < org > supra the argument that it will not be possible to produce any documents there that there objection", "can be taken only to procedural irregularities about measures taken under section must also be rejected in this connection we may also refer to the judgment of < org > in < org > case supra in that case < org > has after referring to its earlier judgment reiterated that the < org > can travel beyond the < org > and the only fetter that is put on its powers is to observe the principles of natural justice < org > has further observed that the < org > can pass orders to secure the ends of justice it is also not possible for us to hold that remedy provided under section is not available to a third party this section begins with the words any person including borrower aggrieved by any of the measures referred to in sub section of section in our opinion the words any person including borrower cover third parties also under section a the secured creditor is required to communicate to the borrower reasons for not accepting his objection to the notice under section but the reasons so communicated does not confer any right on the borrower to make an application before the < org > under section explanation to section states that communication of reasons to the borrower does not entitle the person including borrower to make an application to < org > under section at the stage of communication < name > the learned counsel appearing for the respondent bank has drawn our attention to the judgments of the < org > where rights of third parties are dealt with and relief is granted to them there is also no substance in the submission that no relief can be given to a third party because section speaks only of restoration of possession of the secured asset to the borrower section states that if the < org > comes to the conclusion that any of the measures stated in section taken by the secured creditor are not in accordance with the npa act and the rules made thereunder it can restore possession of the secured assets to the borrower or restore the management of the secured asset to the borrower section further goes on to say that < org > can pass such order as it may consider appropriate and necessary in relation to any of the recourse taken by the secured creditor under sub section of section therefore there is no reason to conclude that no orders can be passed in respect of third parties by < org > under section section which provides for appeal to < org > also states that any person aggrieved by any order made by < org > under section may prefer an appeal to an < org > there is no provision under the npa act putting fetters on the drts powers particularly when in < or", "##g > case supra < org > has held that it can travel beyond the < org > and it can pass orders to secure ends of justice there is no doubt that a party who is likely to be adversely affected by any action must be given a hearing before the action is taken it proceeds on the basis that liability of the borrower is crystallized in our opinion to secure its object the npa act has by necessary implication ruled out giving hearing either to the borrower or third parties till the application is filed under section as observed by < org > in transcore scase supra section of the npa act inter alia states that the bank or financial institution may if it considers appropriate give a notice of acquisition of financial assets by any securitisation company or reconstruction company to the borrower and to any other concerned person but they may or may not give notice to the borrower regarding acquisition of financial assets the reason being that assets are transferable overnight section a requires the secured creditor to communicate to the borrower reasons for not accepting his representation or objection and proviso thereto states that such communication shall not confer right on the borrower to make an application under section at that stage section with which we are concerned here does not contemplate any notice to the borrower or a third party it is only section which states that any person including borrower can make an application to < org > being aggrieved by any measure taken under section explanation to section clarifies that reasons communicated to a borrower at the stage of communication will not confer on the person including borrower any right to make an application to < org > under section section again confers right on any person aggrieved by an order of < org > under section to file an appeal before < org > against the said order nothing prevented the legislature from specifically making a provision in section for notice to the borrower or third party it purposely did not make provision for notice or hearing being given to the borrower or third party at the stage of section though the validity fo the npa act is upheld and that cannot be in issue before us we may refer to the observation of < org > in < name > supra on behalf of the respondents it was urged that the cmm dm acting under section is performing a ministerial function and hence it is not necessary to give a hearing to the affected parties as he cannot determine the rights of the parties it was also argued that section gives finality to order passed by the cmm dm under section and therefore it is necessary to hear parties who are likely to be adversely affected by it we find no substance in this submission chief", "metropolitan magistrate or district magistrate to assist secured creditor in taking possession of secured asset for the purpose of securing compliance with the provisions of sub section the chief metropolitan magistrate of the district magistrate may take or cause to be taken such steps and use or cause to be used such force as may in his opinion be necessary no act of the chief metropolitan magistrate or the district magistrate done in pursuance of this section shall be called in question in any court or before any authority sub section grants immunity to the cmm dm as regards steps taken by him or force allowed to be used by him for providing assistance for taking possession since as stated by us adjudication of rival claims is absent at that stage there is no question of his dealing with rival claims and giving a reasoned judgment as regards the merits of the case and obviously there is no question of such a reasoning assuming finality we must also refer to the judgment of < org > in < org > scase supra on which reliance is placed by mr < name > in that case while considering the nature of the power exercised by the chief justices of < org > or chief justice of india under section of the arbitration act < org > held that any tribunal conferred with a power to act under a statute has a jurisdiction to satisfy itself whether the conditions for exercise of power existed the chief justice or the person designated by him is bound to decide whether he has jurisdiction whether there is arbitration agreement whether the conditions for the exercise of powers have been fulfilled and if an arbitrator is appointed whether he is a fit person in fact in < org > scase supra < org > has clearly stated that while exercising the power under section of the arbitration act the chief justice has to consider whether the conditions

also consider before approaching < org > for an order under section of the npa act whether section of the npa act excludes the application of sections and thereof to the case on hand cmm dm acting under section of the npa act is not required to give notice either to the borrower or to the rd party he has to only verify from the bank or financial institution whether notice under section of the

an order under section of the npa act by recording that the above conditions are not fulfilled if these two conditions are fulfilled he cannot refuse to pass an order under section remedy provided under section of the npa act is available to the borrower as well as the third party remedy provided under section is an efficacious alternative remedy available to the third party as well as to the

learned cjm aurangabad was completely on wrong foot in observing that the assistance cannot be sought unless there is a decree in favour the secured creditor chief metropolit", "qid": 2, "doc": ["[CLS] the question which arises in these writ petitions is whether while dealing with a written request made by a secured creditor under section of the securitisation and reconstruction of financial assets and enforcement of security interest act for short the npa act the chief judicial magistrate or the district magistrate as the case may be is required to give notice to the borrower or any person who may be in possession of secured asset and give him a hearing we have also heard mr < name > the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners in criminal writ petition no of we have heard them on their request though the petitions in which they are appearing have been disposed of by separate orders we may briefly refer to the facts averred in criminal writ petition no of it appears that since the petitioners failed to repay the debt respondent issued a notice dated under section of the npa act and called upon the petitioners to pay sum of rs the case of the petitioners further is that respondent filed an application in < org > esplanade mumbai under section of the npa act praying for assistance to take possession of the said flat the petitioners have challenged the said order in this writ petition before we deal with the attack on the impugned order we must note that affidavit has been filed by petitioner reiterating that the notice sent by respondent under section of the npa act has been duly replied by the petitioners on affidavit in reply has been filed on behalf of respondent by mr < name > asstt mr < name > submitted that this section which speaks of the power of the chief metropolitan magistrate district magistrate for convenience the cmm dm to assist the secured creditor in taking possession of secured asset begins with the words where the possession of secured assets is required to be taken by the secured creditor mr < name > contended that it is implicit in this sentence that the cmm dm has to apply his mind as to whether possession is required to be taken or not there could be cases where after due application of mind it may appear to the cmm dm that it is not necessary to take possession mr < name > submitted that while exercising jurisdiction under section the cmm dm must see whether there is compliance of section a mr < name > contended that section a requires that if on receipt of the notice under sub section the borrower makes any representation or raises any objection the secured creditor shall consider such representation or objection and if the secured creditor comes to the conclusion that such representation or objection is not acceptable or tenable he shall communicate within one week of receipt of such representation or objection the reasons for nonacceptance of the representation or objection to the borrower", "he pointed out that < org > has observed that the secured creditor must bear in mind the say of the borrower before process of recovery is initiated and so as to demonstrate that the reply of the borrower to the notice under section of the npa act has been considered applying mind to it the reasons however brief that may be for not accepting the objections if raised in the reply must be communicated to the borrower mr < name > pointed out that < org > has also expressed that while resorting to such legislation it would be necessary to see that the persons aggrieved get a fair deal at the hands of those who have been vested with the powers to enforce drastic steps to make recovery in that case it was argued that though the petitioner therein had filed objection to the notice under section of the npa act that objection was not considered by the secured creditor no reasoned reply was given to the secured creditor mr < name > then contended that section states that no act of the cmm dm in pursuance of this section shall be called in question in any court or before any authority remedy of appeal is provided in section against measures in section it is not an appeal against power exercised under section mr < name > contended that it is true that the npa act is enacted keeping in view mounting levels of non performing assets of banks and financial institutions and for reducing non performing assets by adopting measures for recovery and reconstruction at any rate he is exercising quasi judicial powers therefore notice has to be read in section mr < name > contended that proceedings contemplated under section are original proceedings hence hearing provided under section assuming objections can be raised to order passed under section therein is not sufficient hearing must be given while ordering possession being taken under section if it is held to be not a judicial power it is at least a quasi judicial power and therefore application of mind to the material questions such as as to whether the asset is secured or not whether there is a simple mortgage or not whether the tenant is lawful or not etc in that case < org > was considering the nature of power exercised by the chief justices of < org > or the chief justice of india under section of the arbitration and conciliation act for short the arbitration act mr <

conditions for the exercise of that power existed and that the case calls for the exercise of that power < org > observed that such an adjudication relating to its own jurisdiction which", "could be called as decision on jurisdictional facts is not generally final unless it is made so by the act constituting the tribunal it is really a decision on its own jurisdiction for the exercise of the power conferred by the statute or to perform the duties imposed by the statute < org > then observed that while exercising the power or performing the duty under section of the arbitration act the chief justice has to consider as to whether the conditions laid down by the section for the exercise of that power or for the performance of that duty exist and therefore while functioning under section of the arbitration act the chief justice or the person or institution designated by him is bound to decide whether he has jurisdiction whether there is an arbitration agreement whether the applicant before him is a party whether the conditions for exercise of the power have been fulfilled and if an arbitrator is to be appointed who is the fit person in terms of the provision < org > noted that section of the arbitration act makes his decision on the matters entrusted to him final mr < name > contended that in this case also the cmm dm has to decide whether the preliminary facts enabling him to exercise jurisdiction under section of the npa act exist he referred to order xxi rules and of the and contended that sale of the immoveable property in occupation of the judgment debtor takes place before taking possession mr < name > also referred to section which states that the secured creditor may require by notice in writing from any person who has acquired any of the secured assets from the borrower and from whom any money may become due to the borrower to pay him as much of the money as is sufficient to pay the secured debt he pointed out that under rule a the notice which the authorised officer has to serve on the borrower must include the description of the immoveable property to be sold including the details of the encumbrances known to the secured creditor in such cases the authorised officer may if he thinks fit allow the purchaser to deposit with him the money required to discharge the encumbrances under sub rule on such deposit for discharge of encumbrances the authorised officer may issue notice to the person entitled to the money deposited and take steps to make the payment accordingly and under sub rule the authorised officer shall deliver the property to the purchaser free from encumbrances he submitted that the legislature has used the word shall in rule he must inter alia find out whether there is a valid and subsisting mortgage which is not simple or equitable mortgage whether the secured creditor requires the possession or not etc mr < name > submitted that in the circumstances this < org > should direct the < org

in pursuance of section can be called in question in any court or before any authority section states that if drt on application made under section or < org > on an appeal preferred under section holds that the possession of secured assets by the secured creditor is not in accordance with the provisions of the npa act it can direct the secured creditor to return such secured assets to the concerned borrower and the concerned borrower shall be entitled to payment of compensation mr < name > contended that in < org > case supra < org > has in paragraph clearly stated that section of the npa act proceeds on the basis that the borrower who is under disability has failed to discharge his liability within the period prescribed under section which enables the secured creditor to take recourse to one or more of the measures namely taking possession of the secured assets including the right to transfer by way of lease assignment or sale for realising the secured assets mr < name > contended that there is no privity of contract between a third party and the secured creditor mr < name > submitted that under section any person including a borrower aggrieved by any of the measures referred to in sub section of section taken by the secured creditor may make an application to the drt mr < name > submitted that the appeal provided in section is an illusory appeal < org > observed that even if a statute is silent and there are no positive words in the act or the rules made thereunder there could be nothing wrong in spelling out the need to hear the parties whose rights and interests are likely to be affected by the orders that may be passed and making it a requirement to follow a fair procedure before taking a decision unless the statutes provides otherwise mr < name > contended that this observation would apply with equal or more force to the judicial powers exercised by the cmm dm under section of the npa act where termination of the membership of members from the council was challenged on the ground that they were not given notice and they were not heard and therefore there was a violation of principles of natural justice this provision according to mr < name > is akin to such provisions found in the bombay police act the customs act and such other statutes it does not give finality to the actions but grants only immunity it should have power to give a definite judgment which has finality mr < name > also referred to the judgment of < org > in < org > supra for highlight", "##ing the object of the npa act mr < name > submitted that the legislature has on purpose excluded hearing to the borrower or third parties and this < org > should interpret section in a manner which will further the object of the npa act rather than frustrate it mr < name > however accepted that in a given case of gross injustice this court can entertain a writ petition and give relief to the affected party mr < name > further submitted that the judgment in < org > scase supra has no application to the facts of the present case interest of the bank becomes absolute once there is a default committed by the borrower the learned counsel contended that there is no adjudication provided in the npa act upto section in that the < org > considers whether interest was created whether it became absolute or not whether it became non performing as per guidelines of < org > whether reply was given to the borrower etc mr < name > submitted that < org > who deals with these appeals has wide powers under section of the < org > act and therefore all questions can be considered in the appeal he submitted that section merely gives immunity to < org > mr < name > submitted that under section no civil court shall have jurisdiction to entertain any proceedings in respect of any matter which < org > or < org > is empowered to determine under the npa act and no injunction shall be granted by any court in respect of any action taken under the npa act and the < org > act mr < name > further submitted that section of the npa act gives overriding effect to its provisions mr < name > pointed out that section gives power to < org > to make rules there is no provision enabling < org > to make rules in respect of section that is because the cmm dm exercises ministerial power mr < name > then submitted that in < org > supra < org > has upheld the validity of the npa act mr < name > contended that the provisions of the npa act have to be interpreted keeping in mind its background and when there is conflict between law and equity it is the law which has to prevail mr < name > submitted that when alternative and efficacious remedy is provided under section the petitioner cannot invoke writ jurisdiction of this court where in the context of appeal provided under section of the drt act < org > has held that when remedy of appeal was available < org > should not have entertained the petition under article of the constitution of india in this judgment < org > has held that the < org > can even go beyond", "the < org > and only fetter that is put on its power is to observe principles of natural justice where the learned single judge has observed that the requirement of natural justice has been expressly provided under section of the npa act and once the rule of natural justice is followed by the procedure under section of the npa act no further notice is required to be given under section of the npa act mr < name > also placed heavy reliance on the judgment of < org > in < org > supra < org > observed that the employment of the said two monosyllables is of great jurisprudential import in the same clause dealing with two rights regarding the same burden must have two different imports mr < name > contended that applying this principle to sub section i of section while the secured creditor has an option to make a request to the cmm dm the cmm dm shall on such request being made to him take possession of the asset and for securing compliance he may cause force to be used mr < name > further contended that the submission that appeal provided under section is illusory has been dealt with by < org > in < org > supra mr < name > contended that there is enough indication in section a and explanation to section that a third party has no right at the stage of section a that is at the stage of communication of reasons to the borrower to make an application to the drt under sub section of section while section a gives a right only to the borrower to raise an objection and states that the secured creditor has to consider the objection within one week and communicate the non acceptance if any to the borrower the proviso to sub section a says that the communication of reason shall not confer on the borrower a right to prefer an application to drt under section at the stage of communication of reasons section gives a right of appeal to any person including borrower explanation states that at the stage of communication of reasons the person including the borrower shall not be entitled to make an application to drt under sub section of section < name > the learned counsel appearing for the respondent bank in criminal writ petition no of adopted the submissions advanced on behalf of the petitioners the learned counsel drew our attention to judgments of the < org > where such appeals are entertained and in some cases relief is also given mr < name > the learned counsel appearing for respondent in writ petition no of adopted the arguments of the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners mr < name > and mr < name > who appear for respondent in criminal writ petition no of have submitted written submissions though in < org >", "case supra < org > was considering whether withdrawal of a in terms of the first proviso to section of the drt act is a condition precedent to taking recourse to the npa act while dealing with this question < org > observed that three points arise for determination out of the those three points the point which is relevant for the present case is as follows whether recourse to take possession of the secured assets of the borrower in terms of section of the npa act comprehends the power to take actual possession of the immoveable property the npa act enables the banks and financial institutions to realise long term assets manage problems of liquidity asset liability mis match and to improve recovery of debts by exercising powers to take possession of securities sell them and thereby reduce non performing assets by adopting measures for recovery and reconstruction the npa act further provides for setting up of asset reconstruction companies which are empowered to take possession of secured assets of the borrower including the right to transfer by way of lease assignment or sale a the drt act did not provide for assignment of debts to securitisation companies the secured assets could not be liquidated in time the npa act was enacted to reduce mounting non performing assets by empowering banks to liquidate the assets and secured interest the npa act deals with crystallized liabilities the npa act proceeds on the basis that the asset is created in favour of bank which could be assigned to the assets management company which steps into the shoes of the secured creditors section proceeds on the basis that the borrower is under a liability and his account in the books of account of the bank is classified as sub standard or doubtful or loss the npa act comes into force only if these two conditions are satisfied since section deals with liquidation of liability on the basis that the account of the borrower has become non performing there is no scope of any dispute regarding liability the npa act does not deal with disputes between the secured creditors and the borrowers but it deals with the rights of the secured creditors interse section and section of the npa act proceed on the basis that the security interest in the bank and financial institution needs to be enforced expeditiously without the intervention of the < org > and that enforcement could take place by non adjudicatory process the npa act provides for recovery of possession by non adjudicatory process the npa act removes all fetters on the right of the secured creditor i under section the < org > is required to consider whether any of the measures referred to in section are in accordance with the provisions of the npa act and the rules made thereunder if while examining the application under section the drt comes to the", "conclusion that any of the measures taken under section are not in accordance with npa act it shall direct the secured creditor to restore the possession to the borrower or restore management to the borrower if the < org > declares that the recourse taken under section is in accordance with the provisions of the npa act then notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force the secured creditor shall be entitled to take recourse to anyone or more of the measures as specified under section to recover his secured debt section shows that the secured creditor is free to take recourse to any one of the measures under section notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force for the sake of argument if in a given case the measures undertaken by the secured creditor under section come in conflict with the < org > land revenue law then notwithstanding such conflict the provision of section shall override the local law this position stands clarified by section of the npa act which states that the provisions of the npa act shall override all other laws which are inconsistent with the npa act section gives an overriding effect to the npa act over all other laws if they are in consistent with it the dichotomy between symbolic and physical possession does not find place in the npa act rule of the said rules deals with the sale of immoveable secured assets rule deals with the stage anterior to the issuance of sale certificate and delivery of possession under rule rule relates to time of sale issue of sale certificate and delivery of possession the court receiver can take symbolic possession and in appropriate cases he can take actual possession even prior to the decree the authorised officer powers are greater as security interest is already created in the bank hence under rule he can take steps to preserve the secured asset till issuance of the sale certificate under rule rule states that on confirmation of sale if the terms of payment are complied with the authorised officer shall issue a sale certificate in favour of the purchaser rule states that the authorised officer shall deliver the property to the buyer free from all encumbrances known to the secured creditor or not known to the secured creditor this scheme of the npa act therefore does not disclose any dichotomy between symbolic possession and physical possession since scheme of section read with section shows that if the borrower is dispossessed not in accordance with the provisions of the npa act the drt is entitled to restore status quo ante it cannot be said that if possession is taken before confirmation of sale the rights of the borrower to get the dispute adjudicated upon is defeated by the authorised officer taking possession the disputes which are sought to be avoided by rule read with rule of", "the said rules are those where third party interests are created overnight and in very many cases those third parties take up the defence of being a bonafide purchaser for value without notice if any reply is submitted by the borrower the bank has to consider it and if it does not accept it it has to communicate the reasons to the borrower there is no scope for any dispute regarding liability section and proceed on the basis that the security interest in the bank and financial institution needs to be enforced expeditiously without intervention of the court by non adjudicatory process till application under section is made there is no adjudication of any kind if possession is given without resistance there is no need of approaching the cmm dm under section the argument that taking physical possession of secured asset is not contemplated under the npa act must be rejected in view of the clear observation of < org > in < org > case that the dichotomy between symbolic and physical possession does not find place in the npa act similarly when the secured creditor approaches < org > for assistance to take possession of the secured asset the liability having been crystallized there can be no adjudication about it at that stage there is no question of pointing out to < org > at that stage that the person who is to be dispossessed is a tenant or that he has a prior registered sale deed or that in case of simple mortgage ownership rights are not transferred that the mortgagee is only entitled to an obligation to pay and hence possession cannot be taken or that such a course will improve or change the contract etc grievance that reasons for not accepting the objections were not communicated can also not be raised at that stage because consideration of reply is in the realm of adjudication which cannot be done under section besides as per proviso to section a and explanation to section non communication of reasons to the borrower does not confer on the borrower or any person right to prefer an application under section at the stage of communication remedy is provided in section where appropriate relief can be given to them in any case it is also held by < org > in < org > case supra that if the measures undertaken by the secured creditor come in conflict with any other law the provisions of section override these provisions and that section gives an overriding effect to the npa act we also find no substance in the submission that remedy of appeal application provided under section of the npa act is illusory in this connection we may usefully refer to the judgment of < org > in < org > supra the argument that it will not be possible to produce any documents there that there objection", "can be taken only to procedural irregularities about measures taken under section must also be rejected in this connection we may also refer to the judgment of < org > in < org > case supra in that case < org > has after referring to its earlier judgment reiterated that the < org > can travel beyond the < org > and the only fetter that is put on its powers is to observe the principles of natural justice < org > has further observed that the < org > can pass orders to secure the ends of justice it is also not possible for us to hold that remedy provided under section is not available to a third party this section begins with the words any person including borrower aggrieved by any of the measures referred to in sub section of section in our opinion the words any person including borrower cover third parties also under section a the secured creditor is required to communicate to the borrower reasons for not accepting his objection to the notice under section but the reasons so communicated does not confer any right on the borrower to make an application before the < org > under section explanation to section states that communication of reasons to the borrower does not entitle the person including borrower to make an application to < org > under section at the stage of communication < name > the learned counsel appearing for the respondent bank has drawn our attention to the judgments of the < org > where rights of third parties are dealt with and relief is granted to them there is also no substance in the submission that no relief can be given to a third party because section speaks only of restoration of possession of the secured asset to the borrower section states that if the < org > comes to the conclusion that any of the measures stated in section taken by the secured creditor are not in accordance with the npa act and the rules made thereunder it can restore possession of the secured assets to the borrower or restore the management of the secured asset to the borrower section further goes on to say that < org > can pass such order as it may consider appropriate and necessary in relation to any of the recourse taken by the secured creditor under sub section of section therefore there is no reason to conclude that no orders can be passed in respect of third parties by < org > under section section which provides for appeal to < org > also states that any person aggrieved by any order made by < org > under section may prefer an appeal to an < org > there is no provision under the npa act putting fetters on the drts powers particularly when in < or", "##g > case supra < org > has held that it can travel beyond the < org > and it can pass orders to secure ends of justice there is no doubt that a party who is likely to be adversely affected by any action must be given a hearing before the action is taken it proceeds on the basis that liability of the borrower is crystallized in our opinion to secure its object the npa act has by necessary implication ruled out giving hearing either to the borrower or third parties till the application is filed under section as observed by < org > in transcore scase supra section of the npa act inter alia states that the bank or financial institution may if it considers appropriate give a notice of acquisition of financial assets by any securitisation company or reconstruction company to the borrower and to any other concerned person but they may or may not give notice to the borrower regarding acquisition of financial assets the reason being that assets are transferable overnight section a requires the secured creditor to communicate to the borrower reasons for not accepting his representation or objection and proviso thereto states that such communication shall not confer right on the borrower to make an application under section at that stage section with which we are concerned here does not contemplate any notice to the borrower or a third party it is only section which states that any person including borrower can make an application to < org > being aggrieved by any measure taken under section explanation to section clarifies that reasons communicated to a borrower at the stage of communication will not confer on the person including borrower any right to make an application to < org > under section section again confers right on any person aggrieved by an order of < org > under section to file an appeal before < org > against the said order nothing prevented the legislature from specifically making a provision in section for notice to the borrower or third party it purposely did not make provision for notice or hearing being given to the borrower or third party at the stage of section though the validity fo the npa act is upheld and that cannot be in issue before us we may refer to the observation of < org > in < name > supra on behalf of the respondents it was urged that the cmm dm acting under section is performing a ministerial function and hence it is not necessary to give a hearing to the affected parties as he cannot determine the rights of the parties it was also argued that section gives finality to order passed by the cmm dm under section and therefore it is necessary to hear parties who are likely to be adversely affected by it we find no substance in this submission chief", "metropolitan magistrate or district magistrate to assist secured creditor in taking possession of secured asset for the purpose of securing compliance with the provisions of sub section the chief metropolitan magistrate of the district magistrate may take or cause to be taken such steps and use or cause to be used such force as may in his opinion be necessary no act of the chief metropolitan magistrate or the district magistrate done in pursuance of this section shall be called in question in any court or before any authority sub section grants immunity to the cmm dm as regards steps taken by him or force allowed to be used by him for providing assistance for taking possession since as stated by us adjudication of rival claims is absent at that stage there is no question of his dealing with rival claims and giving a reasoned judgment as regards the merits of the case and obviously there is no question of such a reasoning assuming finality we must also refer to the judgment of < org > in < org > scase supra on which reliance is placed by mr < name > in that case while considering the nature of the power exercised by the chief justices of < org > or chief justice of india under section of the arbitration act < org > held that any tribunal conferred with a power to act under a statute has a jurisdiction to satisfy itself whether the conditions for exercise of power existed the chief justice or the person designated by him is bound to decide whether he has jurisdiction whether there is arbitration agreement whether the conditions for the exercise of powers have been fulfilled and if an arbitrator is appointed whether he is a fit person in fact in < org > scase supra < org > has clearly stated that while exercising the power under section of the arbitration act the chief justice has to consider whether the conditions laid down by the section exist or not in our opinion at the time of passing order under section of the npa act the cmm dm will have to consider only two aspects he must find out whether the secured asset falls within his territorial jurisdiction and whether notice under section of npa act is given or not on the other hand the learned counsel for the petitioners contended that there are no fetters on the powers of this court conferred upon it by articles and of the constitution of india and though alternative remedy is available if by the time the party avails of it great hardship and injustice is likely to be caused in a given case this court can

praying for assistance to take possession of the said flat the petitioners have challenged the said order in this writ petition before we deal with the attack on the impugned order we must note that

that it is implicit in this sentence that the cmm dm has to apply his mind as to whether possession is required to be taken or not there could be cases where after due application of mind it may appear to the cmm dm that it is not necessary to take possession mr < name > submitted that while exercising jurisdiction under section the cmm dm must see whether there is compliance of section a mr

representation or objection and if the secured creditor comes to the conclusion that such representation or objection is not acceptable or tenable he shall communicate within one week of receipt of

mind to it the reasons however brief that may be for not accepting the objections if raised in the reply must be communicated to the borrower mr < name > pointed out that < org > has also expressed that while resorting to such legislation it would be necessary to see that the persons aggrieved get a fair deal at the hands of those who have been vested with the powers to enforce drastic steps to

reasoned reply was given to the secured creditor mr < name > then contended that section states that no act of the cmm dm in pursuance of this section shall be called in question in any court or before any authority remedy of appeal is provided in section against measures in section it is not an appeal against power exercised under section mr < name > contended that it is true that the npa

at any rate he is exercising quasi judicial powers therefore notice has to be read in section mr < name > contended that proceedings contemplated under section are original proceedings hence hearing

power or performing the duty under section of the arbitration act the chief justice has to consider as to whether the conditions laid down by the section for the exercise of that power or for the performance of that duty exist and therefore while functioning under section of the arbitration act the chief justice or the person or institution designated by him is bound to decide whether he has jurisdiction whether there is an arbitration agreement whether the applicant before him is a party whether the conditions for exercise of the power have been fulfilled and if an arbitrator is to be appointed who is the fit person in terms of the provision < org > noted that section of the arbitration act makes his decision on the matters entrusted to him final mr < name > contended that in this

notice in writing from any person who has acquired any of the secured assets from the borrower and from whom any money may become due to the borrower to pay him as much of the money as is sufficient to pay the secured debt he pointed out that under rule a the notice which the authorised officer has to serve on the borrower must include the description of the immoveable property to be sold including the details of the encumbrances known to the secured creditor in such cases the authorised officer may if he thinks fit allow the purchaser to deposit with him the money required to discharge the encumbrances under sub rule on such deposit for discharge of encumbrances the authorised officer may issue notice to the person entitled to the money deposited and take steps to make the

must inter alia find out whether there is a valid and subsisting mortgage which is not simple or equitable mortgage whether the secured creditor requires the possession or not etc mr < name > submitted that in the circumstances this < org > should direct the < org > dm to give hearing to", "the persons who will be affected by his order and dispossessed mr < name > the learned senior

period prescribed under section which enables the secured creditor to take recourse to one or more of the measures namely taking possession of the secured assets including the right to transfer by way of lease assignment or sale for realising the secured assets mr < name > contended that there is no privity of contract between a third party and the secured creditor mr < name > submitted that under

that the appeal provided in section is an illusory appeal < org > observed that even if a statute is silent and there are no positive words in the act or the rules made thereunder there could be nothing wrong in spelling out the need to hear the parties whose rights and interests are likely to be affected by the orders that may be passed and making it a requirement to follow a fair procedure before taking a decision unless the statutes provides otherwise mr < name > contended that this observation would apply with equal or more force to the judicial powers exercised by the cmm dm under section of the npa act where termination of the membership of members from the council was challenged on the ground that they were not given notice and they were not heard and therefore there was a violation of principles of natural justice this provision according to mr < name > is akin to such provisions found in the bombay police act the customs act and such other statutes it does not give finality to the actions but grants only immunity it should have power to give a definite judgment which has finality mr < name > also referred to the judgment of < org > in < org > supra for

manner which will further the object of the npa act rather than frustrate it mr < name > however accepted that in a given case of gross injustice this court can entertain a writ petition and give relief to the affected party mr < name > further submitted that the judgment in < org > scase supra has no application to the facts of the present case interest of the bank becomes absolute once there is a default committed by the borrower the learned counsel contended that there is no adjudication provided in the npa act upto section in that the < org > considers whether interest was created whether it became absolute or not whether it became non performing as per guidelines of < org > whether reply was given to the borrower etc mr < name > submitted that < org > who deals with these appeals has wide powers under section of the < org > act and therefore all questions can be considered in the appeal he submitted that section merely gives immunity to < org > mr < name > submitted that under section no civil court shall have jurisdiction to entertain any proceedings in respect of any matter which < org > or < org > is empowered to determine under the npa act and no injunction shall be granted by any court in respect of any action taken under the npa act and the < org > act mr < name > further submitted that section of the npa act gives overriding effect to its provisions mr < name > pointed out that section gives power to < org > to make rules there is no provision enabling < org > to make rules in respect of section that is because the cmm dm exercises ministerial power mr < name > then submitted that in < org > supra < org > has upheld the validity of the npa act mr < name > contended that the provisions of the npa act have to be interpreted keeping in mind its background and when there is conflict between law and equity it is the law which has to prevail mr < name > submitted that when alternative and efficacious remedy is provided under section the petitioner cannot invoke writ jurisdiction of this court where in the context of appeal provided under section of the drt act < org > has held that when remedy of appeal was available < org > should not have entertained the petition under article of the constitution of india in this judgment < org > has held that the < org > can even go beyond", "the < org > and only fetter that is put on its power is to observe principles of natural justice where the learned single judge has observed that the requirement of natural justice has been expressly provided under section of the npa act and once the rule of natural justice is followed by the procedure under section of the npa act no further notice is required to be given under section of the npa act mr < name > also placed heavy reliance on the judgment of < org > in < org > supra < org > observed that the employment of the said two monosyllables is of great jurisprudential import in the same clause dealing with two rights regarding the same burden must have two different imports mr < name > contended that applying this principle to sub section i of section while the secured creditor has an option to make a request to the cmm dm the cmm dm shall on such request being made to him take possession of the asset and for securing compliance he may cause force to be used mr < name > further contended that the submission that appeal provided under section is illusory has been dealt with by < org > in < org > supra mr < name > contended that there is enough indication in section a and explanation to section that a third party has no right at the stage of section a that is at the stage of communication of reasons to the borrower to make an application to the drt under sub section of section while section a gives a right only to the borrower to raise an objection and states that the secured creditor has to consider the objection within one week and communicate the non acceptance if any to the borrower the proviso to sub section a says that the communication of reason shall not confer on the borrower a right to prefer an application to drt under section at the stage of communication of reasons section gives a right of appeal to any person including borrower explanation states that at the stage of communication of reasons the person including the borrower shall not be entitled to make an application to drt under sub section of section < name > the learned counsel appearing for the respondent bank in criminal writ petition no of adopted the submissions advanced on behalf of the petitioners the learned counsel drew our attention to judgments of the < org > where such appeals are entertained and in some cases relief is also given mr < name > the learned counsel appearing for respondent in writ petition no of adopted the arguments of the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners mr < name > and mr < name > who appear for respondent in criminal writ petition no of have submitted written submissions though in < org >", "case supra < org > was considering whether withdrawal of a in terms of the first proviso to section of the drt act is a condition precedent to taking recourse to the npa act while dealing with this question < org > observed that three points arise for determination out of the those three points the point which is relevant for the present case is as follows whether recourse to take possession of the secured assets of the borrower in terms of section of the npa act comprehends the power to take actual possession of the immoveable property the npa act enables the banks and financial institutions to realise long term assets manage problems of liquidity asset liability mis match and to improve recovery of debts by exercising powers to take possession of securities sell them and thereby reduce non performing assets by adopting measures for recovery and reconstruction the npa act further provides for setting up of asset reconstruction companies which are empowered to take possession of secured assets of the borrower including the right to transfer by way of lease assignment or sale a the drt act did not provide for assignment of debts to securitisation companies the secured assets could not be liquidated in time the npa act was enacted to reduce mounting non performing assets by empowering banks to liquidate the assets and secured interest the npa act deals with crystallized liabilities the npa act proceeds on the basis that the asset is created in favour of bank which could be assigned to the assets management company which steps into the shoes of the secured creditors section proceeds on the basis that the borrower is under a liability and his account in the books of account of the bank is classified as sub standard or doubtful or loss the npa act comes into force only if these two conditions are satisfied since section deals with liquidation of liability on the basis that the account of the borrower has become non performing there is no scope of any dispute regarding liability the npa act does not deal with disputes between the secured creditors and the borrowers but it deals with the rights of the secured creditors interse section and section of the npa act proceed on the basis that the security interest in the bank and financial institution needs to be enforced expeditiously without the intervention of the < org > and that enforcement could take place by non adjudicatory process the npa act provides for recovery of possession by non adjudicatory process the npa act removes all fetters on the right of the secured creditor i under section the < org > is required to consider whether any of the measures referred to in section are in accordance with the provisions of the npa act and the rules made thereunder if while examining the application under section the drt comes to the", "conclusion that any of the measures taken under section are not in accordance with npa act it shall direct the secured creditor to restore the possession to the borrower or restore management to the borrower if the < org > declares that the recourse taken under section is in accordance with the provisions of the npa act then notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force the secured creditor shall be entitled to take recourse to anyone or more of the measures as specified under section to recover his secured debt section shows that the secured creditor is free to take recourse to any one of the measures under section notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force for the sake of argument if in a given case the measures undertaken by the secured creditor under section come in conflict with the < org > land revenue law then notwithstanding such conflict the provision of section shall override the local law this position stands clarified by section of the npa act which states that the provisions of the npa act shall override all other laws which are inconsistent with the npa act section gives an overriding effect to the npa act over all other laws if they are in consistent with it the dichotomy between symbolic and physical possession does not find place in the npa act rule of the said rules deals with the sale of immoveable secured assets rule deals with the stage anterior to the issuance of sale certificate and delivery of possession under rule rule relates to time of sale issue of sale certificate and delivery of possession the court receiver can take symbolic possession and in appropriate cases he can take actual possession even prior to the decree the authorised officer powers are greater as security interest is already created in the bank hence under rule he can take steps to preserve the secured asset till issuance of the sale certificate under rule rule states that on confirmation of sale if the terms of payment are complied with the authorised officer shall issue a sale certificate in favour of the purchaser rule states that the authorised officer shall deliver the property to the buyer free from all encumbrances known to the secured creditor or not known to the secured creditor this scheme of the npa act therefore does not disclose any dichotomy between symbolic possession and physical possession since scheme of section read with section shows that if the borrower is dispossessed not in accordance with the provisions of the npa act the drt is entitled to restore status quo ante it cannot be said that if possession is taken before confirmation of sale the rights of the borrower to get the dispute adjudicated upon is defeated by the authorised officer taking possession the disputes which are sought to be avoided by rule read with rule of", "the said rules are those where third party interests are created overnight and in very many cases those third parties take up the defence of being a bonafide purchaser for value without notice if any reply is submitted by the borrower the bank has to consider it and if it does not accept it it has to communicate the reasons to the borrower there is no scope for any dispute regarding liability section and proceed on the basis that the security interest in the bank and financial institution needs to be enforced expeditiously without intervention of the court by non adjudicatory process till application under section is made there is no adjudication of any kind if possession is given without resistance there is no need of approaching the cmm dm under section the argument that taking physical possession of secured asset is not contemplated under the npa act must be rejected in view of the clear observation of < org > in < org > case that the dichotomy between symbolic and physical possession does not find place in the npa act similarly when the secured creditor approaches < org > for assistance to take possession of the secured asset the liability having been crystallized there can be no adjudication about it at that stage there is no question of pointing out to < org > at that stage that the person who is to be dispossessed is a tenant or that he has a prior registered sale deed or that in case of simple mortgage ownership rights are not transferred that the mortgagee is only entitled to an obligation to pay and hence possession cannot be taken or that such a course will improve or change the contract etc grievance that reasons for not accepting the objections were not communicated can also not be raised at that stage because consideration of reply is in the realm of adjudication which cannot be done under section besides as per proviso to section a and explanation to section non communication of reasons to the borrower does not confer on the borrower or any person right to prefer an application under section at the stage of communication remedy is provided in section where appropriate relief can be given to them in any case it is also held by < org > in < org > case supra that if the measures undertaken by the secured creditor come in conflict with any other law the provisions of section override these provisions and that section gives an overriding effect to the npa act we also find no substance in the submission that remedy of appeal application provided under section of the npa act is illusory in this connection we may usefully refer to the judgment of < org > in < org > supra the argument that it will not be possible to produce any documents there that there objection", "can be taken only to procedural irregularities about measures taken under section must also be rejected in this connection we may also refer to the judgment of < org > in < org > case supra in that case < org > has after referring to its earlier judgment reiterated that the < org > can travel beyond the < org > and the only fetter that is put on its powers is to observe the principles of natural justice < org > has further observed that the < org > can pass orders to secure the ends of justice it is also not possible for us to hold that remedy provided under section is not available to a third party this section begins with the words any person including borrower aggrieved by any of the measures referred to in sub section of section in our opinion the words any person including borrower cover third parties also under section a the secured creditor is required to communicate to the borrower reasons for not accepting his objection to the notice under section but the reasons so communicated does not confer any right on the borrower to make an application before the < org > under section explanation to section states that communication of reasons to the borrower does not entitle the person including borrower to make an application to < org > under section at the stage of communication < name > the learned counsel appearing for the respondent bank has drawn our attention to the judgments of the < org > where rights of third parties are dealt with and relief is granted to them there is also no substance in the submission that no relief can be given to a third party because section speaks only of restoration of possession of the secured asset to the borrower section states that if the < org > comes to the conclusion that any of the measures stated in section taken by the secured creditor are not in accordance with the npa act and the rules made thereunder it can restore possession of the secured assets to the borrower or restore the management of the secured asset to the borrower section further goes on to say that < org > can pass such order as it may consider appropriate and necessary in relation to any of the recourse taken by the secured creditor under sub section of section therefore there is no reason to conclude that no orders can be passed in respect of third parties by < org > under section section which provides for appeal to < org > also states that any person aggrieved by any order made by < org > under section may prefer an appeal to an < org > there is no provision under the npa act putting fetters on the drts powers particularly when in < or", "##g > case supra < org > has held that it can travel beyond the < org > and it can pass orders to secure ends of justice there is no doubt that a party who is likely to be adversely affected by any action must be given a hearing before the action is taken it proceeds on the basis that liability of the borrower is crystallized in our opinion to secure its object the npa act has by necessary implication ruled out giving hearing either to the borrower or third parties till the application is filed under section as observed by < org > in transcore scase supra section of the npa act inter alia states that the bank or financial institution may if it considers appropriate give a notice of acquisition of financial assets by any securitisation company or reconstruction company to the borrower and to any other concerned person but they may or may not give notice to the borrower regarding acquisition of financial assets the reason being that assets are transferable overnight section a requires the secured creditor to communicate to the borrower reasons for not accepting his representation or objection and proviso thereto states that such communication shall not confer right on the borrower to make an application under section at that stage section with which we are concerned here does not contemplate any notice to the borrower or a third party it is only section which states that any person including borrower can make an application to < org > being aggrieved by any measure taken under section explanation to section clarifies that reasons communicated to a borrower at the stage of communication will not confer on the person including borrower any right to make an application to < org > under section section again confers right on any person aggrieved by an order of < org > under section to file an appeal before < org > against the said order nothing prevented the legislature from specifically making a provision in section for notice to the borrower or third party it purposely did not make provision for notice or hearing being given to the borrower or third party at the stage of section though the validity fo the npa act is upheld and that cannot be in issue before us we may refer to the observation of < org > in < name > supra on behalf of the respondents it was urged that the cmm dm acting under section is performing a ministerial function and hence it is not necessary to give a hearing to the affected parties as he cannot determine the rights of the parties it was also argued that section gives finality to order passed by the cmm dm under section and therefore it is necessary to hear parties who are likely to be adversely affected by it we find no substance in this submission chief", "metropolitan magistrate or district magistrate to assist secured creditor in taking possession of secured asset for the purpose of securing compliance with the provisions of sub section the chief metropolitan magistrate of the district magistrate may take or cause to be taken such steps and use or cause to be used such force as may in his opinion be necessary no act of the chief metropolitan magistrate or the district magistrate done in pursuance of this section shall be called in question in any court or before any authority sub section grants immunity to the cmm dm as regards steps taken by him or force allowed to be used by him for providing assistance for taking possession since as stated by us adjudication of rival claims is absent at that stage there is no question of his dealing with rival claims and giving a reasoned judgment as regards the merits of the case and obviously there is no question of such a reasoning assuming finality we must also refer to the judgment of < org > in < org > scase supra on which reliance is placed by mr < name > in that case while considering the nature of the power exercised by the chief justices of < org > or chief justice of india under section of the arbitration act < org > held that any tribunal conferred with a power to act under a statute has a jurisdiction to satisfy itself whether the conditions for exercise of power existed the chief justice or the person designated by him is bound to decide whether he has jurisdiction whether there is arbitration agreement whether the conditions for the exercise of powers have been fulfilled and if an arbitrator is appointed whether he is a fit person in fact in < org > scase supra < org > has clearly stated that while exercising the power under section of the arbitration act the chief justice has to consider whether the conditions laid down by the section exist or not in our opinion at the time of passing order under section of the npa act the cmm dm will have to consider only two aspects he must find out whether the secured asset falls within his territorial jurisdiction and whether notice under section of npa act is given or not on the other hand the learned counsel for the petitioners contended that there are no fetters on the powers of this court conferred upon it by articles

person who may be in possession of secured asset and give him a hearing we have also heard mr < name > the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners in criminal writ petition no of we have heard them on their request though the petitions in which they are appearing have been disposed of by separate orders we may briefly refer to the facts averred in criminal writ petition no of it appears that since the petitioners failed to repay the debt respondent issued a notice dated under section of the npa act and called upon the petitioners to pay sum of rs the case of the petitioners further is that respondent filed an application in < org > esplanade mumbai under section of the npa act praying for assistance to take possession of the said flat the petitioners have challenged the said order in this writ petition before we deal with the attack on the impugned order we must note that affidavit has been filed by petitioner reiterating that the notice sent by respondent under section of the npa act has been duly replied by the petitioners on affidavit in reply has been filed on behalf of respondent by mr < name > asstt mr < name > submitted that this section which speaks of the power of the chief metropolitan magistrate district magistrate for convenience the cmm dm to assist the secured creditor in taking possession of secured asset begins with the words where the possession of secured assets is required to be taken by the secured creditor mr < name > contended that it is implicit in this sentence that the cmm dm has to apply his mind as to whether possession is required to be taken or not there could be cases where after due application of mind it may appear to the cmm dm that it is not necessary to take possession mr < name > submitted that while exercising jurisdiction under section the cmm dm must see whether there is compliance of section a mr < name > contended that section a requires that if on receipt of the notice under sub section the borrower makes any representation or raises any objection the secured creditor shall consider such representation or objection and if the secured creditor comes to the conclusion that such representation or objection is not acceptable or tenable he shall communicate within one week of receipt of such representation or objection the reasons for nonacceptance of the representation or objection to the borrower", "he pointed out that < org > has observed that the secured creditor must bear in mind the say of the borrower before process of recovery is initiated and so as to demonstrate that the reply of the borrower to the notice under section of the npa act has been considered applying mind to it the reasons however brief that may be for not accepting the objections if raised in the reply must be communicated to the borrower mr < name > pointed out that < org > has also expressed that while resorting to such legislation it would be necessary to see that the persons

objection to the notice under section of the npa act that objection was not considered by the secured creditor no reasoned reply was given to the secured creditor mr < name > then contended that section states that no act of the cmm dm in pursuance of this section shall be called in question in any court or before any authority remedy of appeal is provided in section against measures in section it is not an appeal against power exercised under section mr < name > contended that it is true that the npa act is enacted keeping in view mounting levels of non performing assets of banks

was considering the nature of power exercised by the chief justices of < org > or the chief justice of india under section of the arbitration and conciliation act for short the arbitration act mr <

chief justice has to consider as to whether the conditions laid down by the section for the exercise of that power or for the performance of that duty exist and therefore while functioning under section of the arbitration act the chief justice or the person or institution designated by him is bound to decide whether he has jurisdiction whether there is an arbitration agreement whether the applicant before him is a party whether the conditions for exercise of the power have been fulfilled and if an arbitrator is to be appointed who is the fit person in terms of the provision < org > noted that section of the arbitration act makes his decision on the matters entrusted to him final mr < name > contended that in this case also the cmm dm has to decide whether the preliminary facts enabling him to exercise jurisdiction under section of the npa act exist he referred to order xxi rules and of the and contended that sale of the immoveable property in occupation of the judgment debtor takes place before taking possession mr < name > also referred to section which states that the secured creditor may require by notice in writing from any person who has acquired any of the secured assets from the borrower and from whom any money may become due to the borrower to pay him as much of the money as is sufficient to pay the secured debt he pointed out that under rule a the notice which the authorised officer has to serve on the borrower must include the description of the immoveable property to be sold including the details of the encumbrances known to the secured creditor in such cases the authorised officer may if he thinks fit allow the purchaser to deposit with him the money required to discharge the encumbrances under sub rule on such deposit for discharge of encumbrances the authorised officer may issue notice to the person entitled to the money deposited and take steps to make the payment accordingly and under sub rule the authorised officer shall deliver the property to the purchaser free from encumbrances he submitted that the legislature has used the word shall in rule he must inter alia find out whether there is a valid and subsisting

npa act proceeds on the basis that the borrower who is under disability has failed to discharge his liability within the period prescribed under section which enables the secured creditor to take recourse to one or more of the measures namely taking possession of the secured assets including the right to transfer by way of lease assignment or sale for realising the secured assets mr < name >

that even if a statute is silent and there are no positive words in the act or the rules made thereunder there could be nothing wrong in spelling out the need to hear the parties whose rights and interests are likely to be affected by the orders that may be passed and making it a requirement to follow a fair procedure before taking a decision unless the statutes provides otherwise mr < name > contended that this observation would apply with equal or more force to the judicial powers exercised by the cmm dm under section of the npa act where termination of the membership of members from the council was challenged on the ground that they were not given notice and they were not heard and therefore there was a violation of principles of natural justice this provision according to mr < name

definite judgment which has finality mr < name > also referred to the judgment of < org > in < org > supra for highlight", "##ing the object of the npa act mr < name > submitted that the legislature has on purpose excluded hearing to the borrower or third parties and this < org > should interpret section in a manner which will further the object of the npa act rather than frustrate it mr < name > however accepted that in a given case of gross injustice this court can entertain a writ petition and give relief to the affected party mr < name > further submitted that the judgment in < org > scase

provision enabling < org > to make rules in respect of section that is because the cmm dm exercises ministerial power mr < name > then submitted that in < org > supra < org > has upheld the validity of the npa act mr < name > contended that the provisions of the npa act have to be interpreted keeping in mind its background and when there is conflict between law and equity it is the law which has to prevail mr < name > submitted that when alternative and efficacious remedy is provided under section the petitioner cannot invoke writ jurisdiction of this court where in the context of appeal provided under section of the drt act < org > has held that when remedy of appeal was available < org > should not have entertained the petition under article of the constitution of india in this judgment < org > has held that the < org > can even go beyond", "the < org > and only fetter that is put on its power is to observe principles of natural justice where the learned single judge has observed that the requirement of natural justice has been expressly provided under section of the npa act and once the rule of natural justice is followed by the procedure under section of the npa act no further notice is required to be given under section of the npa act mr < name > also placed heavy reliance on the judgment of < org > in < org > supra < org > observed that the employment of the said two monosyllables is of great jurisprudential import in the same clause dealing with two rights regarding the same burden must have two different imports mr < name > contended that applying this principle to sub section i of section while the secured creditor has an option to make a request to the cmm dm the cmm dm shall on such request being made to him take possession of the asset and for securing compliance he may cause force to be used mr < name > further contended that the submission that appeal provided under section is illusory has been dealt with by < org > in < org > supra mr < name > contended that there is enough indication in section a and explanation to section that a third party has no right at the stage of section a that is at the stage of communication of reasons to the borrower to make an application to the drt under sub section of section while section a gives a right only to the borrower to raise an objection and states that the secured creditor has to consider the objection within one week and communicate the non acceptance if any to the borrower the proviso to sub section a says that the communication of reason shall not confer on the borrower a right to prefer an application to drt under section at the stage of communication of reasons section gives a right of appeal to any person including borrower explanation states that at the stage of communication of reasons the person including the borrower shall not be entitled to make an application to drt under sub section of section < name > the learned counsel appearing for the respondent bank in criminal writ petition no of adopted the submissions advanced on behalf of the petitioners the learned counsel drew our attention to judgments of the < org > where such appeals are entertained and in some cases relief is also given mr < name > the learned counsel appearing for respondent in writ petition no of adopted the arguments of the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners mr < name > and mr < name > who appear for respondent in criminal writ petition no of have submitted written submissions though in < org >", "case supra < org > was considering whether withdrawal of a in terms of the first proviso to section of the drt act is a condition precedent to taking recourse to the npa act while dealing with this question < org > observed that three points arise for determination out of the those three points the point which is relevant for the present case is as follows whether recourse to take possession of the secured assets of the borrower in terms of section of the npa act comprehends the power to take actual possession of the immoveable property the npa act enables the banks and financial institutions to realise long term assets manage problems of liquidity asset liability mis match and to improve recovery of debts by exercising powers to take possession of securities sell them and thereby reduce non performing assets by adopting measures for recovery and reconstruction the npa act further provides for setting up of asset reconstruction companies which are empowered to take possession of secured assets of the borrower including the right to transfer by way of lease assignment or sale a the drt act did not provide for assignment of debts to securitisation companies the secured assets could not be liquidated in time the npa act was enacted to reduce mounting non performing assets by empowering banks to liquidate the assets and secured interest the npa act deals with crystallized liabilities the npa act proceeds on the basis that the asset is created in favour of bank which could be assigned to the assets management company which steps into the shoes of the secured creditors section proceeds on the basis that the borrower is under a liability and his account in the books of account of the bank is classified as sub standard or doubtful or loss the npa act comes into force only if these two conditions are satisfied since section deals with liquidation of liability on the basis that the account of the borrower has become non performing there is no scope of any dispute regarding liability the npa act does not deal with disputes between the secured creditors and the borrowers but it deals with the rights of the secured creditors interse section and section of the npa act proceed on the basis that the security interest in the bank and financial institution needs to be enforced expeditiously without the intervention of the < org > and that enforcement could take place by non adjudicatory process the npa act provides for recovery of possession by non adjudicatory process the npa act removes all fetters on the right of the secured creditor i under section the < org > is required to consider whether any of the measures referred to in section are in accordance with the provisions of the npa act and the rules made thereunder if while examining the application under section the drt comes to the", "conclusion that any of the measures taken under section are not in accordance with npa act it shall direct the secured creditor to restore the possession to the borrower or restore management to the borrower if the < org > declares that the recourse taken under section is in accordance with the provisions of the npa act then notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force the secured creditor shall be entitled to take recourse to anyone or more of the measures as specified under section to recover his secured debt section shows that the secured creditor is free to take recourse to any one of the measures under section notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force for the sake of argument if in a given case the measures undertaken by the secured creditor under section come in conflict with the < org > land revenue law then notwithstanding such conflict the provision of section shall override the local law this position stands clarified by section of the npa act which states that the provisions of the npa act shall override all other laws which are inconsistent with the npa act section gives an overriding effect to the npa act over all other laws if they are in consistent with it the dichotomy between symbolic and physical possession does not find place in the npa act rule of the said rules deals with the sale of immoveable secured assets rule deals with the stage anterior to the issuance of sale certificate and delivery of possession under rule rule relates to time of sale issue of sale certificate and delivery of possession the court receiver can take symbolic possession and in appropriate cases he can take actual possession even prior to the decree the authorised officer powers are greater as security interest is already created in the bank hence under rule he can take steps to preserve the secured asset till issuance of the sale certificate under rule rule states that on confirmation of sale if the terms of payment are complied with the authorised officer shall issue a sale certificate in favour of the purchaser rule states that the authorised officer shall deliver the property to the buyer free from all encumbrances known to the secured creditor or not known to the secured creditor this scheme of the npa act therefore does not disclose any dichotomy between symbolic possession and physical possession since scheme of section read with section shows that if the borrower is dispossessed not in accordance with the provisions of the npa act the drt is entitled to restore status quo ante it cannot be said that if possession is taken before confirmation of sale the rights of the borrower to get the dispute adjudicated upon is defeated by the authorised officer taking possession the disputes which are sought to be avoided by rule read with rule of", "the said rules are those where third party interests are created overnight and in very many cases those third parties take up the defence of being a bonafide purchaser for value without notice if any reply is submitted by the borrower the bank has to consider it and if it does not accept it it has to communicate the reasons to the borrower there is no scope for any dispute regarding liability section and proceed on the basis that the security interest in the bank and financial institution needs to be enforced expeditiously without intervention of the court by non adjudicatory process till application under section is made there is no adjudication of any kind if possession is given without resistance there is no need of approaching the cmm dm under section the argument that taking physical possession of secured asset is not contemplated under the npa act must be rejected in view of the clear observation of < org > in < org > case that the dichotomy between symbolic and physical possession does not find place in the npa act similarly when the secured creditor approaches < org > for assistance to take possession of the secured asset the liability having been crystallized there can be no adjudication about it at that stage there is no question of pointing out to < org > at that stage that the person who is to be dispossessed is a tenant or that he has a prior registered sale deed or that in case of simple mortgage ownership rights are not transferred that the mortgagee is only entitled to an obligation to pay and hence possession cannot be taken or that such a course will improve or change the contract etc grievance that reasons for not accepting the objections were not communicated can also not be raised at that stage because consideration of reply is in the realm of adjudication which cannot be done under section besides as per proviso to section a and explanation to section non communication of reasons to the borrower does not confer on the borrower or any person right to prefer an application under section at the stage of communication remedy is provided in section where appropriate relief can be given to them in any case it is also held by < org > in < org > case supra that if the measures undertaken by the secured creditor come in conflict with any other law the provisions of section override these provisions and that section gives an overriding effect to the npa act we also find no substance in the submission that remedy of appeal application provided under section of the npa act is illusory in this connection we may usefully refer to the judgment of < org > in < org > supra the argument that it will not be possible to produce any documents there that there objection", "can be taken only to procedural irregularities about measures taken under section must also be rejected in this connection we may also refer to the judgment of < org > in < org > case supra in that case < org > has after referring to its earlier judgment reiterated that the < org > can travel beyond the < org > and the only fetter that is put on its powers is to observe the principles of natural justice < org > has further observed that the < org > can pass orders to secure the ends of justice it is also not possible for us to hold that remedy provided under section is not available to a third party this section begins with the words any person including borrower aggrieved by any of the measures referred to in sub section of section in our opinion the words any person including borrower cover third parties also under section a the secured creditor is required to communicate to the borrower reasons for not accepting his objection to the notice under section but the reasons so communicated does not confer any right on the borrower to make an application before the < org > under section explanation to section states that communication of reasons to the borrower does not entitle the person including borrower to make an application to < org > under section at the stage of communication < name > the learned counsel appearing for the respondent bank has drawn our attention to the judgments of the < org > where rights of third parties are dealt with and relief is granted to them there is also no substance in the submission that no relief can be given to a third party because section speaks only of restoration of possession of the secured asset to the borrower section states that if the < org > comes to the conclusion that any of the measures stated in section taken by the secured creditor are not in accordance with the npa act and the rules made thereunder it can restore possession of the secured assets to the borrower or restore the management of the secured asset to the borrower section further goes on to say that < org > can pass such order as it may consider appropriate and necessary in relation to any of the recourse taken by the secured creditor under sub section of section therefore there is no reason to conclude that no orders can be passed in respect of third parties by < org > under section section which provides for appeal to < org > also states that any person aggrieved by any order made by < org > under section may prefer an appeal to an < org > there is no provision under the npa act putting fetters on the drts powers particularly when in < or", "##g > case supra < org > has held that it can travel beyond the < org > and it can pass orders to secure ends of justice there is no doubt that a party who is likely to be adversely affected by any action must be given a hearing before the action is taken it proceeds on the basis that liability of the borrower is crystallized in our opinion to secure its object the npa act has by necessary implication ruled out giving hearing either to the borrower or third parties till the application is filed under section as observed by < org > in transcore scase supra section of the npa act inter alia states that the bank or financial institution may if it considers appropriate give a notice of acquisition of financial assets by any securitisation company or reconstruction company to the borrower and to any other concerned person but they may or may not give notice to the borrower regarding acquisition of financial assets the reason being that assets are transferable overnight section a requires the secured creditor to communicate to the borrower reasons for not accepting his representation or objection and proviso thereto states that such communication shall not confer right on the borrower to make an application under section at that stage section with which we are concerned here does not contemplate any notice to the borrower or a third party it is only section which states that any person including borrower can make an application to < org > being aggrieved by any measure taken under section explanation to section clarifies that reasons communicated to a borrower at the stage of communication will not confer on the person including borrower any right to make an application to < org > under section section again confers right on any person aggrieved by an order of < org > under section to file an appeal before < org > against the said order nothing prevented the legislature from specifically making a provision in section for notice to the borrower or third party it purposely did not make provision for notice or hearing being given to the borrower or third party at the stage of section though the validity fo the npa act is upheld and that cannot be in issue before us we may refer to the observation of < org > in < name > supra on behalf of the respondents it was urged that the cmm dm acting under section is performing a ministerial function and hence it is not necessary to give a hearing to the affected parties as he cannot determine the rights of the parties it was also argued that section gives finality to order passed by the cmm dm under section and therefore it is necessary to hear parties who are likely to be adversely affected by it we find no substance in this submission chief", "metropolitan magistrate or district magistrate to assist secured creditor in taking possession of secured asset for the purpose of securing compliance with the provisions of sub section the chief metropolitan magistrate of the district magistrate may take or cause to be taken such steps and use or cause to be used such force as may in his opinion be necessary no act of the chief metropolitan magistrate or the district magistrate done in pursuance of this section shall be called in question in any court or before any authority sub section grants immunity to the cmm dm as regards steps taken by him or force allowed to be used by him for providing assistance for taking possession since as stated by us adjudication of rival claims is absent at that stage there is no question of his dealing with rival claims and giving a reasoned judgment as regards the merits of the case and obviously there is no question of such a reasoning assuming finality we must also refer to the judgment of < org > in < org > scase supra on which reliance is placed by mr < name > in that case while considering the nature of the power exercised by the chief justices of < org > or chief justice of india under section of the arbitration act < org > held that any tribunal conferred with a power to act under a statute has a jurisdiction to satisfy itself whether the conditions for exercise of power existed the chief justice or the person designated by him is bound to decide whether he has jurisdiction whether there is arbitration agreement whether the conditions for the exercise of powers have been fulfilled and if an arbitrator is appointed whether he is a fit person in fact in < org > scase supra < org > has clearly stated that while exercising the power under section of the arbitration act the chief justice has to consider whether the conditions laid down by the section exist or not in our opinion at the time of passing order under section of the npa act the cmm dm will have to consider only two aspects he must find out whether the secured asset falls within his territorial jurisdiction and whether notice under section of npa act is given or not on the other hand the learned counsel for the petitioners contended that there are no fetters on the powers of this court conferred upon it by articles and of the constitution of india and though alternative remedy is available if by the time the party avails of it great hardship and injustice is likely to be caused in a given case this court can pass appropriate orders to redress the grievance of such a party in < org > supra < org > had allowed the petition filed by the guarantor by holding that as the mortgaged property", "was situated in chennai the < org > had no territorial jurisdiction and it could not have directed sale of mortgaged property < org > clarified that though no provision of the < org > act expressly ousts the jurisdiction of < org > under articles and of the constitution nevertheless when there is an alternative remedy available judicial prudence demands that the court refrains from exercising its jurisdiction under the constitutional provisions similarly if < org > finds that the action taken by the bank or financial institution on the face of it cannot be sustained because it is hit by section of the npa act < org > may entertain a writ petition as done by the nagpur bench of this court in < org > supra a writ petition may have to be entertained if reasons for not accepting objections of the borrower to notice under section are not communicated to the borrower it will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case in this connection we may refer to the judgment of <

the secured asset falls within the jurisdiction of < org > before whom application under section is made the bank and financial institution shall also consider before approaching < org > for an order under section of the npa act whether section of the npa act excludes the application of sections and thereof to the case on hand cmm dm acting under section of the npa act is not required to give notice either to the borrower or to the rd party he has to only verify from the bank or financial institution whether notice under section of the npa act is given or not and whether the secured assets fall within his jurisdiction there is no adjudication of it is only if the above conditions are not fulfilled that the cmm dm can refuse to pass an order under section of the npa act by recording that the above conditions are not fulfilled if these two conditions are fulfilled he cannot refuse to pass an order under section remedy provided under section of the npa act is available to the borrower

under ti as pilfer proof caps therefore in effect he stated that while these tear off and tear down seals may contribute towards safety from pilferage their main function was not that and that these

of reservation is to provide adequate representation to the scheduled castes tribes and backward classes in services and as such any mechanism provided to achieve that end must have nexus to the object sought to be achieved there were already members of the said category in the cadre but out of them were promoted on the basis of seniority cum merit against the general cat egory posts there being only persons who had been promoted against the reserved posts more scheduled castes were sought to be promoted against the reserve vacancies when a percentage of reservation is fixed in respect of a particular cadre and the roster indicates the reserve points it has to be taken that the posts shown at the reserve points are to be filled from amongst the members of reserve categories and the candidates belonging to the general category are not entitled to be considered for the reserve posts article of the constitution of india permits < org > to make any provision for the reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any backward class of citizen which in the opinion of the < org > is not adequately represented in the < org > under the < org > the fact that considerable number of members of a backward class have been ap pointed promoted against general seats in the < org > < org > may be a relevant factor for < org > to review the question of continuing reservation for the said class but so long as the instructions rules providing certain percentage of reservations for the backward classes are op erative the same have to be followed we therefore see no force in the first contention raised by the learned counsel and reject the same we see considered force in the second contention raised by the learned counsel for the petitioners we see no justification to operate the roster thereafter as and when there is a vacancy whether permanent or temporary in a particular post the same has to be filled from amongst the category to which the post belonged in the roster similarly if the persons holding the post at points to or to retire then these slots are to be filled from among the general category by following this procedure them shall neither be short fall nor excess in the percentage of reservation right to be consid ered for appointment can only be claimed in respect of a post in a cadre as a consequence the percentage of reservation has to be worked out in relation to the number of posts which form the cadre strength the concept of vacancy has no relevance in operating the percentage of reservation neither should be allowed to", "eclipse the other for the above reason we hold that for the purpose of applying the rule of a year should be taken as the unit and not the entire of the cadre service or the unit as the case may be the operation of a roster for filling the cadre strength by itself ensures that the reservation remains within the limit on the basis of the material placed before < org > it reached the conclusion that if the reservation is permitted in the vacancies after all the posts in cadre are filled then serious consequences would ensure and the general category is likely to suffer considerably again in the more persons belonging to the general category persons out of the retire again in the year more persons belonging to the general category retire on the contrary if the roster is permitted to operate till the total posts in a cadre are filled by the same category of persons whose retirement etc we therefore find considerable force in the second point raised by the learned counsel for the petitioners we

{"query": "explanation appended to that rule the discharge of a person appointed on probation during the period of probation would not amount to removal or dismissal within the meaning of the rule on the basis of the explanation the learned judge held that since the appellant was only a probationer and since he had been discharged during the period of his probation he had neither been dismissed nor removed and therefore he could not complain that the protection of article had not been made available to him the learned judge found it unnecessary to decide whether what had taken place could be said to have been an enquiry as contemplated by article or the relevant service rules because in his view the appellant having been a mere probationer was not entitled to an enquiry of that kind at all on the broad features of the case the learned judge held that it could not fairly be said that the appellant had had no opportunity for establishing his innocence he pointed out that the authorities had proceeded on documents which had been fully dealt with by the appellant in his representations and that he had been given opportunity to show cause against both the charges and the penalty proposed to be imposed on him i should explain here that rule provides that where it is proposed to terminate the employment of a probationer whether during or at the end of the period of probation for any specific fault on account of his unsuitability for the service he shall be apprised of the grounds of such proposal and given an opportunity to show cause against it there is no such rule amongst the bengal subordinate services discipline and appeal rules and that explains why the learned judge said even if rule applies it appears to me that the view taken by the learned judge of the proceedings had against the appellant is not warranted by the facts if the service of a probationer is terminated merely on the ground of his work being unsatisfactory and terminated in accordance with the terms of the employment no question of any penalty being imposed it is true arises but even a probationer can be proceeded against for misconduct and proceedings with a view to imposing a penalty can be taken against a probationer as well as i have explained elsewhere a probationer will normally servo up to the end of the probationary period and then be either confirmed if his work has been found satisfactory or discharged if the reverse has been the case but if before me probationary period is over or if although the period is over the < org > servant concerned is still holding the
