That Act levied a tax on passengers and goods carried by public service motor vehicles in Bihar The appellants challenged the validity of the Act and certain provisions of the Act were struck down by this Court By that Ordinance the provisions of the Act of which had been struck down by this Court were validated and brought into force retrospectively from the date when the earlier Act purported to come into force As a result of the retrospective operation of the Act of its material provisions were deemed to have come into force from April the date on which the Act of came into force The appellants challenged the validity of the Act of but their writ petitions were dismissed by <ORG> which held that the Act in its entirety was valid The appellants came to this Court by special leave What was contended by the appellants was that the provisions of in so far as they referred to proceedings commenced under the Act of but not completed before the Act of came into force were invalid It was also contended that the retrospective operation prescribed by and a part of so completely altered the character of the tax proposed to be retrospectively recovered that it introduced a serious infirmity in the legislative competence of <ORG> itself and the retrospective operation was so unreasonable that it could not be saved either under Art or Art Held that if in its essential features a taxing statute is within the competence of the <ORG> which passed it by reference to the relevant entry in the List its character is not necessarily changed merely by its retrospective operation so as to make the said retrospective operation outside the legislative competence of the said legislature Held also that the restriction imposed on the fundamental rights of the appellants under Art The test of the length of time covered by the retrospective operations cannot by itself be treated as a decisive test Where the legislature can make a valid law it can provide not only for the prospective operation of the material provisions of the said law but it can also provide for he retrospective operation of the said provisions The legislative power includes the subsidiary or the auxiliary power to validate law which is found to be invalid If a law passed by the legislature is struck down by the Courts it is competent to the appropriate legislature to pass a validating law so as to make the provisions of the earlier law effective from the date when it was passed The power of taxing people and their property is an essential attribute of Government and the Government can legitimately exercise the said power by reference to the objects to which it is applicable to the utmost extent to which Government thinks it expedient to do so The quantum of tax levied by the taxing statute the conditions subject to which it is levied the manner in which it is sought to be recovered are all matters within the competence of the legislature The short question which these two appeals raise for our decision is in regard to the validity of the retrospective operation of the Bihar Taxation on Passengers and Goods Carried by Public Service Motor Vehicles Act No It is true that the two writ petitions Nos and filed by the appellants <ORG> and <ORG> respectively in <ORG> at Patna along with others under Articles and of the Constitution had challenged the validity of the whole of the Act In their appeals brought to this Court by special leave against the said judgment the appellants do not challenge the conclusion of <ORG> that the Act is valid in so far as its prospective operation is concerned they have confined their appeals to its retrospective operation Before dealing with the points raised by the appellants it is necessary to set out briefly the background of the present dispute On March <ORG> passed the Bihar Finance Act Bihar Act of this Act levied a tax on passengers and goods carried by public service motor vehicles in Bihar Nearly a year after this Act came into force the appellants challenged its validity by instituting a suit No in <ORG> at Gaya on May In this suit the appellants prayed that the provisions of Part III of the said Act were unconstitutional and asked for an injunction restraining the respondent the State of Bihar from levying and realising the said tax This latter suit was filed by the passengers and owners of goods in a representative capacity under A special Bench of <ORG> which heard the said two suits dismissed them on May <ORG> found that the said Act of did not contravene Art The appellants then preferred an appeal to this Court No That is why the appeal was allowed and the appellants were granted the declaration and injunction claimed by them in their suit By this Ordinance the material provisions of the earlier Act Of which had been struck down by this Court were validated and brought into force retrospectively from the date when the earlier Act had purported to come into force As a result of the retrospective operation of this Act its material provisions are deemed to have come into force on April that is to say the date on which the earlier Act of had come into force The appellants and the other petitioners who had joined by filing several petitions in <ORG> had challenged the validity of the Act on several grounds <ORG> has rejected all these grounds and has taken the view that the Act in its entirety is valid <ORG> has found that the provisions of the Act no doubt take it within the purview of Part XIII of the Constitution but it has held that the Act has been passed with the previous sanction of the President and the restrictions imposed by it are otherwise reasonable and so it is saved under Art The plea made by the respondent that the taxing provisions of the Act were compensatory in character and were therefore valid was rejected by <ORG> The argument that the Act was invalid because it required the appellants to act as the Agents of the respondent for collecting the tax from the passengers and from the owners of the goods without payment of any remuneration was rejected by <ORG> It was also urged that the Act contravened the provisions of Art of the Constitution but <ORG> was not impressed with this argument and the plea that the matters in dispute between the appellants and the respondent are really concluded by res judicata That is how the writ petitions filed by the appellants failed and so they have come to this Court confining their challenge only to the validity of the restrospective operation of the Act The Finance Act of was an amending Act it was passed because it was thought expedient by <ORG> to amend the earlier Bihar Sales Tax Act and the Bihar Agricultural Income Tax Act Section of the said Act levied a tax on passengers and goods carried or transported by public service vehicles and public carriers Section prescribed the rate of the said taxation As Sub section dealt with the cases where any fare or freight was charged in a lump sum either for carrying goods or by way of contribution for a season ticket or otherwise and sub section provided that every owner of the public vehicle shall pay into <ORG> the full amount of the tax due from him under sub section or sub section in such a manner and at such intervals as may be prescribed and shall furnish such returns by such dates and to such authority as may be prescribed In an amending Act was passed Bihar Act of and section of this amending Act added an explanation to section of the Act of By this explanation every passenger carried bythe public vehicle and every person whose goods weretransported by a public carrier was made liable to pay to the owner of the said carrier the amount of tax payable under subsections and of section and every owner of the vehicle or carrier was authorised to recover such tax from such passenger or person In other words whereas before the passing of the amending Act the owners of public vehicles may have been entitled to raise their fares or freight charges in order to enable them to pay the tax levied under of the Act of after the amending Act was passed they became entitled to recover the specific amounts from passengers and owners of goods by way of tax payable by them under the said section After the Act as thus amended was struck down by this Court on December an Ordinance was passed and its provisions were included in the impugned Act which ultimately became the law in Bihar on September The Act consists of sections Section expressly provides that the Act shall be deemed to have come into force on the first day of April Section provides that on and from the date on which this Act is deemed to have come into force under sub section of section there shall be levied and paid to <ORG> a tax on all passengers and goods carried by a public service motor vehicles Then the sub section prescribes the rate at which the said tax has to be paid There is a proviso to this sub section which it is unnecessary to set out Sub section lays down that every owner shall in the manner prescribed in section pay to <ORG> the amount of tax due under this section and sub section adds that every passenger carried by a public service motor vehicle and every person whose goods are carried by such vehicle shall be liable to pay to the owner the amount of tax payable under this section and every owner shall recover such tax from such passenger or person as the case may be There are three more sub sections to this section which need not detain us It would be noticed that the effect of is that the passengers and the owners of goods are made liable to pay the tax to the owner of the public service motor vehicle and the latter is made liable to pay the tax to <ORG> and both these provisions act retrospectively by virtue of In other words the tax is levied on passengers and goods carried by the public vehicles and the machinery devised is that the tax would be recovered from the owners of such vehicles Section deals with the procedure for the assessment of tax Section provides for the payment of fixed amount in lieu of tax and under provision is made for the payment and recovery of tax Section deals with the special mode of recovery Section deals with cases of transfer of public service motor vehicle and makes both the transferor and the transferee liable for the tax as prescribed by it Under power is given subject to such rules as may be made by <ORG> to the Commissioner or the prescribed authority to secure the production inspection and seizure of accounts and documents and search of premises and vehicles Section makes the Commissioner and the prescribed authority public servants and section deals with offences and penalties Section deals with compounding of offences Section prescribes the usual bar to certain proceedings and section refers to Section confers power on <ORG> to make rules It reads thus Notwithstanding any judgment decree or order of any <ORG> tribunal or authority a any amount paid collected or recovered or purported to have been paid collected or recovered as tax or Penalty under the provisions of Part III of the Bihar Finance Act Bihar Act XVII of as amended from time to time hereinafter referred to as the said Act or the rules made thereunder during the period beginning with the first day of April and ending on the thirty first day of July shall be deemed to have been validly levied paid collected or recovered under the provisions of this Act and any proceeding commenced or purported to have been commenced for the assessment collection or recovery of any amount as tax or penalty under the provisions of the said Act or the rules made thereunder during the period specified in clause a shall be deemed to have been commenced and conducted in accordance with the provisions of this Act and if not already completed shall be continued and cornpleted of this Act in accordance with the provisions There is a proviso to this section which is not relevant for our purpose Sections and deal with repeals and savings and section provides that if any difficulty arises in giving effect to the provisions of the Act the State Government may pass an order in that behalf subject to the limitations prescribed by the said section In order to appreciate the merits of the contentions raised by Mr <NAME> on behalf of the appellants it is necessary to specify clearly the limited character of the controversy between the parties in appeal It would be noticed that apart from the general retrospective operation of the Act for which a provision has been made by itself makes a clear retrospective validating provision and it is not disputed that the acts validated by a have been properly validated With regard to the validating provision contained in it has been urged that the said provision in so far as it refers to proceedings commenced under the earlier Act but not completed before the impugned Act came into force is invalid The argument however is that its retrospective operation prescribed by and by a part of so completely alters the character of the tax proposed to be retrospectively recovered that it introduces a serious infirmity in the legislative competence of <ORG> itself It is these two narrow points which call for our decision in the present appeals In dealing with this controversy it is necessary to bear in mind some points on which there is no dispute The entries in the Seventh Schedule conferring legislative power on the legislatures in question must receive the widest denotation Entry of the Second List refers to taxes on goods and passengers carried by road or on inland waterways It is not on all goods and passengers that taxes can be imposed under this entry it is on goods and passengers carried by road or on inland waterways that taxes can be imposed Nevertheless it is obvious that the goods as such cannot pay taxes and so taxes levied on goods have to be recovered from some persons and these persons must have an intimate or direct connection or nexus with the goods before they can be called upon to pay the taxes in respect of the carried goods The other point on which there is no dispute before us is that the legislative power conferred on the appropriate legislatures to enact laws in respect of topics covered by several entries in the three Lists can be exercised both prospectively and retrospectively Where the legislature can make a valid law it may provide not only for the prospective operation of the material provisions of the said law but it can also provide for the retrospective operation of the said provisions Similarly there is no doubt that the legislative power in question includes the subsidiary or the auxiliary power to validate laws which have been found to be invalid If a law passed by a legislature is struck down by the Courts as being invalid for one infirmity or another it would be competent to the appropriate legislature to cure the said infirmity and pass a validating law so as to make the provisions of the said earlier law effective from the date when it was passed It is also true that though the <ORG> can pass a law and make its provisions retrospective it would be relevant to consider the effect of the said retrospective operation of the law both in respect of the legislative competence of the legislature and the reasonableness of the restrictions imposed by it In other words it may be open to a party affected by the provisions of the Act to contend that the retrospective operation of the Act so completely alters the character of the tax imposed by it as to take it outside the limits of the entry which gives the legislature competence to enact the law or it may be open to it to contend in the alternative that the restrictions imposed by the Act are so unreasonable that they should be struck down on the ground that they contravene his fundamental rights guaranteed under Art It is of course true that the power of taxing the people and their property is an essential attribute of the Government and Government may legitimately exercise the said power by reference to the objects to which it is applicable to the utmost extent to which Government thinks it expedient to do so The quantum of tax levied by the taxing statute the conditions subject to which it is levied the manner in which it is sought to be recovered are all matters within the competence of the legislature and in dealing with the contention raised by a citizen that the taxing statute contravenes Art Where for instance it appears that the taxing statute is plainly discriminatory or provides no procedural machinery for assessment and levy of the tax or that it is confiscatory It is in the light of these principles of law which are not in dispute between the parties before us that we must proceed to examine the arguments urged by Mr <NAME> in challenging the validity of the retrospective operation of the Act Mr <NAME> contends that one has merely to read the provisions of to realise that the character of the tax has been completely altered by its retrospective operation It would be recalled that inter alia provides that every passenger carried by a public service motor vehicle shall be liable to pay to the owner thereof the amount of tax payable under the said sub section because the scheme of the Act is that the tax is paid by the passenger to the owner and by the owner to the <ORG> and both these provisions are retroactive However in respect of passengers carried by the owner between and the date of the Act how can the owner recover the tax he is now bound to pay to the <ORG> asks Mr <NAME> Prima facie the argument appears to be attractive but a closer examination would show that the difficulty which the owner may experience in recovering the tax from the passengers will not necessarily alter the character of the tax In this connection we ought to bear in mind that the incidence of the tax should not be confused with the machinery adopted by the statute to recover the said tax <ORG>d generally it may not be unreasonable to assume that from the time when the Act of was brought into force it was known to all the owners that the legislature had imposed a tax in respect of passengers and goods carried by them and since then and particularly after the amendment of they may have raised their fares and freights to absorb their liability to pay the tax to the <ORG> But apart from that it seems to us that the nature of the tax in the present case is the same both in regard to prospective and retrospective operations and so it is difficult to entertain the argument that the tax has ceased to be a tax on passengers and is therefore outside Entry In this connection we cannot ignore the fact that prior to the passing of the impugned Act there was in operation a similar statute since April which was struck down as unconstitutional on the ground of want of assent of the President but it has no validity in challenging the legislative competence of <ORG> in that behalf We may in this connection incidentally refer to some decisions of this Court where a similar argument was urged in regard to the retrospective operation of some Acts It is well known that <NAME> made a pointed distinction between direct and indirect taxation and this distinction was reflected in of the British North America Act which gave to the Legislatures of the Provinces exclusive power to make laws in relation to direct taxation within the Province No such distinction can be made in regard to the legislative power conferred on the appropriate legislatures by the respective entries in the Seventh Schedule of our Constitution and so it is unnecessary for us to consider any argument based on the said distinction in the present case The position therefore appears to be well settled that if in its essential features a taxing statute is within the legislative competence of the legislature which passed it by reference to the relevant entry in the List its character is not necessarily changed merely by its retrospective operation so as to make the said retrospective operation outside the legislative competence of the said legislature and so we must hold that the That takes us to the question as to whether the restriction imposed on the appellants right under Art The same question arises in regard to the test of reasonableness prescribed by Art Mr <NAME> contends that since it is not disputed that the retrospective operation of a taxing statute is a relevant fact to consider in determining its reasonableness it may not be unfair to suggest that if the retrospective operation covers a long period like ten years it should be held to impose a restriction which is unreasonable and as such must be struck down as being unconstitutional In support of this plea Mr <NAME> has referred us to the observations made by <NAME> Basing himself on these observations Mr <NAME> contends that since the period covered by the retroactive operation of the Act is between April and September it should be held that the restrictions imposed by such retroactive operation are unreasonable and so the Act should be struck down in regard to its retrospective operation We do not think that such a mechanical test can be applied in determining the validity of the retrospective operation of the Act It is conceivable that cases may arise in which the retrospective operation of a taxing or other statute may introduce such an element of unreasonableness that the restrictions imposed by it may be open to serious challenge as unconstitutional but the test of the length of time covered by the retrospective operation cannot by itself necessarily be a decisive test On the other hand we may get cases where the period covered by the retrospective operation of the statue though long will not introduce any such infirmity If a statute passed by the legislature is challenged in proceedings before a <ORG> and the challenge is ultimately sustained and the statute is struck down it is not unlikely that the judicial proceedings may occupy a fairly long period and the legislature may well decide to await the final decision in the said proceedings before it uses its legislative power to cure the alleged infirmity in the earlier Act In such a case if after the final judicial verdict is pronounced in the matter the legislature passes a validating Act it may well cover a long period taken by the judicial proceedings in <ORG> and yet it would be inappropriate to hold that because the retrospective operation covers a long period therefore the restriction imposed by it is unreasonable That is why we think the test of the length of time covered by the retrospective operation cannot by itself be treated as a decisive test The earlier Act was passed in and came into force on April and the tax imposed by it was being collected until an order of injunction was passed in the two suits to which we have already referred The said suits were dismissed on May but the appeals preferred by the appellants were pending in this <ORG> until December It is however urged that the retrospective operation of the Act during the period covered by the orders of injunction issued by <ORG> in the said two suits must be held to be unreasonable and the argument is that in regard to the said period the retrospective operation should be struck down Similarly it is urged that the said retrospective operation should be struck down for the period between December when this Court struck down the earlier Act and August when Ordinance of was issued We do not think it would be appropriate in the present case to examine the validity of the retrospective operation by reference to particular periods of time covered by it in the manner suggested by Mr <NAME> and so we are not prepared to accept his argument that the retrospective operation of the Act is invalid so far as the period between December when the earlier Act was struck down by this Court and August when the Ordinance was issued is concerned Mr <NAME> contends that the two suits filed by the appellants and the passengers and the owners of goods respectively disclose a common design and can be treated as friendly suits actuated by the same motive and we do not think that this contention can be rejected as Wholly unjustified Apart from it when the injunction was issued against the respondent in the appellants suit the appellants gave an undertaking in writing to pay the taxes partyable on the fares and freights as provided by the law in case their suit failed We do not think that in the context the dismissal of the suit can legitimately refer to the final disposal of the appeal filed by the appellants before this Court In any event having regard to the agencies of the two suits the nature of the orders of Injunction issued in them and the character of the undertaking given by the appellants we do not think it would be possible to sustatain Mr <NAME> argument that for the period of the injunction the restrospective operation of the Act should be held to be invalid Along with the appellants <ORG> other bus owners had filed writ petitions challenging the validity of the Act These petitioners have not appealed to this Court presumably because their cases fall under the provisions of a of the Act It is likely that they had paid the amounts and since the amounts paid under the provisions of the earlier Act are now deemed to have been paid under the provisions of this Act they did not think it worthwhile to come to this Court against the decision of <ORG> Apart from that it is not unlikely that other bus owners may have made similar payments and the appellants have therefore come to this Court because they have made no payments and so their cases do not fail under a or may be their cases fall under The position therefore is that the retrospective operation of a cover respectively cases of payments actually made under the provisions of the earlier Act and cases pending inquiry and the retrospective operation of read with only applies to cases of persons who did not pay the tax during the whole of the period or whose cases were not pending and it is this limited class of persons whose interests are represented by the appellants before us Having regard to the somewhat unusual circumstances which furnish the background for the enactment of the impugned statute we do not think that we could accept Mr <NAME> argument that the retrospective operation of the Act imposes restrictions on the appellants which contravenue the provisions of Art There is only one more point to which reference must be made We have already noticed that <ORG> has rejected the argument urged on behalf of the <ORG> that the tax imposed by the Act is of a compensatory or regulatory character and therefore is valid He urged that according to the majority decision of this Court in the case of <ORG> it must now be taken to be settled that regulatory measures or measures imposing compensatory taxes for the use of trading facilities do not come within the purview of the restrictions contemplated by Article and such measures need not comply with the requirements of the proviso to Art On the other hand Mr <NAME> has argued that this doctrine of compensatory or regulatory or taxation which is mainly based on Australian decisions cannot be extended to the present case and he contends that if the doctrine of regulatory or compensatory taxes is very Part XIII contains provisions which constitute a self contained Ode and we need not really travel outside the said provision in determining the validity of the tax imposed by the Act Since we have come to the conclusion that the challenge to the validity of the retrospective operation of the Act cannot be sustained we do not think it necessary to pursue this matter any further
