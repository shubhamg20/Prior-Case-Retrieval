It is asserted that the defendants are using deceptively similarly decorated pencil and carton which are deceptively similar to It is also asserted that the cartons used by the defendants and the plaintiff are absolutely distinct and different and there is no similarity between the two What is required to be determined in this case is whether any copyright can exist in the subject matter in which the same That is to say whether there is any copyright in the printed cartons in which the pencils of the plaintiff and defendants are sold In order to determine whether copyright exists in the cartons it is necessary to keep in view the legally Section of the Copyright Act which deals with subject matter of copyright reads as under Copyright shall not subsist in any work specified sub section other than work to which the provisions of section gr Section apply unless i in the case of a published work the work is first published in India or where the work is first published outside India the In this case it is contended that the machine printed carton which are in question in which pencils are sold is covered by Section of the Copyright Act inasmuch as the carton is an original artistic work it is further contended that being a original artistic work copyright subsists therein and the plaintiff is entitled to sue for infringement of the copyright in the cartons A look at the plaintiff cartons also indicates that it contains the following words FROM The Makers Of Camel Art Materials Contents of this box marked with price A look at the carton of the defendant shows that in addition to the various colours printed thereon there are the following words printed on it <ORG> Hb Hexagonal Deluxe Pencils Product No It is clear that both the cartons are printed products produced by a printing machine My view that the carton is product of some kind of printing machine is strengthened by the fact that even in the plaint it is asserted the goods which are manufactured by the plaintiff are produced in very large quantities and the statement of sales of Camlin Flora Pencil indicate that pencil worth Rs What is therefore to be determined Is whether sufficient skill and labor has been expended upon the cartons boxes to enable it to be covered by Section of the Copyright Act Inasmuch as the only document which has been filed is the machine printed carton it must be taken that the document produced in <ORG> is the original and it has to be determined whether copyright can subsist therein under the Copyright Act it was said that there was a copyright in a label In that case it was contended by counsel for the plaintiff company that the <NAME> label is an artistic work within the meaning of Section of the Copyright Act Justice <NAME> who decided the case said that the label was an artistic work it appears to me that there was an admission in that It was stated by counsel for the plaintiff that carton in the instant suit was printed by Silk spinning process and look and feel of the carton The prints which are contemplated in that Section are the prints from an engraving like artistic works like lithography wood cuts etc The Court came to the conclusion that two designs in question were almost exactly similar It became obvious to me and it is now It is quite incredible that the result should have been reached in any other way and therefore the defendants design is a copy of the plaintiff design with merely trifling additions in addition to the different background done it would appear with the idea of trying to give the effect that it was somebody else effort It however appears from the observations which have been made by Justice <NAME> reproduced above that the original painting sketch drawing made by the plaintiff artist was produced in <ORG> of an original artistic work which comprised of copyrightable subject matter was relied upon by the plaintiff and filed in <ORG> A penis of the case indicates that the said passing off case was decided on the basis of concession made before the <ORG> A case decided on concession can not be of any assistance to the plaintiffs herein in any case that matter related to What was a design of bottle In that case it was conceded is apparent from what is stated at page that copyright subsisted in the <ORG> labels and that the plaintiff had the copyright in those labels There is no such concession in the instant case In <ORG> case there was no consideration of the question whether a mechanically reproduced label is by itself a good subject matter of copyright or not It appears to have been assumed in that case that there was in existence an original copyrighted design executed by an artist where in this case we have to proceed on the basis that the printed carton placed before the <ORG> is the only original Further even on the pencils there is no indication of claim to copyright whether with respect to the pattern on its skin or otherwise The reason for grant of injunction therein was because the bottle used by the plaintiff was of a shape which was copied by the defendants and the defendant bottle led to confusion between the defendants bottles and the plaintiffs bottlts The Court held It the mark is a drawing and Section i a expressly classifies drawings on proper subject matter of artistic copyright irrespective of artistic quality This case therefore does not help the counsel for the plaintiff as in the instant case what is before the <ORG> is a mechanically reproduced article and not the original article on which skill and labor of an artist has been expended found not to give any support to the contention which has been raised in this case that a mechanically printed carton is good subject matter of copyright The counsel for the plaintiff referred to Delhi at and particularly the passage at page in support of the proposition that a person who is the first user of the mark is entitled to a right therein The Mark in question there was Raja Rani and the prior use thereof was held to confer a right to restrain others from using it It does not give any support to the paintiff case that the words CAMLIN FLORA which are found in the carton are used by the defendants The words used by the defendants are inter alia NATIONAL ELORA There is dear distinction between CAMLIN FLORA and NATIONAL ELORA Another case cited by the counsel is page That case based upon a concession does not help the plaintiff as there is no such concession There is no force in this contention as the judgment does not say so This is so because the sine qua non to the existence of copyright is the expenditure of skill and labor on any work which originated from its author and unless the original work on which skill and labor has been expended by its author is produced in Court to prima facie show that the work has originated from an author it cannot be said that there is copyright in any work In <ORG> Supra there was no finding of fact that the matter ton the containers was a copyrightable artistic work and the case seems to have proceeded upon the copyright certificate only arid if that judgment can be said to say that what is printed on tins by a printing process Printing process essentially not involving any skill or labor of a natural person then I respectfully disagree from that judgment That case related to Trade and Merchandise Marks Act and the questions which were considered in that case related to assignment of copyright and vesting of copyright and the duration of copyrights The question decided in that case was not whether a mechanically reproduced printed paper carton can be said to be copyrightable I am of the view that a mechanically printed card board carton is not copyrightable there is no skill and labor involved in its production and It was next contended by the counsel for the plaintiff that the words FLORA and ELORA to be found on the respective cartons of the plaintiff and the defendants should be seen ant on an examination it would be seen that the attempt has been made to write the word ELORA in the same calligraphics style There is no doubt that the alphabet and alphabet in the plaintiff Flora as appearing on the carton of the plaintiff has been written in the same calligraphic style as the alphabet and in ELORA on the defendants carton Another reason why I am of the view that there is no passing off of the defendants cartons is that on the defendants carton very prominently printed is a famous sculpture of India Woman writing a letter it should be held that there is an attempt to pass off the goods It is also asserted by counsel that some colour combinations are used on the cartons I am of the view that the two cartons have different colour combinations and there are differences in the colour There are differences in the composition on the printed matter and therefore carton of the defendant cannot on the basis of similarity of colour combination be said to an attempt to pass off the defendants carton as cartons of the plaintiff No doubt it is so but this principle does not apply in this case as the difference in the cartons sufficiently distinguish the two cartons Mr <NAME> also asserts that the beginning of the words which are alleged to cause confusion are important and that the words have to be viewed as a whole and not merely some of its alphabets Mr <NAME> in reply said that the misspelling of the word Ellora as Ellora by the defendant and copying of the call graphical style of writing the alphabet and alphabet show an intention to deceive and to passing off I am of the view that there is no precedent binding on me to hold that a mechanically reproduced printed carton is capable of being subject matter of copyright As regards the contention of the plaintiff that defendants have attempted to pass of their cartons as cartons of the plaintiff I hold that taking into account the entirety of the carton its colour scheme the subject matter printed thereon and keeping view the similarities in the caligraphic style of the alphabets and and the apparent differences it can not be said that there is any likelihood of confusion between the cartons of the defendants and the cartons of the plaintiff as the differences mentioned earlier outweight the similarities IN view of what is stated herein above and in view of my finding that there is non copyrightable subject matter in mechanically produced printed cartons the only right being claimed in the suit being on the basis that the mechanically reproduced printed carton has copyrightable subject matter in it the instant suit for infringement of copyright is not maintainable In view of my findings not only the plajnliff are not entitled to the injunction which they have prayed for but they are not entitled to maintain the suit as brought and framed
