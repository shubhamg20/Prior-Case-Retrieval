The facts as stated in the order under revision show that the value of the property in dispute was perhaps more than Rs that court had no jurisdiction to hear the reference The <ORG> however on hearing the parties came to the view that the word competent means the competent court of territorial jurisdiction and Section of the will apply to suits and not to a proceeding and accordingly held that the objection was not tenable in law Before however I enter into the discussion of the question raised I think it is necessary to set out the relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure bearing on the subject If the Magistrate decides that one of the parties was or should under the second proviso to Sub section be treated as being in such possession of the said subject he shall issue an order declaring such party to be entitled to possession thereof until evicted therefrom in due course of law and forbidding all disturbance of such possession until such eviction and when he proceeds under the second proviso to Sub section may restore to possession the party forcibly and wrongfully dispossessed If the Magistrate is of opinion that none of the parties was then in such possession or is unable to decide as to which of them was then in such possession of the subject of dispute he may attach it and draw up a statement of the facts of the case and forward the record of the proceedings to a Civil Court of competent jurisdiction to decide the question whether any and which of the parties was in possession of the subject of dispute at the date of the order as explained in Sub section of Section and he shall direct the parties to appear before <ORG> on a date to be fixed by him These provisions in my opinion make it clear that notwithstanding the reference if any made to <ORG> for a finding on the point of possession the proceeding itself at no stage is ever transferred as a whole to the civil <ORG> so much so that on receipt of the opinion from <ORG> it is again the criminal <ORG> which finally disposes of that application Save in so far as is otherwise expressly provided nothing herein contained shall operate to give any Court jurisdiction over suits the amount or value of the subject matter of which exceeds the pecuniary limits if any of its ordinary jurisdiction This shows that the consideration of pecuniary jurisdiction in the case of jurisdiction oi <ORG> arises in the case of suits alone or at best for that reason in the case of tho proceedings which are in continuation of suits or arise therefrom but in no case in the case of those which are neither suits nor arise therefrom or are connected therewith Therefore in my opinion a reference made under Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure to <ORG> not being either a suit or a proceeding as held above cannot be put to any limitation of pecuniary jurisdiction nor there is any indication cither in that section or in Section of the Code of Civil Procedure in support of any construction like that That being so the contention raised in this case behalf of the petitioner that the learned Munsif to whom the reference was made is not competent to hear it fails The first four cases deal with the pecuniary jurisdiction of a <ORG> to which a decree is transferred for execution either under Section of the Code of Civil Procedure or some such similar provision provided in other Acts and the decision in those cases is broadly speaking based on the principle that the word suit as contemplated in Section of the Code of Civil Procedure is not limited only to the proceedings in cause up to the passing of the decree hut on the other hand covers all its proceedings including those in execution Therefore they are not of any assistance in disposing of the present case In the case reported in AIR All the reference made to <ORG> was by a revenue <ORG> and in those circumstances the question raised was whether the provision of the Code of Civil Procedure applied to that proceeding In answer thereto the learned Judges held that it was a proceeding of a character as contemplated under Section and therefore the procedure laid down in the Code of Civil Procedure did apply to it So the decision in that case is not based on the consideration of jurisdiction But unfortunately by the time the case came up for decision in the <ORG> <ORG> became functus officio in that matter and so the proceeding in the <ORG> had to be finally disposed of without any relief to the objector Yet in the course of discussion their Lordships expressed the view that the objection taken on the ground of pecuniary jurisdiction was a valid one But the discussion on this point is rather scanty and is based on the general proposition that the competency of a <ORG> consists both in territorial and pecuniary jurisdiction without any detailed discussion on the consideration as to whether the provisions of Section of the Code of Civil Procedure did at all apply to a case like that Therefore these cases do not throw any light on the point raised here Lastly our attention has also been drawn by the petitioners to the difficulties which may arise in cases where Civil <ORG> of different grades having the same territorial jurisdiction are found situated in the same area The section as it stands is silent on that point and this certainly may give rise to some unnecessary controversy But on the language as it stands at present it has to be held that in such cases all these <ORG> will have concurrent jurisdiction and in law the reference to any of them shall be a valid reference It is accordingly dismissed but in the circumstances of the case there will be no order as to costs In my opinion the question of pecuniary jurisdiction of <ORG> in order to make it <ORG> of competent jurisdiction within the meaning of Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure cannot reasonably arise The cases relied upon by learned counsel for the petitioner are all of them of a character which could be finally disposed of by <ORG> to which they were referred either for execution or under the Bengal Land Registration Act of or under the Revenue Law A finding by <ORG> on the dispute as to which party is in possession is again sent back to <ORG> which has to pass the final order There is yet another pertinent question of practical value It will in any case give rise to a new proceeding of an incidental character which may be open to challenge in a superior <ORG>
