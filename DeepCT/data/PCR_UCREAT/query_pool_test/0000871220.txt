Representations de futureo by public body if enforceable ex contractu by a person who acts upon such representation or promise intended to be acted on Burden of proof Degree of standard of proof in such cases HEADNOTE The appellant is a limited company which is primarily engaged in the business of manufacture and sale of sugar and it has a cold storage plant and a steel foundry With reference to a news item dated th October in <ORG> in which it was stated that the State of Uttar Pradesh had decided to give exemption from sales tax for a period of three years under section A of the Sales Tax Act to all new industrial units in the State with a view to enabling them to come on firm footing in developing stage the appellant addressed a letter dated th October to <NAME> stating that in view of the sales tax holiday announced by the <ORG> the appellant intended to set up a Hydrogenation plant for manufacture of <ORG> and sought for confirmation that this industrial unit which it proposed to set up would be entitled to sales tax holiday for a period of three years from the date it commenced production Thereafter when the appellant representative met the th respondent who was at that time the Chief Secretary to the <ORG> as also Advisor to the Governor and apprised the latter that the appellant was setting up the <ORG> factory solely on the basis of the assurance given on behalf of the <ORG> that the appellant would be entitled to exemption from sales tax for a period of three years from the date of commencement of commercial production at the factory the th respondent reiterated the assurance made The appellant in the meantime had submitted an application dated st December for a formal order granting exemption from sales tax under section A of the Sales Tax Act The appellant was also subsequently informed by the letter dated rd January of the th respondent categorically that the proposed <ORG> factory of the appellant will be entitled to exemption from Sales Tax for a period of three years from the date of going into production and that this will apply to all <ORG> sold during that period in Uttar Pradesh itself The appellant immediately by its letter dated th May pointed out to the th respondent that so far as the appellant was concerned <ORG> had already granted exemption from sales tax by the letter of the Chief Secretary dated rd January but still the appellant would be glad to send its representative to attend the meeting The appellant representative did attend the meeting held on rd June and reiterated that so far as the appellant was concerned it had already been granted exemption from sales tax and <ORG> stood committed to it <ORG> however went back upon the assurance and a letter dated th January was addressed by the th respondent intimating that the <ORG> had taken a policy decision that new <ORG> units in the State which go into commercial production by th September would be given only partial concession in Sales Tax at different rates on each year of production The factory of the appellant thereafter went into production from nd July and the appellant informed the Secretary to the <ORG> about the same by its letter dated rd July The appellant thereupon filed a writ petition in <ORG> asking for a writ directing <ORG> to exempt the sales of <ORG> manufactured by the appellant from Sales Tax for a period of three years commencing from nd January by issuing a notification under section A of the Sales Tax Act from the appellant for the said period of three years The view taken by <ORG> namely that even if there was an assurance given by the th respondent on behalf of <ORG> and such assurance was binding on <ORG> on the principle of promissory estoppel the appellant had waived its right under it by a accepting the concessional rates of sales tax set out in the letter of the th respondent dated th January is not correct No plea of waiver can be allowed to be raised unless it is pleaded and the factual foundation for it is laid in the pleadings In the instant case a the plea of waiver was not taken by <ORG> in the affidavit filed on its behalf in reply to the writ petition nor was it indicated even vaguely in such affidavit It was not right for <ORG> to have allowed the plea of waiver to be raised against the appellant and that plea should have been rejected in limine If waiver were properly pleaded in the affidavit in reply the appellant would have had an opportunity of placing on record facts showing why and in what circumstances the appellant came to address the letter dated th June and establishing that on those facts there was no waiver by the appellant of its right to exemption under the assurance given by the th respondent But in the absence of such pleading in the affidavit in reply this opportunity was denied to the appellant A In the instant case on the facts the plea of waiver could not be said to have been made out by <ORG> There was nothing to state that at the date when the appellant addressed the letter dated th June it had full knowledge of its right to exemption under the assurance given by the th respondent and that it intentionally abandoned such right It is not possible to presume in the absence of any material placed before the <ORG> that the appellant had full knowledge of its right to exemption so as to warrant an inference that the appellant waived such right by addressing the letter dated th June It is difficult to speculate what was the reason why the appellant addressed the letter th June stating that it would avail of the concessional rates of sales tax granted under the letter dated th January The doctrine called promissory estoppel equitable estoppel quasi estoppel and new estoppel is a principle evolved by equity to avoid injustice where a promise is made by a person knowing that it would be acted on and it is person to whom it is made and in fact it is so acted on and it is inequitable to allow the party making the promise to go back upon it The true principle of promissory estoppel is that where one party has by his words or conduct made to the other a clear and unequivocal promise which is intended to create legal relationship effect a legal relationship to arise in the future knowing or intending that it would be acted upon by the other party to whom the promise is made and it is infact so acted upon by the other party the promise would be binding on the party making it and he would not be entitled to go back upon it if it would be inequitable to allow him to do so having regard to the dealings which have taken place between the parties and this would be so irrespective whether there is any pre existing relationship between the parties or not Equity will in a given case where justice and fairness demand prevent a person from insisting on strict legal rights even where they arise not under any contract but on his own title deeds or under statute The parties need not be in any kind of legal relationship before the transaction from which the promissory estoppel take its origin The doctrine would apply even where there is no pre existing legal relationship between the parties but the promise is intended to create legal relations or affect a legal relationship whish will arise in future All CA quoted with approval It is an equitable principle evolved by the <ORG>s for doing justice and there is no reason why it should be given only a limited application by way of defence and it should only be a shield and not a sword to found a cause of action There is no qualitative difference between proprietary estoppel and promissory estoppel Both are the off springs of equity and if equity is flexible enough to permit proprietary estoppel to be used as a cause of action there is no reason in logic or principle why promissory estoppel should also not be available as cause of action if necessary to satisfy the equity Therefore despite the fact that allowing promissory estoppel to found a cause of action would seriously dilute the principle which requires consideration to support a contractual obligation this new principle which is a child of equity brought into the world with a view to promoting honesty and good faith and bringing law closer to justice should not be held in fetters but allowed to operate in all its activist magnitude so that it may fulfil the purpose for which was conceived and born A promise may in the United States derive contractual enforceability if it has been made by the promisor knowing or intending that it would be acted on and the promisee has altered his position in reliance on it notwithstanding that there is no consideration in the sense in which that word is used in English and <ORG> jurisprudence Under the English law the judicially formed view is that the crown is not immune from liability under the doctrine of promissory estoppel and the view taken by <NAME> in that the crown cannot escape its obligation under the doctrine of promissory estoppel by praying in aid the doctrine of executive necessity still holds the field The <ORG> would not be estopped by the acts of its officers and agents who without authority enter into agreements to do what the law does not sanction or permit and these dealing with an agent of the <ORG> must be held to have notice of limitations of his authority Where the <ORG> makes a promise knowing or intending that it would be acted on by the promisee and in fact the promisee acting in reliance on it alters his position the <ORG> would be held bound by the promise and the promise would be enforceable against the <ORG> at the instance of the promisee notwithstanding that there is no consideration for the promise and the promise is not recorded in the form of a formal contract as required by Article of the Constitution The <ORG> cannot be heard to say that it is under no obligation to act in a manner that is fair and just or that it is not bound by considerations of honesty and good faith Therefore it is not open to <ORG> to claim immunity from the applicability of the rule of promissory estopped and thereby repudiate a promise made by it on the ground that such promise may fetter its future executive action The doctrine of promissory estoppel would be displaced in such a case because on the facts equity would not require that the <ORG> should be held bound by the promise made by it A When the <ORG> is able to show that in view of the facts as they have transpired public interest would be prejudiced if the <ORG> were required to carry out the promise the <ORG> would have to balance the public interest in the <ORG> carrying out a promise made to a citizen which has induced the citizen to act upon it and alter his position and the public interest likely to suffer if the promise were required to be carried out by the <ORG> and determine which way the equity lies It would not be enough for the <ORG> just to say that public interest requires that the <ORG> should not be compelled to carry out the promise or that the public interest would suffer if the <ORG> were required to honour it A In order to resist its liability the <ORG> should disclose to the <ORG> the various events necessitating its claim to be exempt from the liability and it would be for the <ORG> to decide whether those events are such as to render it inequitable to enforce the liability against the <ORG> It is only if the <ORG> is satisfied on proper and adequate material placed by the <ORG> that over riding public interest requires that the <ORG> should not be held bound by the promise but should be free to act unfettered by it that the <ORG> would refuse to enforce the promise against the <ORG> But even where there is no such over riding public interest it may still be competent to the <ORG> to resile from the promise on giving reasonable notice which need not be a formal notice giving the promisee a reasonable opportunity of resuming his position provided of course it is possible for the promisee to restore status quo ante However this doctrine cannot be applied in teeth of an obligation or liability imposed by law It cannot be invoked to compel the <ORG> or even a private party to do an act prohibited by law The <ORG> can never be precluded from exercising its legislative function by resort to the doctrine of pro missory estoppel In order to attract the applicability of the doctrine of promissory estoppel it is not necessary that the promisee acting in reliance on the promise should suffer any deteriment If by deteriment is meant injustice to the promisee which would result if the promisor were to resile from his promisee then detriment would certainly come in as a necessary ingredient It is not necessary for the promisee to show that he has acted to his detriment All that he has to show is that he has acted to reliance on the promise and altered his position Grurldt <ORG> quoted with approval a The letter dated rd January was a representation on behalf of the <ORG> the representation having been made by the th respondent in his capacity as the Chief Secretary of the <ORG> categorically to the effect that the appellant would be entitled to exemption from sales tax in respect of the sale of vanaspati effected in Uttar Pradesh for a period of three years from the date of commencement of production This representation was made by way of clarification in view of the suggestion in the appellant letter dated nd January that the financial institutions were not prep ed to regard the earlier letter of the th respondent dated nd December as a definite commitment on the part of the <ORG> to grant exemption from sales tax A The representation made by the th respondent was a representation within the scope of his authority and was binding on the <ORG> in as much as the th respondent who was at the material time the Chief Secretary to the <ORG> and also Adviser to the Governor discharging the functions of the <ORG> during the President Rule had authority to bind the Governor Modi Rubber Ltd The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <ORG> This appeal by certificate raises a question of considerable importance in the field of public law How far and to what extent is the <ORG> bound by the doctrine of promissory estoppel It is a doctrine of comparatively recent origin but it is potentially so fruitful and pregnant with such vast possibilities for growth that traditional lawyers are alarmed lest it might upset existing doctrines which are looked upon almost reverentially and which have held the field for a long number of years The law in regard to promissory estoppel is not yet well settled though it has been the subject of considerable debate in England as well as the United <ORG>s of America and it has also received consideration in some recent decisions in India and we therefore propose to discuss it in some detail with a view to defining its contours and demarcating its parameters We will first state briefly the facts giving rise to this appeal The appellant is a limited company which is primarily engaged in the business of manufacture and sale of sugar and it has also a cold storage plant and a steel foundry On th October a news item appeared in <ORG> in which it was stated that the State of Uttar Pradesh had decided to give exemption from sales tax for a period of three years under section A of the Sales Tax Act to all new industrial units in the State with a view to enabling them to come on firm footing in developing stage The appellant on the basis of this announcement addressed a letter dated th October to the Director of Industries stating that in view of the sales tax holiday announced by the <ORG> the appellant intended to set up a Hydro genation Plant for manufacture of <ORG> and sought for confirmation that this industrial unit which it proposed to set up would be entitled to sales tax holiday for a period of three years from the date it commenced production On th December the appellant representative met the th respondent who was at that time the Chief Secretary to the <ORG> as also Advisor to the Governor and intimated to him that the appellant was setting up the <ORG> factory solely on the basis of the assurance given on behalf of the <ORG> that the appellant would be entitled to exemption from sales tax for a period of three years from the date of commencement of commercial production at the factory and the th respondent reiterated the assurance that the appellant would be entitled to sales tax holiday in case the <ORG> factory was put up by it The appellant by its letter dated th December placed on record what had transpired at the meeting on the previous day and requested the th respondent to please confirm that we shall be allowed sales tax holiday for a period of three years on the sale of <ORG> from the date we start production On the same day the appellant entered into an agreement with <ORG> Bombay for supply of plant and machinery for the <ORG> factory providing clearly that the appellant would have the option to terminate the agreement if within weeks exemption from sales tax was not granted by <ORG> The appellant had in the meantime submitted an application dated st December for a formal order granting exemption from sales tax under section A of the Act The appellant therefore addressed a letter dated nd January to the th respondent pointing out that the financial institutions were of the view that the letter of the th respondent dated nd December did not purport to commit the <ORG> for the concession mentioned and it was therefore necessary to obtain a formal order of exemption in terms of the application submitted by it The th respondent however stated categorically in his letter in reply dated rd January that the proposed <ORG> Factory of the appellant will be entitled to exemption from Sales Tax for a period of three years from the date of going into production and that this will apply to all <ORG> sold during that period in Uttar Pradesh itself and expressed his surprise that a letter from the Chief Secretary to <ORG> stating this fact in clear and unambiguous words should not carry conviction with the financial institutions The appellant by its letter dated th April advised the th respondent that <ORG> being convinced by the clear and categorical assurance given by the th respondent that the <ORG> Factory of the appellant would be entitled to exemption from sales tax for a period of three years from the date of commencement of production had sanctioned financial assistance to the appellant and the appellant was going ahead with the project in full speed to enable it to start production at the earliest The appellant made considerable progress in the setting up of the <ORG> Factory but it seems that by the middle of May <ORG> started having second thoughts on the question of exemption and a letter dated May was addressed by the th respondent who was Deputy Secretary to the <ORG> in <ORG> intimating that a meeting has been called by the Chief Minister on rd May to discuss the question of giving concession in Sales Tax on <ORG> products and requesting the appellant to attend the meeting The appellant immediately by its letter dated th May pointed out to the th respondent that so far as the appellant was concerned <ORG> had already granted exemption from Sales Tax by the letter of the Chief Secretary dated rd January but still the appellant would be glad to send its representative to attend the meeting as desired by the th respondent The appellant representative attended the meeting on that day and reiterated that so far as the appellant was concerned it had already been granted exemption from Sales Tax and <ORG> stood committed to it The appellant thereafter proceeded with the work of setting up the <ORG> plant on the basis that in accordance with the assurance given by the th respondent on behalf of <ORG> the appellant would be exempt from payment of Sales Tax for a period of three years from the date of commencement of production <ORG> however went back upon this assurance and a letter dated th January was addressed by the th respondent intimating that the Government had taken a policy decision that new Vanaspati Units in the State which go into commercial production by th September would be given partial concession in Sales Tax at the following rates for a period of three years First year of production Second year of production Third year of production The appellant by its letter dated th June pointed out to the Secretary to the Government that the appellant proposed to start commercial production of <ORG> with effect from st July and stated that as notified in the letter dated th January the appellant would be availing of the exemption granted by <ORG> and would be charging sales tax at the rate of instead of on the sales of <ORG> manufactured by it for a period of one year commencing from st July The factory of the appellant thereafter went into production from nd July and the appellant informed the Secretary to the Government about the same by its letter dated rd July The appellant thereupon filed a writ petition in <ORG> asking for a writ directing <ORG> to exempt the sales of <ORG> manufactured by the appellant from sales tax for a period of three years commencing from nd July by issuing a notification under section A and not to collect or charge sales tax from the appellant for the said period of three years It appears that in the writ petition as originally filed there was no plea of promissory estoppel taken against <ORG> and the writ petition was therefore amended by obtaining leave of <ORG> with a view to introducing the plea of promissory estoppel The appellant urged in the amended writ petition that the th respondent acting on behalf of <ORG> had given an unequivocal assurance to the appellant that the appellant would be entitled to exemption from payment of sales tax for a period of three years from the date of commencement of the production and this assurance was given by the th respondent intending or knowing that it would be acted on by the appellant and in fact the appellant acting in reliance on it established the <ORG> factory by investing a large amount and <ORG> was therefore bound to honour the assurance and exempt the <ORG> manufactured and sold by the appellant from payment of sales tax for a period of three years from nd July The appellant thereupon preferred the present appeal after obtaining a certificate of fitness from <ORG> The principal argument advanced on behalf of the appellant in support of the appeal was that the th respondent had given a categorical assurance on behalf of <ORG> that the appellant would be exempt from payment of sales tax for a period of three years from the date of commencement of production and such assurance was given intending or knowing that it would be acted on by the appellant and in fact the appellant acting in reliance on it altered its position and <ORG> was therefore bound on the principle of promissory estoppel to honour the assurance and exempt the appellant from sales tax for a period of three years from nd July being the date on which the factory of the appellant commenced production The appellant urged that waiver was a question of fact which was required to be pleaded and since no plea of waiver was raised in the affidavit filed on behalf of <ORG> in opposition to the writ petition it was not competent to <ORG> to rely on the plea of waiver for the first time at the hearing of the writ petition Even if the plea of waiver were allowed to be raised notwithstanding that it did not find place in the pleadings no waiver was made out said the appellant since there was nothing to show that were the circumstances in which the appellant had addressed the letter dated th June stating that it would avail of the exemption granted under the letter dated th January and it was not possible to say that the appellant with full knowledge of its right to claim total exemption from payment of sales tax waived that right and agreed to accept the concessional rates set out in the letter dated th January <ORG> on the other hand strongly pressed the plea of waiver and submitted that the appellant had clearly waived its right to complete exemption from payment of Sales Tax by addressing the letter dated th June <ORG> also contended that in any event even if there was no waiver the appellant was not entitled to enforce the assurance given by the th respondent since such assurance was not binding on <ORG> and more over in the absence of notification under section A <ORG> could not be prevented from enforcing the liability to sales tax imposed on the appellant under the provisions of the Act It was urged on behalf of <ORG> that there could be no promissory estoppel against <ORG> so as to inhibit it from formulating and implementing its policies in public interest These were broadly the rival contentions urged on behalf of the parties and we shall now proceed to consider them We shall first deal with the question of waiver since that can be disposed of in a few words <ORG> held that even if there was an assurance given by the th respondent on behalf of <ORG> and such assurance was binding on <ORG> on the principle of promissory estoppel the appellant had waived its right under it by accepting the concessional rates of sales tax set out in the letter of the th respondent dated th January No plea of waiver can be allowed to be raised unless it is pleaded and the factual foundation for it is laid in the pleadings Here it was common ground that the plea of waiver was not taken by <ORG> in the affidavit filed on its behalf in reply to the writ petition nor was it indicated even vaguely in such affidavit If waiver were properly pleaded in the affidavit in reply the appellant would have had an opportunity of placing on record facts showing why and in what circumstances the appellant came to address the letter dated th June and establishing that on these facts there was no waiver by the appellant of its right to exemption under the assurance given by the th respondent But in the absence of such pleading in the affidavit in reply this opportunity was denied to the appellant It was therefore not right for <ORG> to have allowed the plea of waiver to be raised against the appellant and that plea should have been rejected in limine It is pointed out in Halsbury Laws of England Volume in paragraph at page that for a waiver to be effectual it is essential that the person granting it should be fully informed as to his rights and <NAME> delivering the judgment of <ORG> in <NAME> <ORG> has also emphasised that waiver must be with knowledge an essential supported by many authorities Now in the present case there is nothing to show that at the date when the appellant addressed the letter dated th June it had full knowledge of its right to exemption under the assurance given by the th respondent and that it intentionally abandoned such right It is difficult to speculate what was the reason why the appellant addressed the letter dated th June stating that it would avail of the concessional rates of sales tax granted under the letter dated th January It is possible that the appellant might have thought that since no notification exempting the appellant from sales tax had been issued by <ORG> under section A the appellant was legally not entitled to exemption and that is why the appellant might have chosen to accept whatever concession was being granted by <ORG> The claim of the appellant to exemption could be sustained only on the doctrine of promissory estoppel and this doctrine could not be said to be so well defined in its scope and ambit and so free from uncertainty in its application that we should be compelled to hold that the appellant must have had knowledge of its right to exemption on the basis of promissory estoppel at the time when it addressed the letter dated th June In fact in the petition as originally filed the right to claim total exemption from sales tax was not based on the plea of promissory estoppel which was introduced only by way of amendment Moreover it must be remembered that there is no presumption that every person knows the law It is often said that every one is presumed to know the law but that is not a correct statement there is no such maxim known to the law Over a hundred and thirty years ago <NAME> pointed out in <NAME> <NAME> There is no presumption in this country that every person knows the law it would be contrary to common sense and reason if it were so There is the rule that ignorance of the law does not excuse a maxim of very different scope and application It is therefore not possible to presume in the absence of any material placed before the <ORG> that the appellant had full knowledge of its right to exemption so as to warrant an inference that the appellant waived such right by addressing the letter dated th June We accordingly reject the plea of waiver raised on behalf of <ORG> That takes us to the question whether the assurance given by the th respondent on behalf of <ORG> that the appellant would be exempt from sales tax for a period of three years from the date of commencement of production could be enforced against <ORG> by invoking the doctrine of promissory estoppel It is a principle evolved by equity to avoid injustice and though commonly named promissory estoppel it is as we shall presently point out neither in the realm of contract nor in the realm of estoppel It is interesting to trace the evolution of this doctrine in England and to refer to some of the English decisions in order to appreciate the true scope and ambit of the doctrine particularly because it has been the subject of considerable recent development and is steadily expanding Lord <NAME> stated the doctrine in its earliest form it has undergone considerable development since then in the following words in <NAME> <ORG> supra It is the first principle upon which all Courts of Equity proceed that if parties who have entered into definite and distinct terms involving certain legal results afterwards by their own act or with their own consent enter upon a course of negotiation which has the effect of leading one of the parties to suppose that the strict rights arising under the contract will not be enforced or will be kept in suspense or held in abeyance the person who otherwise might have enforced those rights will not be allowed to enforce them where it would be inequitable having regard to the dealings which have thus taken place between the parties This principle of equity laid down by Lord <NAME> made sporadic appearances in stray cases now and then but it was only in that it was disinterred and restated as a recognised doctrine by Mr Justice <NAME> as he then was in the High Trees case supra The facts in that case were as follows The plaintiffs leased to the defendents a subsidiary of the plaintiffs in a block of flats for years at a rent of a year The plaintiffs agreed at the request of the defendants to reduce the rent to The claim was allowed because the court took the view that the period for which the full rent was claimed fell out side the representation but Mr Justice <NAME> as he then was considered <NAME> whether the plaintiffs could have recovered the covenanted rent for the whole period of the lease and observed that in equity the plaintiffs could not have been allowed to act inconsistently with their promise on which the defendants had acted It was pressed upon the <ORG> that according to the well settled law as laid down in Jorden Money no estoppel could be raised against plaintiffs since the doctrine of estoppel by representation is applicable only to representations as to some state of facts alleged to be at the time actually in existence and not to promises de futuro which if binding at all must be binding only as contracts and here there was no representa tion of an existing state of facts by the plaintiffs but it was merely a promise or representation of intention to act in a particular manner in the future They are cases in which a promise was made which was intended to create legal relations and which to the knowledge of the person making the promise was going to be acted on by the person to whom it was made and which was in fact so acted on Ten years later <ORG> also used the same terminology in <ORG> <ORG> and <ORG> supra that If persons who have contractual rights against others induce by their conduct those against whom they have such rights to believe In fact <NAME> <NAME> pointed out in <ORG> <ORG> Lord <NAME> in his enunciation of the principle assumed a pre existing contractual relationship between the parties but this does not seem to me to be essential provided that there is a pre existing legal relationship which could in certain circumstances give rise to liabilities and penalties But even this limitation suggested by <NAME> <NAME> that there should be a pre existing legal relationship which could in certain circumstances give rise to liabilities and penalties is not warranted and it is significant that the statement of the doctrine by Mr Justice <NAME> in the High Trees case does not contain any such limitation The learned Judge has consistently refused to introduce any such limitation in the doctrine and while sitting in <ORG> he said in so many terms in <NAME> <ORG> Counsel for the appellant referred us however to the second edition of <NAME> book on Estoppel by Representation pp I do not think it is so limited see <ORG> <ORG> It applies whenever a representation is made whether of fact or law present or future which is intended to be binding intended to induce a person to act on it and he does act on it This observation of Lord <NAME> clearly suggest that the parties need not be in any kind of legal relationship before the transaction from which the promissory estoppel takes its origin The doctrine would seem to apply even where there is no pre existing legal relationship between the parties but the promise is intended to create legal relations or affect a legal relationship which will arise in future Of course it must be pointed out in fairness to Lord <NAME> that he made it clear in the High Trees case that the doctrine of promissory estoppel cannot found a cause of action in itself since it can never do away with the necessity of consideration in the formation of a contract but he totally repudiated in <NAME> case the necessity of a pre existing relationship between the parties and pointed out in <NAME> Arun District Council that equity will in a given case where justice and fairness demand prevent a person from insisting on strict legal rights even where they arise not under any contract but on his own title deeds or under statue The true principle of promissory estoppel therefore seems to be that where one party has by his words or conduct made to the other a clear and unequivocal promise which is intended to create legal relations or affect a legal relationship to arise in the future knowing or intending that it would be acted upon by the other party to whom the promise is made and it is in fact so acted upon by the other party the promise would be binding on the party making it and he would not be entitled to go back upon it if it would be inequitable to allow him to do so having regard to the dealings which have taken place between the parties and this would be so irrespective whether there is any preexisting relationship between the parties or not It may be pointed out that in England the law has been well settled for a long time though there is some indication of a contrary trend to be found in recent juristic thinking in that country that promissory estoppel cannot itself be the basis of an action The ghost of traditional estoppel continues to haunt this new doctrine and that is why we find that while boldly formulating and applying this new equity in the High Trees case Lord <NAME> added a qualification that though in the circumstances set out the promise would undoubtedly be held by the courts to be binding on the party making it notwithstanding that under the old common law it might be difficult to find any consideration for it the courts have not gone so far as to give a cause of action in damages for the breach of such a promise but they have refused to allow the party making it to act inconsistently with it That principle does not create new causes of action where none existed before It only prevents a party from insisting upon his strict legal rights when it would be unjust to allow him to enforce them having regard to the dealings which have taken place between the parties So also said <NAME> in the more recent case of <NAME> <ORG> The doctrine may afford a defence against the enforcement or otherwise of enforceable rights it cannot create a cause of action It is however necessary to make it clear that though this doctrine has been called in various judgments and text books as promissory estoppel and it has been variously described as equitable estoppel quasi estoppel and new estoppel it is not really based on the principle of estoppel but it is a doctrine evolved by equity in order to prevent injustice where a promise is made by a person knowing that it would be acted on by the person to whom it is made and in fact it is so acted on and it is inequitable to allow the party making the promise to go back upon it They are really promises promises intended to be binding intended to be acted upon and in fact acted upon It is an equitable principle evolved by the courts for doing justice and there is no reason why it should be given only a limited application by way of defence It may be noted that even Lord <NAME> recognised in <NAME> Arun Distric Council supra that there are estoppels and estoppels Some don and added that in the species of estoppel called proprietary estoppel it does give rise to a cause of action The learned Law Lord after quoting what he had said in <ORG> Twitchings namely that the effect of estoppel on the true owner may be that his own title to the property be it land or goods has been held to be limited or extinguished and new rights and interests have been created therein Proceeded to observe that the new rights and interests so created by estoppel in or over land will be protected by the courts and in this way give rise to a cause of action But if we look at the judgments of Lord <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> it is apparent that they did not base their decision on any distinctive feature of proprietary estoppel but proceeded on the assumption that there was no distinction between promissory and proprietary estoppel so far as the problem before them was concerned Lord <NAME> referring to what Lord <NAME> had said in <NAME> <ORG> a decision from which inspiration was drawn by him for evolving the doctrine of promissory estoppel in the High Tree case observed that it is the first principle on which all courts of equity proceed that it will prevent person from insisting on his strict legal rights whether arising under a contract or on his title deeds or by statute when it would be inequitable for him to do so having regard to the dealings which have taken place between the parties <NAME> <NAME> also observed that in pursuing the inquiry as to whether there was an equity in favour of <NAME> he did not find helpful the distinction between promissory and proprietary estoppel He added that this distinction may indeed be valuable to those who have to teach or expound the law but I do not think that in solving the particular problem raised by a particular case putting the law into categories is of the slightest assistance The representative of <ORG> clearly gave assurance to <NAME> that they would give him access to the new road at point to serve the southern portion of his land and <ORG> in fact constructed a gate at point and in the belief induced by this representation that he would have right of access to the new road at point <NAME> agreed to sell the northern portion of his land without reserving for himself as owner of the southern portion any right of way over the northern portion for the purpose of access to the new road This was the reason why the Court raised an equity in favour of <NAME> and held that the equity would be satisfied by giving <NAME> the right of access at point free of charge without paying anything for it <ORG> was held bound by its promise to provide <NAME> access to the new road at point and this promise was enforced against <ORG> at the instance of <NAME> The case was one which fell within the category of promissory estoppel and it may be regarded as supporting the view that promissory estoppel can be the basis of a cause of action It is possible that the case also came within the rule of proprietary estoppel enunciated by Lord <NAME> in <NAME> Dyson The rule of law applicable to the case appears to me to be this If a man under a verbal agreement with a landlord for a certain interest in land or what amounts to the same thing under an expectation created or encouraged by the landlord that he shall have a certain interest takes possession of such land with the consent of the landlord and upon the faith of such promise or expectation with the knowledge of the land lord and without objection by him lays out money upon the land <ORG> will compel the landlord to give effect to such promise or expectation and <NAME> and <NAME> may be right in observing that that was perhaps the reason why it was held that the promise made by Arun District Council gave rise to a cause of action in favour of <NAME> If proprietary estoppel can furnish a cause of action why should promissory estoppel not There is no qualitative difference between the two Both are the off springs of equity and if equity is flexible enough to permit proprietary estoppel to be used as a cause of action there is no reason in logic or principle why promissory estoppel should also not be available as a cause of action if necessary to satisfy the equity The learned authors have also observed at page that to give a plaintiff a cause of action on a promissory estoppel must be little less than to allow an action in contract where consideration is not shown and that cannot be done because consideration still remains a cardinal necessity of the formation of a contract It can hardly be disputed that over the last three or four centuries the doctrine of consideration has come to occupy such a predominant position in the law of contract that under the English law it is impossible to think of a contract without consideration and therefore it is understandable that the English courts should have hesitated to push the doctrine of promissory estoppel to its logical conclusion and stopped short at allowing it to be used merely as a weapon of defence though as we shall point out there are quite a few cases where this doctrine has been used not as founding a cause of action in itself but as a part of a cause of a action The modern attitude towards the doctrine of consideration is however changing fast and there is considerable body of juristic thought which believes that this doctrine is something of an anchronism <NAME> pointed out long ago in his History of English Law that the requirements of consideration in its present shape prevent the enforcement of many contracts which ought to be enforced if the law really wishes to give effect to the lawful intentions of the parties to them and it would prevent the enforcement of many others if the judges had not used their ingenuity to invest considerations Lord <NAME> observed in the well known case of <ORG> <ORG> I confess that this case is to my mind apt to nip any budding affection which one might have had for the doctrine of consideration For the effect of that doctrine in the present case is to make it possible for a person to snap his fingers at a bargain deliberately made a bargain not in itself unfair and which the person seeking to enforce it has a legitimate interest to enforce We do not see any valid reason why promissory estoppel should not be allowed to found a cause of action where in order to satisfy the equity it is necessary to do so Two such cases are <NAME> Minister of Pensions and <NAME> <ORG> The English courts have thus gone a step forward from the original position when promissory estoppel was regarded merely as a passive equity and allowed it to be used as a weapon of offence to a limited extent as a part of the cause of action but still the doctrine of consideration continues to inhibit the judicial mind and that has thwarted the full development of this new equitable principle and the realisation of its vast potential as a juristic technique for doing justice It is true that to allow promissory estoppel to found a cause of action would seriously dilute the principle which requires consideration to support a contractual obligation but that is no reason why this new principle which is a child of equity brought into the world with a view to promoting honesty and good faith and bringing law closer to justice should be held in fetters and not allowed to operate in all the activist magnitude so that it may fulfil the purpose for which it was conceived and born We would do well to recall the famous words uttered by Mr Justice <NAME> while closing his first lecture on Paradoxes of Legal Science The disparity between precedent and ethos may so lengthen with the years that only covin and chicenery would be disappointed if the separation were to end There are many intermediate stages mores if inadequate to obliterate the past may fix direction for the future <NAME> <ORG> We may profitably consider at this stage what the American law on the subject is because in the United States the law has always shown a greater capacity for adjustment and growth than elsewhere It is true that the Restatement has not the same weight as a source of law as actual decisions of courts of high standing yet the principle set out in Article has in fact formed the basis of a number of decisions in various states and it is now becoming increasingly clear that a promise may in the United States derive contractual enforceability if it has been made by the promisor intending that it would be acted on and the promisee has altered his position in reliance on it notwithstanding that there is no consideration in the sense in which that word is used in English and Commonwealth jurisprudence There are numerous examples of the application of this principle to be found in recent American decisions There is for instance the long line of cases in which a promise to give a charitable subscription has been consistently held to be enforceable at the suit of the charity We held the promise binding though consideration there was none except upon the theory of a promissory estoppel Decisions which have stood so long and which are supported by so many considerations of public policy and reason will not be over ruled to save the symmetry of a concept which itself came into our law not so much from any reasoned conviction of its justice as from historical accidents of practice and procedure The most notable instances are to be found in what may be called the sub contractor bid cases in which a contractor about to tender for a contract invites a sub contractor to submit a bid for a sub contract and after receiving his bid the contractor submits a tender It is not possible to say that any detriment which the contractor may be able to show in these cases would amount to consideration in its strict sense and these decisions have plainly been reached on an application of the doctrine of promissory estoppel There are also numerous cases where the doctrine of promissory estoppel has been applied against the Government where the interest of justice morality and common fairness clearly dictated such a course We shall refer to these cases when we discuss the applicability of the doctrine of equitable estoppel against the Government Suffice it to state for the present that the doctrine of promissory estoppel has been taken much further in the United States than in English and Commonwealth jurisdictions and in some States at least it has been used to reduce if not to destroy the prestige of consideration as an essential of valid contract <NAME> in an early decision in <ORG> The King held that an undertaking given by <ORG> to certain neutral ship owners during the First World War that if the shipowners sent a particular ship to the United Kingdom with a specified cargo she shall not be detained was not enforceable against <ORG> in a court of law and observed that his main reason for taking this view was that it is not competent for the <ORG> to fetter its future executive action which must necessarily be determined by the needs of the community when the question arises It cannot by contract hamper its freedom of action in matters which concern the welfare of the <ORG> Nor can the <ORG> escape by praying in aid the doctrine of executive necessity that is the doctrine that the <ORG> cannot bind itself so as to fetter its future executive action That doctrine was propounded by <NAME> in <ORG> The King but it was unnecessary for the decision because the statement there was not a promise which was intended to be binding but only an expression of intention It only avails the <ORG> where there is an implied term to that effect or that is the true meaning of the contract The courts in America for a long time took the view that the doctrine of promissory estoppel does not apply to the <ORG> but more recently the courts have started retreating from that position to a sounder one namely that the doctrine of promissory estoppel may apply to the <ORG> when justice so requires Later in the same paragraph it is stated that as a general rule the doctrine of estoppel will not be applied against the <ORG> in its governmental public or sovereign capacity but a qualification is introduced that promissory estoppel may be applied against the <ORG> even in its governmental public or sovereign capacity if its application is necessary to prevent fraud or manifest injustice Since there is an increasing trend towards applying the doctrine of promissory estoppel against the <ORG> and the old law that promissory estoppel does not apply against the government is definitely declining On winter wheat acreage was insurable and acting upon it the respondents made an application for insurance which was forwarded by <ORG> to the Denver office of the <ORG> with a recommendation for acceptance There were at this time wheat crop insurance regulations framed by the <ORG> and published in <ORG> which prohibited insurance of spring wheat reseeded on winter wheat acreage but neither the respondents nor <ORG>s which was acting as the agent of the <ORG> was aware of them A few months later most of the respondent crop was destroyed by drought and on a claim being made by the respondents under the policy of insurance the <ORG> refused to pay the loss on the ground that the wheat crop insurance regulations expressly prohibited insurance of reseeded wheat The majority observed It is too late in the day to urge that the Government is just another private litigant for purposes of charging it with liability whenever it takes over a business theretofore conducted by private enterprises or engages in competitions with private ventures Whatever the form in which the Government functions anyone entering into an arrangement with the Government takes the risk of having accurately ascertained that be who purports to act for the Government stays within the bounds of his authority And this is so even though as here the agent himself may have been unaware of the limitations upon his autho rity Man must turn square corners when they deal with the Government does not reflect a callous outlook It merely expresses the duty of all courts to observe the conditions defined by <ORG> for charging the public treasury It will be seen that the <ORG> was held entitled to repudiate its liability because the wheat crop insurance regulations prohibited insurance of reseeded wheat and the assurance given by <ORG> as the agent of the <ORG> that the reseeded wheat was insurable being contrary to the wheat crop insurance regulations could not be held binding on the <ORG> Referring to the observation of the majority that Men must turn square corners when they deal with the Government <NAME> and <NAME> have poetically responded by saying It is hard to see why the Government should not be held to a like standard of rectangular rectitude when dealing with its citizens There has so far not been any decision of <ORG> of the United <ORG>s taking the view that the doctrine of promissory estoppel cannot be invoked against the <ORG> Of course as pointed out by the United <ORG>s Court of Appeals <ORG> in <NAME> United <ORG>s the <ORG> would not be estopped by the acts of its officers and agents who without authority enter into agreements to do what the law does not sanction or permit and those dealing with an agent of the <ORG> must be held to have notice of limitations of his authority as held in <NAME> case This is precisely what <ORG> also held in England in <NAME> <ORG> supra where Lord <NAME> stated the law to be The illegality of an act is the same whether or not the actor has been misled by an assumption of authority on the part of a <ORG> officer however high or low in the hierachy The question is whether the character of an act done in face of a statutory prohibition is affected by the fact that it has been induced by a misleading assumption of authority The Municipal Commissioner replied that the markets were vested in <ORG> but that he was willing to vacate certain municipal stables which occupied a portion of the proposed site if the Government would rent other land mentioned in his letter to the <ORG> at a nominal rent the <ORG> undertaking to bear the expenses of levelling the same and permit the <ORG> to erect on such land stables of wood and iron with nobble foundation to be removed at six months notice on other suitable ground being provided by Government The Government accepted the suggestion of <ORG> and sanctioned the application of <ORG> for a site for stabling on the terms set out above and <ORG> thereafter entered into possession of the land and constructed stables workshops and chawls on the same at considerable expense <ORG> declined to hand over possession of the land or to pay the higher rent and the Secretary of State for India thereupon filed a suit against <ORG> for a declaration that the tenancy of the <ORG> stood determined and for an order directing the municipality to pay rent at the rate of Rs The suit was resisted by <ORG> on the ground then the events which had transpired had created an equity in favour of the <ORG> which afforded an answer to the claim of the Government to eject the <ORG> This defence was upheld by <ORG> of <ORG> and <NAME> speaking on behalf of <ORG> pointed out that in view of the following facts namely the <ORG> gave up the old stables levelled the ground and erected the moveable staibles in in the belief that they had against the Government an absolute right not to be turned out until not only the expiration of six months notice but also other suitable ground was furnished that this belief is referable to an expectation created by the Government that their enjoyment of the land would be in accordance with this belief and that the Government knew that the <ORG> were acting in this belief so created an equity was created in favour of the Municipality which entitled it to appeal to the Court for its aid in assisting them to resist the Secretary of State claim that they shall be ejected from the ground The learned Chief Justice pointed out that the doctrine which he was applying took its origin from the jurisdiction assumed by Courts of Equity to intervene in the case of or to prevent fraud and after referring to <NAME> Dyson observed that the <ORG> also came within the range of this equity This decision of <ORG> is a clear authority for the proposition that it is open to a party who has acted on a representation made by the <ORG> to claim that the <ORG> shall be bound to carry out the promise made by it even though the promise is not recorded in the form of a formal contract as required by the Constitution The facts giving rise to this case were that in <ORG> called upon the predecessor in title of <ORG> to remove old markets from a certain site and vacate it and on the application of the Municipal Commissioner the <ORG> passed a resolution approving and authorizing the grant of another site to the Municipality The resolution stated further that the <ORG> do not consider that any rent should be charged to the Municipality as the markets will be like other public buildings for the benefit of the whole community In the Collector of Bombay assessed the new site to land revenue and <ORG> there upon filed a suit for a declaration that the order of assessment was ultra vires and it was entitled to hold the land for ever without payment of any assessment <ORG> held that the <ORG> had lost its right to assess the land in question by reason of the equity arising on the facts of the case in favour of <ORG> and there was thus a limitation on the right of the <ORG> to assess under section of the Bom bay City Land Revenue Act On appeal by the Collector to this Court the majority Judges held that the <ORG> was not under the circumstances of the case entitled to assess land revenue on the land in question because <ORG> had taken possession of the land in terms of the <ORG> resolution and had continued in such possession openly uninterruptedly and of right for over seventy years and thereby acquired the limited title it had been prescribing for during the period that is to say the right to hold the land in perpetuity free of rent <NAME> agreed with the conclusion reached by the majority but rested his decision on the doctrine of promissory estoppel He pointed out that the <ORG> could not be allowed to go back on the representation made by it and stressed the point in the form of an interrogation by asking if we do so would it not amount to our countenancing the perpetration of what can be compendiously described as legal fraud which a court of equity must prevent being committed He observed that even if the resolution of the <ORG> amounted merely to the holding out of a promise that no rent will be charged in the future the <ORG> must be deemed in the circumstances of this case to have bound themselves to fulfil it Whether it is the equity recognised in <NAME> case supra or it is some other form of equity is not of much importance Courts must do justice by the promotion of honesty and good faith as far as it lies in their power Then we come to the celebrated decision of this <ORG> in the <ORG> case supra We may briefly state the facts in order to appreciate the ratio of the decision The respondents contended that relying on the promise contained in the Scheme they had exported woollen goods to Afghanistan and were This contention was sought to be answered on behalf of the Government by pleading the doctrine of executive necessity and the argument of the Government based on this doctrine was that it is not competent for the Government to fetter its future executive action which must necessarily be determined by the needs of the community when the question arises and no promise or undertaking can be held to be binding on the Government so as to hamper its freedom of executive action We have already referred to these observations earlier and we need not reproduce them over again These observation undoubtedly supported the contention of the Government but it was pointed out by this <ORG> that these observations were disapproved by <NAME> in <NAME> Minister of Pensions supra where the learned Judge said that the <ORG> cannot escape by praying in aid the doctrine of executive necessity that is the doctrine that the <ORG> cannot bind itself so as to fetter its future executive action It only avails the <ORG> where there is an implied term to that effect or that is the true meaning of the contract and this statement of <NAME> was to be preferred as laying down the correct law of the subject <NAME> speaking on behalf of the <ORG> observed at We are unable to accede to the contention that the executive necessity releases the <ORG> from honouring its solemn promises relying on which citizens have acted to their detriment Under our constitutional set up no person may be deprived of his right or liberty except in due course of and by authority of law of a member of the <ORG> seeks to deprive a citizen of his right or liberty otherwise than in exercise of power derived from the law common or statute the <ORG> will be competent to and indeed would be bound to protect the rights of the aggrieved citizen The defence of executive necessity was thus clearly negatived by this Court and it was pointed out that it did not release the Government from its obligation to honour the promise made by it if the citizen acting in reliance on the promise had altered his position It was also contended on behalf of the Government that if the Government were held bound by every representation made by it regarding its intention when the exporters have acted in the manner they were invited to act the result would be that the Government would be bound by a contractual obligation even though no formal contract in the manner required by Article was executed But this contention was negatived and it was pointed out by this Court that the respondents are not seeking to enforce any contractual right they are seeking to enforce compliance with the obligation which is laid upon the Textile Commissioner by the terms of the Scheme and we are of the view that even if the Scheme is executive in character the respondents who were aggrieved because of the failure to carry out the terms of the Scheme were entitled to seek resort to the Court and claim that the obligation imposed upon the Textile Commissioner by the Scheme be ordered to be carried out It was thus laid down that a party who has acting in reliance on a promise made by the Government altered his position is entitled to enforce the promise against the Government even though the promise is not in the form of a formal contract as required by Article and that Article does not militate against the applicability of the doctrine of promissory estoppel against the Government supra summed up the position as follows Under our jurisprudence the Government is not exempt from liability to carry out the representation made by it as to its future conduct and it cannot on some undefined and undisclosed ground of necessity or expediency fail to carry out the promise solemnly made by it nor claim to be the Judge of its own obligation to the citizen on an ex parte appraisement of the circumstances in which the obligation has arisen The law may therefore now be taken to be settled as a result of this decision that where the <ORG> makes a promise knowing or intending that it would be acted on by the promises and in fact the promisee acting in reliance on it alters his position the <ORG> would be held bound by the promise and the promise would be enforceable against the <ORG> at the instance of the promises notwithstanding that there is no consideration for the promise and the promise is not recorded in the form of a formal contract as required by Article of the Constitution Can the <ORG> say that it is under no obligation to act in a manner that is fair and just or that it is not bound by considerations of honesty and good faith Why should the <ORG> not be held to a high standard of rectangular rectitude while dealing with its citizens There was a time when the doctrine of executive necessity was regarded as sufficient justification for the <ORG> to repudiate even its contractual obligations but let it be said to the eternal glory of this Court this doctrine was emphatically negatived in the Indo Afghan Agencies case and the supremacy of the rule of law was established It was laid down by this Court that the <ORG> cannot claim to be immune from the applicability of the rule of promissory estoppel and repudiate a promise made by it on the ground that such promise may fetter its future executive action But if the <ORG> makes such a promise and the promises acts in reliance upon it and alters his position there is no reason why the <ORG> should not be compelled to make good such promise like any other private individual The doctrine of promissory estoppel would be displaced in such a case because on the facts equity would not require that the <ORG> should be held bound by the promise made by it When the <ORG> is able to show that in view of the facts as have transpired public interest would be prejudiced if the <ORG> were required to carry out the promise the <ORG> would have to balance the public interest in the <ORG> carrying out a promise made to a citizen which has induced the citizen to act upon it and after this position and the public interest likely to suffer if the promise were required to be carried out by the <ORG> and determine which way the equity lies It would not be enough for the <ORG> just to say that public interest requires that the <ORG> should not be compelled to carry out the promise or that the public interest would suffer if the <ORG> were required to honour it If the <ORG> wants to resist the liability it will have to disclose to the <ORG> what are the facts and circumstances on account of which the <ORG> claims to be exempt from the liability and it would be for the <ORG> to decide whether these facts and circumstances are such as to render it inequitable to enforce the liability against the <ORG> It is only if the <ORG> is satisfied on proper and adequate material placed by the <ORG> the over riding public interest requires that the <ORG> should not be held bound by the promise but should be free to act unfettered by it that the <ORG> would refuse to enforce the promise against the <ORG> But even where there is no such over riding public interest it may still be competent to the <ORG> to resile from the promise on giving reasonable notice which need not be a formal notice giving the promisee a reasonable opportunity of resuming his position provided of course it is possible for the promisee to restore status quo ante The question which arose in this case was whether <ORG> could be compelled to carry out a promise made by its predecessor municipality that the factories in the industrial area within its jurisdiction would be exempt from payment of octroi for seven years from the date of the levy The appellant company thereupon filed a writ petition under Article of the Constitution in the High <ORG> of Bombay to restrain the municipal council from enforcing the levy of octroi duty in breach of the promise made by the predecessor municipality The High <ORG> dismissed the petition in limine but on appeal this <ORG> took the view that this was a case which required consideration and should have been admitted by the High <ORG> <NAME> <NAME> speaking on behalf of the <ORG> pointed out Public bodies are as much bound as private individuals to carry out representations of facts and promises made by them relying on which other persons have altered their position to their prejudice The obligation arising against an individual out of his representation amounting to a promise may be enforced ex contracted by a person who acts upon the promise when the law requires that a contract enforceable at law against a public body shall be in certain from or be executed in the manner prescribed by statute the obligation may be if the contract be not in that form be enforced against it in appropriate cases in equity The learned Judge then referred to the decision in the Indo Afghan Agencies case and observed that in that case it was laid down by this <ORG> that the <ORG> is not exempt from the equity arising out of the acts done by citizens to their prejudice relying upon the representations as to its future conduct made by the <ORG> A public body is in our judgment not exempt from liability to carry out its obligation arising out of representations made by it relying upon which a citizen has altered his position to his prejudice That rule has gained new dimensions in recent years A new class of estoppel i promissory estoppel has come to be recognised by the courts in this Country as well as in England The learned Judge after referring to the decisions in <ORG> case <NAME> Minister of Pensions supra and the Indo Afghan Agencies case pointed out that the rule laid down in these decisions undoubtedly advanced the cause of justice and hence we have no hesitation in accepting it because that was a decision strongly relied upon on behalf of the <ORG> for negativing the applicability of the doctrine of estoppel against the <ORG> This was a case where the appellant was appointed to a temporary post and on the post being abolished the service of the appellant was terminated The appellant challenged the validity of termination of service inter alia on the ground that the <ORG> was precluded from abolishing the post and terminating the service on the principle of promissory estoppel at paragraph and observed that the High <ORG> rightly held that the courts exclude the operation of the doctrine of estoppel when it is found that the authority against whom estoppel is pleaded has owed a duty to the public against whom the estoppel cannot fairly operate It was this observation which was heavily relied upon on behalf of the <ORG> but we fail to see how it can assist the contention of the <ORG> In the first place this observation was clearly obiter since as pointed out by us there was on the facts of the present case no scope for the applicability of the doctrine of promissory estoppel Secondly this observation was based upon a quotation from the passage in paragraph at page of Volume of American Jurisprudence but unfortunately this quotation was incomplete and it overlooked perhaps inadvertently the following two important sentences at the commencement of the paragraph which clearly show that even in the United <ORG>s the doctrine of promissory estoppel is applied against the <ORG> when justified by the facts There is considerable dispute as to the application of estoppel with respect to the <ORG> Even the truncated passage quoted by the <ORG> recognised in the last sentence that though as a general rule the doctrine of promissory estoppel would not be applied against the <ORG> in its governmental public or sovereign capacity the <ORG> would unhesitatingly allow the doctrine to be invoked in cases where it is necessary in order to prevent fraud or manifest injustice This proposition is unexceptionable because where the <ORG> owes a duty to the public to act in a particular manner and here obviously duty means a course of conduct enjoined by law the doctrine of promissory estoppel cannot be invoked for preventing the <ORG> from acting in discharge of its duty under the law The doctrine of promissory estoppel cannot be applied in teeth of an obligation or liability imposed by law It is not necessary to reproduce the facts of this case because the only purpose for which this decision was relied upon on behalf of the <ORG> was to show that the view taken by <ORG> in <NAME> <ORG> Supra was preferred by this Court to that taken by Lord <NAME> in <NAME> Minister of Pension supra It is true that in this case the Court expressed the opinion that the view taken by <ORG> is the correct one and not the one taken by Lord <NAME> but we fail to see how that can possibly help the argument of the <ORG> The ratio of the decision was succinctly put by Lord <NAME> when he said neither a minister nor any subordinate officer of the <ORG> can by any conduct or representation bar the <ORG> from enforcing a statutory prohibition or entitle the subject to maintain that there has been no breach of it It may also be noted that promissory estoppel cannot be invoked to compel the <ORG> or even a private party to do an act prohibited by law The <ORG> can never be precluded from exercising its legislative function by resort to the doctrine of promissory estoppel This was also a decision on which strong reliance was placed on behalf of the <ORG> In the first place it is clear that in this case there was factually no foundation for invoking the doctrine of promissory estoppel When the <ORG> auctioned the licence for retail sale of country liquor and the respondents being the highest bidders were granted such licence there was in force a Notification dated th April issued under section of the Sales Tax Act exempting sale of country liquor from payment of sales tax No announcement was made at the time of the auction whether the exemption from sales tax under this Notification dated th April was or was not likely to be withdrawn However on the day following the commencement of the licence granted to the respondents the <ORG> of issued a Notification dated nd April superseding the earlier Notification dated th April and imposing sales tax on the turnover in respect of country spirit with immediate effect This notification dated nd April was challenged by the respondents by filing a writ petition and amongst the several grounds of challenge taken in the writ petition one was that since the <ORG> <ORG> did not announce at the time of the aforesaid auction that the Notification dated th April was likely to be withdrawn and the sales of country liquor were likely to be subjected to the levy of sales tax during the excise year and in reply to the query made by them at the time of the auction they were told by the authorities that there was no sales tax on the sale of country liquor the appellants herein were estopped from making the demand in respect of sales tax and recovering the same from them It was in the context of this ground of challenge that the Court came to make the observation relied upon on behalf of the <ORG> Now it is clear that even taking the case of the respondents at its highest there was no representation or promise made by the <ORG> that they would continue the exemp tion from sales tax granted under the Notification dated th April and would not withdraw it and the Notification dated nd April could not therefore be assailed as being in breach of any such representation or promise There was accordingly no factual basis for making good the plea of promissory estoppel and the observation made by the court in regard to the applicability of the doctrine of promissory estoppel against the <ORG> was clear obiter That perhaps was the reason why the <ORG> did not consider it necessary to refer to the earlier decisions in <ORG> case and <ORG> case and particularly the decision in the Indo Afghan Agencies case where the court in so many terms applied the doctrine of promissory estoppel against the <ORG> in the exercise of its executive power This observation was made on the basis of certain decisions which the <ORG> proceeded to discuss in the succeeding paragraphs of the judgment The <ORG> first relied on the statement of the law contained in paragraph at page Volume of the American Jurisprudence but it omitted to mention the two important sentences at the commencement of the paragraph and the words unless its application is necessary to prevent fraud or manifest injustice at the end which clearly show that even according to the American Jurisprudence the doctrine of promissory estoppel is not wholly inapplicable against the <ORG> in its governmental public or sovereign capacity but it can be invoked against the <ORG> when justified by the facts as for example where it is necessary to prevent fraud or injustice In fact as already pointed out above there are numerous cases in the United States where the doctrine of promissory estoppel has been applied against the <ORG> in the exercise of its governmental public or executive powers The <ORG> then relied upon the decision in <ORG> case but that decision was confined to a case where legislation was sought to be precluded by relying on the doctrine of promissory estoppel and it was held and in our opinion rightly that there can be no promissory estoppel against the legislature in the exercise of its legislative function but this passage itself makes it clear that the courts will bind the <ORG> by its promise where it is necessary to do so in order to prevent manifest injustice or fraud The last decision on which the <ORG> relied was <ORG> <NAME> supra but this decision also does not support the view contended for on behalf of the State We have already referred to this decision earlier and pointed out that the <ORG> in this case was held not liable on the policy of insurance because the regulations made by the <ORG> prohibited insurance of reseeded wheat It will thus be seen from the decisions relied upon in the judgment that the <ORG> could not possibly have intended to lay down an absolute proposition that there can be no promissory estoppel against the <ORG> in the exercise of its governmental public or executive powers It was held in this case in paragraph of the judgment that the respondent could not invoke the doctrine of promissory estoppel because he was unable to show that relying on the representation of the Govern ment he had altered his position by investing moneys and the allegations made by him in that behalf were much too vague and general and there was accordingly no factual foundation for establishing the plea of promissory estoppel Moreover it is clear from paragraph of the judgment that this Court did not intend to lay down any proposition of law different from that enunciated in the <ORG> case because it approved of the decision in the <ORG> case and distinguished it on the ground that in that case there was not enforcement of contractual right but the claim was founded upon equity arising from the Scheme while in the case before the Court a contractual right was sought to be enforced There is therefore nothing in this decision which should compel us to take a view different from the one we are otherwise inclined to accept this Court approved of the decisions in the Indo Afghan Agencies case and <ORG> case and pointed out that these were cases where it could be held that public bodies or the <ORG> are as much bound as private individuals are to carry out obligations incurred by them because parties seeking to bind the authorities have altered their position to their disadvantage or have acted to their detriment on the strength of the representations made by these authorities It would therefore be seen that there is no authoritative decision of <ORG> which has departed from the law laid down in the celebrated decisions in the Indo Afghan Agencies case and <ORG> case The law laid down in these decisions as elaborated and expounded by us continues to hold the field It is clear from the letter of the th respondent dated rd January that a categorical representation was made by the th respondent on behalf of the <ORG> that the proposed vanaspati factory of the appellant would be entitled to exemption from sales tax in respect of sales of vanaspati effected in Uttar Pradesh for a period of three years from the date of commencement of production This representation was made by way of clarification in view of the suggestion in the appellant letter dated nd January that the financial institutions were not prepared to regard the earlier letter of the th respondent dated nd December as a definite commitment on the part of the <ORG> to grant exemption from sales tax Now the letter dated rd January clearly shows that the th respondent made this representation in his capacity as the Chief Secretary of the <ORG> and it was therefore a representation on behalf of the government It was faintly contended before us on behalf of the <ORG> that this representation was not binding on the <ORG> but we cannot countenance this argument because in the first place the averment in the writ petition that the th respondent made this representation on behalf of the government was not denied by the <ORG> in the affidavit in reply filed on its behalf and secondly it is difficult to accept the contention that the th respondent who was at the material time the Chief Secretary to the government and also advisor to the Governor who was discharging the functions of the <ORG> We must therefore proceed on the basis that this representation made by the th respondent was a representation within the scope of his authority and was binding on the <ORG> The <ORG> however contended that the doctrine of promissory estoppel had no application in the present case because the appellant did not suffer any detriment by acting on the representation made by the <ORG> the vanaspati factory set up by the appellant was quite a profitable concern and there was no prejudice caused to the appellant We do not think it is necessary in order to attract the applicability of the doctrine of promissory estoppel that the promisee acting in reliance of the promise should suffer any detriment This position was implied accepted by <NAME> in the High Trees case when the learned Judge pointed out that the promise must be one which was intended to create legal relations and which to the knowledge of the person making the promise was going to be acted on by the person to whom it was made and which was in fact acted an emphasis supplied Viscount <NAME> also observed in <ORG> <ORG> that the gist of the equity lies in the fact that one party has by his conduct led the other to alter his position Then again in <NAME> <NAME> supra Lord <NAME> said This equity is however subject to the qualification that the other party has altered his position There is in fact not a single case in England where detriment is insisted upon as a necessary ingredient of promissory estoppel We do not think that in order to invoke the doctrine of promissory estoppel it is necessary for the promise to show that he suffered detriment as a result of acting in reliance on the promise But we may make it clear that if by detriment we mean injustice to the promisee which could result if the promisor were to recede from his promise then detriment would certainly come in as a necessary ingredient The detriment in such a case is not some prejudice suffered by the promisee by acting on the promise but the prejudice which would be caused to the promisee if the promisor were allowed to go back on the promise The classic exposition of detriment in this sense is to be found in the following passage from the judgment of <NAME> in the Australian case of <NAME> <ORG> It is often said simply that the party asserting the estoppel must have been induced to act to his detriment Although substantially such a statement is correct and leads to no misunderstanding it does not bring out clearly the basal purpose of the doctrine That purpose is to avoid or prevent a detriment to the party asserting the estoppel by compelling the opposite party to adhere to the assumption upon which the former acted or abstained from acting This means that the real detriment or harm from which the law seeks to give protection is that which would flow from the change of position if the assumption were deserted that led to it So long as the assumption is adhered to the party who altered his situation upon the faith of it cannot complain His complaint is that when afterwards the other party makes a different state of affairs the basis of an assertion of right against him then if it is allowed his own original change of position will operate as a detriment His action or inaction must be such that if the assumption upon which he proceeded were shown to be wrong and an inconsistent state of affairs were accepted as the foundation of the rights and duties of himself and the opposite party the consequence would be to make his original act or failure to act or source of prejudice It would therefore be correct to say that in order to invoke the doctrine of promissory estoppel it is enough to show that the promisee has acting in reliance of the promise altered his position and it is not necessary for him to further show that he has acted to his detriment Here the appellant clearly altered its position by borrowing moneys from various financial institutions purchasing plant and machinery from <ORG> Bombay and setting up a vanaspati plant in the belief induced by the representation of the <ORG> that sales tax exemption would be granted for a period of three years from the date of commencement of the production Of course it may be pointed out that if the Sales Tax Act did not contain a provision enabling the <ORG> to grant exemption it would not be possible to enforce the representation against the <ORG> because the <ORG> cannot be compelled to act contrary to the statute but since section of the Sales Tax Act confers power on the <ORG> to grant exemption from sales tax the <ORG> can legitimately be held bound by its promise to exempt the appellant from payment of sales tax It is true that taxation is a sovereign or governmental function but for reasons which we have already discussed no distinction can be made between the exercise of a sovereign or governmental function and a trading or business activity of the <ORG> so far as the doctrine of promissory estoppel is concerned We are therefore of the view that in the present case the <ORG> was bound to exempt the appellant from payment of sales tax in respect of sales of vanaspati effected by it in the State of Uttar Pradesh for a period of three years from the date of commencement of the production and was not entitled to recover such sales tax from the appellant But when the assessment was made by <ORG> sales tax was levied on the appellant at the rate of and the appellant was required to pay up a further sum of Rs The appellant had prayed for an interim order in the present appeal staying further proceedings but this Court by an order dated rd April granted interim stay only on the appellant paying up the amount of sales tax due for the assessment year before st July and so far as the assessment years and were concerned the Court directed that the assessments for those years may proceed but only the final order shall not be passed It appears that surcharge amounting to Rs Now obviously since the Government is bound to exempt the appellant from payment of sales tax for a period of three years from nd July being the date of commencement of the production the appellant would not be liable to pay any sales tax to the <ORG> in respect of sales of vanaspati effected during that period and hence the <ORG> would have to refund to the appellant the amount of sales tax paid for the period nd July to st March subject to any claim which the <ORG> may have to retain any part of such amount under any provision of law If no such claim is made or if made not adjudicated upon within the time specified the <ORG> will refund the amount of sales tax to the appellant with interest thereon at the rate of per annum from the date when such refund becomes due and if such claim is made and adjudicated upon within the specified time and it is found that a part of this amount is liable to be retained by the <ORG> under some provision of law the <ORG> will refund the balance to the appellant with interest at the like rate So far as the assessment years and are concerned <ORG> will proceed to complete the Assessments for those assessment years in the light of the law laid down in this judgment and the amounts of sales tax deposited by the appellant will be refunded to the appellant to the extent to which they are not found due and payable as a result of the assessments subject to any claim which the <ORG> may have to retain those amounts under any provision of law We accordingly allow the appeal set aside the judgment of <ORG> and issue a writ order or direction to the above effect against the respondents The State will pay the costs of the appellant throughout
