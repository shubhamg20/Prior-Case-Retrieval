This petition under Article of the Constitution of India presents yet another dimension of the doctrine of estoppel which as the judicial decisions demonstrate has many facets The facts are set out in paragraphs to below Thereafter it was extended from time to time <ORG> constitutes a committee known as <ORG> <ORG> for short consisting of the Secretaries to <ORG> in <ORG> and <ORG> and other officers The <ORG> has the over all authority over the disbursing agencies like the respondent No who disburse the amount of subsidy sanctioned by the <ORG> After disbursing the amount of subsidy the agency prefers a claim with the <ORG> for reimbursement of the amount disbursed The petitioner applied for grant of central subsidy under the scheme The only point urged by learned counsel for the petitioner is that the respondents and and their agency the <ORG> on whose promise the petitioner acted are estopped from withholding or denying to the petitioner of the amount of subsidy The arguments proceeded on the assumption that the petitioner acting on the aforesaid letter altered his position Such corporation can be compelled to perform their obligations arising from a promise made by them The reason is that the authority had statutory duty to collect the full amount and had no power to release the customer expressly or otherwise Where Government changes its policy resulting in refusal to fulfil the promise no estoppel arises ii As a corollary it follows that the sanction of the subsidy the promise was made by a body which had no authority to make it In view of the two facts set out in paragraph above the promise by the <ORG> becomes without authority and estoppel cannot be invoked to legitimate action which is ultra vires Realising that the <ORG> had no legal existence after st October making its promise unauthorised learned counsel for the petitioner called in aid the judgment in <NAME> Minister of Pensions KB The Director of <ORG> of <ORG> on th April wrote to <NAME> that your case has been duly considered and your disability has been accepted as attributable to military service He thus altered his position acting on the letter from the Director of <ORG> iii The citizen is not expected to know the limits of the authority to make the promise Its letter binds the <ORG> through whom it also binds <NAME> There are clear features which distinguish <NAME> case with the case which I am called upon to decide In the present case there is no such relationship between the petitioner and the <ORG> Secondly the <ORG> was held bound by the promise by the Director of Personnel Services irrespective of whether the latter acted within his authority the one hand and the <ORG> on the other and read in the letter an authority in the war office to make the promise A fourth distinguishing feature is that whether the Ministry of Pension had authorised it or not the <ORG> was held bound by what the war office promised The war office has continued authority to deal with cases of the members of the armed forces The basic postulate of <NAME> was that where <ORG> wrongfully assumes authority to perform some legal act the citizen is entitled to assume that it has that authority Adminsitrative Law <NAME> Fifth Edition Page I know of no such principle in our law nor was any authority for it cited The illegality of an act is the same whether or not the actor has been misled by an assumption of authority on the part of the Government officer however high or low in the hierarchy <NAME> <ORG> AC If the promise by an official who has no legal power is given the force of law ultra vires acts will gain legitimacy which is a negation of the fundamental canons of administrative law Administrative Law <NAME> Fifth Edition Page The burden of ascertaining whether the officer has such authority is on the purchaser A For Ceylon <NAME> AC at page <ORG> All ER the planning officer without having the authority stated that <ORG> had the existing user right in respect of the site in question and that the District council who had the statutory authority would grant planning permission It was held that since there was nothing apart from the position held by the Planning Officer on which the <ORG> could have assumed that the officer could bind the council the council was not estopped by anything the planning officer had said from refusing the applications by <ORG> In A for Ceylon A For Ceylon <NAME> AC at page the sale of <ORG> property by an officer having no authority was held not binding on the <ORG> <NAME> assumed that the citizen is not expected to know the limits of the authority to make promises Considerations of hardship to the citizen led him to this conclusion Again the proposition that a citizen is not expected to know the limits of the authority of an officer to make the promise tends to legitimise unauthorised promises To hold that a citizen acting on an unauthorised promise without enquiring into the limits of such authority can bind a public authority is to create a power which does not exist at a time when the scheme which created the <ORG> was not in force
