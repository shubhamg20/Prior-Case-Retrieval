HEADNOTE The appellant prayed for the issue of a writ of mandamus and a writ of prohibition against the respondent <ORG> in a writ application filed in <ORG> on the ground that his liability as surety for some contractors stood discharged on account of a particular action of the <ORG> He thereupon filed a suit against the respondent and raised the same plea that he was discharged from liability as surety on the same grounds The trial court the first appellate Court and <ORG> Held that the suit was barred by res judicata in view of the judgment of <ORG> on the writ petition The provisions of Civil Procedure Code are not exhaustive with respect to an earlier decision operating as res judicata between the same parties on the same matter in controversy in a subsequent regular suit and on the general principle of res judicata any previous decision on a matter in controversy decided after full contest or after affording fair opportunity to the parties to prove their case by a court competent to decide it will operate as res judicata in a subsequent regular suit It is not necessary that the court deciding the matter formerly be competent to decide the subsequent suit or that the former proceeding and the subsequent suit have the same subject matter There is therefore no good reason to preclude such decisions on matters in controversy in writ proceedings under Arts <NAME> This appeal by special leave raises the question whether a decision of <ORG> on merits on a certain matter after contest in a writ petition under Art The facts leading to the appeal are these The contracts were taken as a result of auctions which took place under the Conditions of Auction Sale of Forests in the Baria <ORG> in the Samvat year corresponding to A though in the plaint these conditions were referred to as Forest Auction Rules It was further mentioned in the application that if those contractors would arrive at an arrangement with him and carry out the vahivat be would do the needful in that behalf On this application it appears <ORG> issued notices to the contractors stating therein that the surety i the appellant had moved under cl of the Conditions of the Auction Sale of jungle goods for attachment of their goods that be lying in the godowns at Baria Piplod and Limkheda in the <ORG> and the debts or other movable or immovable property belonging to them and for delivering the same to him and directed the contractors not to sell mortgage gift away or otherwise dispose of whatever movable or immovable property they had in the <ORG> without the permission of the <ORG> It however appears from the order of <ORG> on that writ petition that the reliefs claimed were a direction to the respondents i the State of Bombay and the <NAME> of Baria Taluka to raise the attachment levied on Municipal Nos and of Deogad Baria the issue of a writ of mandamus or directions under Art The appellant had alleged in that petition that the attached properties of the contractors were allowed to be sold by the contractors without the knowledge and consent of the appellant that the sale was unauthorised and contrary to the terms of the attachment levied by the <ORG> and that therefore it bad put an end to the liability of the appellants under their surety bonds It was urged for the appellant at the hearing of that petition that since the State allowed the contractors to sell their own properties the appellant had been discharged from his suretyship in respect of the said contractors and that the State could no longer claim to recover from him the balance due from the said contractors The writ application was presented because in default of the contracts to pay the balance amount due from them the Forest Officers of <ORG> had moved the Revenue Officers to recover the said amount from the appellant who was the surety as an arrear of land revenue The revenue authorities took steps to attach the immovable properties of the appellant and that led the appellant to present that petition The petition was misconceived as not maintainable and there was no case for the issue of a writ of mandamus because the proper course for the appellant was to redress his so called grievance by proceeding according to the ordinary law through <ORG> There were no Baria State Forest Auction Rules The contractors had to furnish a surety who also had to execute a separate and independent agreement with the <ORG> in the Form approved by it The said agreements stipulated three important conditions i that the surety will pay the installment amount as stipulated ii that if the instalments were not paid on due dates he will pay interest at one pie per rupee per day and iii that if he fails to pay the instalment amounts and the interest the <ORG> will be at liberty to recover the same from any of his properties and from his successors and assignees In that case the property effects and debts of the contractor that may be within the territory of the <ORG> shall as in the case of land revenue be attached and auctioned at the cost and risk of the contractor and out of the sale proceeds realised at the auction the amount due to the surety or an amount equivalent to the amount required to discharge his liability shall be paid to the <ORG> According to the record the appellant had requested the <ORG> to release the goods of certain contractors by his letters dated May and of <ORG> dismissed the writ petition on July holding that there was no substance in the contention that the petitioners had been discharged from their liability as sureties The prayer made by the appellant in his application dated April did not include a prayer to the effect that the attached goods be not sold without his knowledge and consent We are no more concerned with the other point raised by the writ petition to the effect that the revenue authorities were not entitled to recover the amount due from the appellant under the summary procedure prescribed by the Land Revenue Code On August the appellant instituted the suit which has given rise to this appeal on or about April applied to the Baria State praying for the assets and properties of the contractors to be taken in attachment and sold and for facilities being made available to him to fulfill his liabilities under the surety bonds It was further alleged in the plaint that subsequent to the merger of the Baria State with the Bombay State on October <ORG> without asking the plaintiff or without his consent allowed the said contractors to remove and sell their respective teak and sundry goods which were taken in attachment and thus behaving in contravention of the attachment made in his interest and put an end to his security and that according to law the plaintiff thus became discharged of liability as surety for the said contractors It was also mentioned in the plaint that the appellant had to make a petition to <ORG> in order to prevent his property from being sold and that he had been informed that the said petition had been dismissed on the ground that he could lawfully get his reliefs in <ORG> It may be declared that have become is charged from all liability as surety for the contractors mentioned in para of this plaint and a decree may be passed against the defendant No and defendant No herein and their servants officers and agents in the form of a permanent injunction prohibiting them for all times from attaching my property selling or causing it to be sold A permanent injunction may be issued to the defendant No herein and their servants agents and officers that these defendants under the facts mentioned in this plaint shall not unless in execution of a decree in their favour obtained from a proper and authorised court attach any property of this plaintiff and sell it in the revenue manner or cause it to be sold Issue No A was Is the suit barred by res judicata in view of <ORG> judgment in Civil Applications No and of <ORG> held on this issue that judgment operated as res judicata in the suit It recorded its findings on the other issues as well but we are not concerned with those findings It dismissed the suit On appeal by the appellant the District Judge agreed with <ORG> that the suit was barred by res judicata in view of the judgment of <ORG> on the writ petition He accordingly dismissed the appeal He also recorded his findings on the other points urged before him He further considered the question whether in the circumstances of the case the appellant was entitled to the injunction prayed for and held that it was open to the appellant to maintain the suit for the determination of the amount due from him as that had not been considered and determined in the writ petition He therefore allowed the appeal set aside the order of the District Judge and passed a decree in favour of the appellant declaring that he was liable to pay the amount due under the surety agreement less the amount paid by the contractor and such amount as had been recovered by the <ORG> by sale of the property of the contractor attached under condition No He further ordered issue of an injunction restraining the <ORG> from enforcing the liability for the amount in excess of the amount declared to be due from the appellant The appellant application for leave to file an appeal under cl of the Letters Patent of <ORG> was rejected Thereafter the appellant filed this appeal after obtaining special leave from this Court Mr <NAME> for the appellant has urged two points for the issue of a writ of mandamus does not operate as res judicata in a regular suit subsequently filed for a declaration of the plaintiff rights and for the issue of an order of injunction against the defendant It has been said that it would be very dangerous to hold that the decision in the writ application operates as res judicata in the regular suit even if identical reliefs on identical grounds were prayed for in a writ petition with those prayed for in the later regular suit It is clear from what has been stated above that the appellant prayed for the issue of a writ of mandamus and a writ of prohibition in the writ application on the ground that his liability as surety for the several contractors stood discharged on account of the <ORG> without the knowledge and consent of the appellant allowing the contractors to dispose of the goods which had been attached on the application of the appellant an application which he could present in view of Condition of the Conditions of Auction Sale In both cases on both occasions the <ORG> had first to hold that his liability as a surety stood discharged and that as a consequence of such a finding it had in the writ proceedings to issue a writ of mandamus and a writ of prohibition as prayed for in the writ peti tion directing the <ORG> of Bombay not to enforce any liability which the appellant had undertaken under the agreements executed as a surety and not to proceed with the realisation of any amount the <ORG> alleged to be due from him and in the suit to pass a decree prohibiting the defendants by a permanent injunction for all time from attaching his property selling or causing it to be sold and also a permanent injunction to the <ORG> of Bombay restraining them from attaching and selling any proper of the appellant unless a proper decree is obtained from the <ORG> in the manner provided for the recovery of land revenue It is urged for the appellant that in the writ petition the contention about the appellant liability as a surety having come to an end was based on the terms of the contract which was based on the conditions of auction sales between the appellant and the State of Baria while in the present suit the contention with respect to the cession of his liability as a surety was based on the auction rules It is denied in the reply affidavit filed on behalf of the respondent in the writ petition that there were any Baria State Forest Auction Rules We have not been referred to any rules In fact when we asked for the rules we were provided by learned counsel for the appellant with a booklet by the name Conditions for the Auction Sale of Forests Further the order of <ORG> on the writ petition mentions in the early part of the order It would appear that the Baria State had auctioned the teak wood trees on the terms and conditions contained in the said Forest Auction Rules It cannot therefore be disputed that if the decision which had been given in a writ petition had been given in a regular suit that decision would have operated as res judicata in the later suit The question which arises for consideration is whether such a decision in a writ petition can also bar a later suit on account of its operating as res judicata Before we deal with the question we may dispose of the short points urged for the appellant It is urged that if a decision in a writ application on merits be held to operate as res judicata in a regular suit the provisions of would also be applicable to the institution of the subsequent suit with respect to such part of the cause of action for which no relief was sought in the writ petition The contention is not sound as the provisions of apply only to suits Sub rule then provides that where a plaintiff omits to sue in respect of or intentionally relinquishes any portion of his claim he shall not afterwards sue in respect of the portion so omitted or relinquished of the Constitution but the High <ORG> having disallowed the claim of the appellant for salary prior to the date of the suit we do not think that we would be justified in Supp The contention that a decision on a writ petition even on merits should not operate as res judicata as it is discretionary for the Court to pass any order it considers fit on a writ petition and not to decide it after considering all the points urged by the parties was negatived in <NAME> The State of With regard to the point that the issue of a writ by <ORG> was discretionary as it may refuse to exercise its jurisdiction under Art as for instance when the party applying for the writ was guilty of laches but <ORG> could not refuse to issue the appropriate writ once it was shown that a fundamental right had been infringed it was said at and that may be said to constitute a difference in the right conferred on a citizen to move <ORG> under Art as distinct from the right conferred on him to move this Court This difference must inevitably mean that if <ORG> has refused to exercise its discretion on the ground of laches or on the ground that the party has an efficacious alternative remedy available to him then of course the decision of <ORG> cannot generally be pleaded in support of the bar of res judicata If however the matter has been considered on the merits and <ORG> has dismissed the petition for a writ on the ground that no fundamental right is proved or its breach is either not established or is shown to be constitutionally justified there is no reason why the said decision should not be treated as a bar against the competence of a subsequent petition filed by the same party on the same facts and for the same reliefs under Art In this connection reference may be made to what was said about the contention that a previous judgment was not to operate as res judicata against a party as it was based on certain statements recorded before that party was impleaded in <NAME> <NAME> It was suggested by Mr <NAME> that the former judgment ought not to be binding because certain witnesses having been examined before the present Appellant intervened in the suit he was refused the opportunity of cross examining them Another reason urged in support of the contention is that the petitioner in a writ petition had no right to apply for the issue of the appropriate writ and it is a matter of discretion for <ORG> to entertain any application or to grant it and that a decision in one proceeding can operate as res judicata in a subsequent proceeding only when the party initiating the first proceeding had a right to initiate both the proceedings when the nature of both the proceedings be the same It is further submitted for the appellant that a writ of mandamus according to its nature is to be issued mainly to compel the performance by a public servant of his duty of a public nature while in a suit the plaintiff prays for the enforcement of his personal rights It has also been contended and support is sought from the case reported as Janakirama lyer <NAME> that the general principles of res judicata are not to be applied in considering whether a decision in a previous suit bars a later suit on the ground of res judicata On the other hand it is contended for the respondent that the doctrine of res judicata is not confined to the provisions of II but is of a general application on grounds of public policy that the fact that the proceedings on a writ petition are conducted summarily is no reason to reduce the value of the decision arrived at in those proceedings especially when a solemn decision is given after affording an opportunity to the parties to put before the Supp It is pertinently pointed out that if the writ application presented by the appellant had been allowed by <ORG> on a finding of fact that the liability of the appel lant as a surety stood discharged and a writ of prohibition had been issued against the <ORG> as prayed for by the appellant in the writ proceedings the <ORG> could not have sued for a declaration that these orders of <ORG> were bad and that a decree be passed in its favour declaring that the appellant liability as the surety still continued and that the <ORG> was free to take any action open to it under law for the recovery of the amount due from him It is not necessary to consider in any detail whether all orders made on a writ petition would bar a subsequent suit those which had been earlier and after full contest decided on merits by a competent <ORG> in any other proceeding including proceedings on a writ petition Before discussing the law of res judicata as laid down in the Code of Civil Procedure we may refer to the opinion of the Judges expressed in in the Duches of Kingston Case to which reference has been invariably made in most of the cases to be considered by us It was said in that case From the variety of cases relative to judgments being given in evidence in civil suits these two deductions seem to follow as generally true first that judgment of a <ORG> of concurrent jurisdiction directly upon the point is as a plea a bar or as evidence conclusive between the same parties upon the same matter directly in question in another <ORG> secondly that the judgment of a <ORG> of exclusive jurisdiction directly upon the point is in like manner conclusive upon the same matter between the same parties coming incidentally in question in another <ORG> for a different purpose evidence of any matter which came collaterally in question though within their jurisdiction nor of any matter incidentally cognizable nor of any matter to be inferred by argument from the judgment It is obvious that the judgment of a <ORG> of exclusive jurisdiction is to be treated as res judicata upon the same matter in another <ORG> which will not be a <ORG> having jurisdiction over the matter Its section gave jurisdiction to the civil courts over all suits of a civil nature with the exception of those of which cognizance was barred by any Act of Parliament or by any Regulation of the Codes of Bengal Madras and Bombay or by any Act of the Governor General of India in Council Since then Civil Courts had jurisdiction to try all suits of a civil nature except those whose cognizance was barred by any enactment in force Section provided that <ORG> would not take cognizance of any suit brought on a cause of action which had been heard and determined by a Court of competent jurisdiction in a former suit between the same parties or between parties under whom they claimed The bar to the second suit was based on the identity of it cause of action with that of the earlier suit which had been heard and determined by a court of competent jurisdiction between the same parties This principle had the approval of <ORG> in <NAME> Hamilton In Khugawlee Sing Hossein Bux Khan <ORG> after quoting the opinion in Duchess of Kingston Case said There is nothing technical or peculiar to the law of England in the rule as so stated That section reads No <ORG> shall try any suit or issue in which the matter directly and substantially in issue has been heard and finally decided by a <ORG> of competent jurisdiction in a former suit between the same parties or between parties under whom they or any of them claim litigating under the same title It referred to of Act VIII of and then observed at It is clear that this section would not have applied to the present case the causes of action in the two suits the non payment of interest in one and the non payment of principal in the other being different The expression Court of competent jurisdiction was construed to mean a Court which had jurisdiction over the matter in the subsequent suit in which the decision was used as conclusive or in other words a Court of concurrent jurisdiction It appears to their Lordships that if this case had arisen before the passing of Act of <ORG> in India would have rightly held that the decision of the Extra Assistant Commissioner in the first suit was not conclusive as to the amount of the principal sum due on the bond And as the words of the section do not clearly shew an intention to alter the law their Lordships do not think it right to put a construction upon them which would cause an alteration <NAME> Section II of the present Code of Civil Procedure Act of deals with res judicata and is in these terms No <ORG> shall try any suit or issue in which the matter directly and substantially in issue has been directly and substantially in issue in a former suit between the same parties or between parties under whom they or any of them claim litigating under the same title in a <ORG> competent to try such subsequent suit or the suit in which such issue has been subse quently raised and has been heard and finally decided by such <ORG> Section by its terms can be applicable only to a subsequent suit when the same matter in controversy had been heard and decided in an earlier suit by a <ORG> competent to try the subsequent suit There is nothing however in its language to exclude the application of the general principles of res judicata to suits It is urged that there seems to be no good principle behind applying the general principles of res judicata to suits in circumstances which do not bring the previous decision within the language of and that the legislature restricting the application of the general principles of res judicata to the circumstances mentioned in must be deemed to indicate that the general principle of res judicata be not applied to bar a subsequent suit if the earlier decision of the same controversy between the same parties had been arrived at in proceedings other than suits and in which the entire procedure provided for the decision of the dispute in a regular suit might not have been followed The legislature was providing in the Code of Civil Procedure for the trial of suits over which <ORG> was given jurisdiction under the provisions of the Code The preamble of the Code of reads Whereas it is expedient to consolidate and amend the laws relating to the procedure of <ORG> It is hereby enacted as follows The Code was dealing with procedure of the civil <ORG>s only and had therefore not to consider what would be the effect on the trial of suits in view of the provisions of other enactments or of general principles of res judicata or of any other kind It had to restrict its provision about res judicata to the effect of decisions in a civil suit on a subsequent civil suit and therefore enacted in the form in which we find it It made one of the condition for the application of a previous decision to operate as res judicata to be that the previous decision is made not only by a <ORG> competent to make it but by a <ORG> which be competent to try the subsequent suit Whatever the reason may be the provisions of will govern a previous decision in a suit barring a subsequent suit with respect to the same matter in controversy and general principles of res judicata in such particular circumstances will neither be available to bar a subsequent suit nor will be needed We may now refer to some of the decided cases having a bearing on the applicability of the general principles of res judicata to suits when the previous decision is not in a suit but in other proceedings It was said at The question as to the perpetuity had been definitely and properly before him on the former hearing and was in fact decided without any reservation as is made plain by the terms of the judgment itself which show that the determination of the dispute as to the perpetuity was the foundation of the whole judgment It is not and indeed it cannot be disputed that if that be the case the matter has been finally settled between the parties for the mere fact that the decision was given in an administration suit does not affect its finality see <NAME> <NAME> Ch <ORG> however took a different view and regarding the question as still open decided it against the appellant but the error in their judgment is due to the fact that they regarded the question as completely governed by of the Code of Civil Procedure It was said at When once the award as to the amount has become final all questions as to fixing of compensation are then at an end the duty of the Collector in case of dispute as to the relative rights of the persons together entitled to the money is to place the money under the control of the <ORG> and the parties then can proceed to litigate in the ordinary way to determine what their right and title to the property may be That is exactly what occurred in the present case How the proceedings were commenced is a matter that is not material provided that they were instituted in the manner that gave the <ORG> jurisdiction for they ended in a decree made by the High <ORG> and appealable to this Board In <NAME> <NAME> it was said But in view of the arguments addressed to them their Lordships desire to emphasize that the rule of res judicata while founded on ancient precedent is dictated by a wisdom which is for all time It hath been well said declared Lord <NAME> interest reipublicae ut sit finis litium otherwise great oppression might be done under colour and pretence of law <NAME> a Though the rule of the Code may be traced to an English source it embodies a doctrine in no way opposed to the spirit of the law as expounded by the Hindu commentators <NAME> and Nilakantha include the plea of a former judgment among those allowed by law each citing for this purpose the text of <NAME> who describes the plea thus If a person though defeated at law sue again he should be answered You were defeated formerly This is called the plea of former judgment And so the application of the rule by the <ORG> in India should be influenced by no technical considerations of form but by matter of substance within the limits allowed by law This Court had to consider the question of the applicability of the general principles of res judicata in several cases and has repeatedly held that this principle is not based on a rule of technicality but is based on high public policy to bring about an end to litigation by giving finality to judgments inter parties and to save a litigant from harassment a second time and in these circumstances it has to be held that the question of title to the four anna share was necessarily and substantially involved in the land acquisition proceedings and was finally decided by a court having jurisdiction to try it and that decision thus operates as res judicata In that case the rule of res judicata was applied to litigation in land acquisition proceedings In that case the general principles of law bearing on the rule of res judicata and not the provisions of of the Code of Civil Procedure were applied to the case The rule of res judicata is meant to give finality to a decision arrived at after due contest and after hearing the parties interested in the controversy This case made the decision in a former petition under Art In <NAME> Case this <ORG> had again dealt with the question of the applicability of the principle of res judicata in writ proceedings in <ORG> is dismissed not on the merits but because of the laches of the party applying for the writ or because it is held that the party had an alternative remedy available to it the dismissal of the writ petition would not constitute a bar to a subsequent petition under art If a writ petition is dismissed in limine and an order is pronounced in that behalf whether or not the dismissal would constitute a bar would depend on the nature of the order If the petition is dismissed in limine without a speaking order such dismissal cannot be treated as creating a bar of res judicata The basis for the rule is described thus at But is the rule of res judicata merely a technical rule or is it based on high public policy If the rule of res judicata itself embodies a principle of public policy which in turn is an essential part of the rule of law then the objection that the rule cannot be invoked where fundamental rights are in question may lose much of its validity It is in the interest of the public at large that a finality should attach to the binding decisions pronounced by Courts of competent jurisdiction and it is also in the public interest that individuals should not be vexed twice over with the same kind of litigation Again it was said at The binding character of judgments pronounced by courts of competent jurisdiction is itself an essential part of the rule of law and the rule of law obviously is the basis of the administration of justice on which the Constitution lays so much emphasis Limitations to the applicability of this general rule of res judicata are indicated at It is true that the general rule can be invoked only in cases where a dispute between the parties has been referred to a court of competent jurisdiction there has been a contest between the parties before the court a fair opportunity has been given to both of them to prove their case and at the end the court has pronounced its judgment or decision Such a decision pronounced by a court of competent jurisdiction is binding between the parties unless it is modified or reversed by adopting a procedure prescribed by the Constitution It can be said with equal force that a regular suit for the determination of the matter which had been decided on merits by <ORG> or this <ORG> on a writ petition cannot be given the status of a de facto appeal against the order of <ORG> or of this <ORG> are alternate remedies and so the adoption of one remedy cannot bar the adoption of the other which was urged in the aforesaid case was negatived and it was observed at In such a case the point to consider always would be what is the nature of the decision pronounced by a of res judicata altogether in dealing with writ petitions filed by citizens alleging the contravention of their fundamental rights Considerations of public policy cannot be ignored in such cases and the basic doctrine that judgments pronounced by this <ORG> are binding and must be regarded as final between the parties in respect of matters covered by them must receive due consideration The decision was based on two grounds that the jurisdiction of <ORG> under art A decision of the <ORG> in a writ petition can be res judicata only with respect to the matters which have been decided on merits by <ORG> or by this <ORG> <ORG>s do not usually enter into disputed questions of fact but there is no bar to their doing so if they feel disposed to enter into such facts and arrive at a conclusion with respect to them We do not see why all the grounds which can be urged in support of or against a matter raised for decision in a writ petition cannot be urged in the proceedings on it As a result of the above discussion we are of opinion that the provisions of are not exhaustive with respect to an earlier decision operating as res judicata between the same parties on the same matter in controversy in a subsequent regular suit and that on the general principle of res judicata any previous decision on a matter in controversy decided after full contest or after affording fair opportunity to the parties to prove their case by a <ORG> competent to decide it will operate as res judicata in a subsequent regular suit We do not see any good reason to preclude such decisions on matters in controversy in writ proceedings under arts We may make it clear that it was not necessary and we have not considered whether the principles of constructive res judicata can be invoked by a party to the subsequent suit on the ground that a matter which might or ought to have been raised in the earlier proceeding was not so raised therein We therefore dismiss this appeal with costs <NAME> I have persued the judgment prepared by my learned brother <NAME> I regret my inability to agree I shall briefly give my reasons I need not restate them raised are these The appellant filed a petition in <ORG> under Art In the suit from which the present appeal arises he again raises the plea that he was discharged as surety in other words he seeks to reopen in the present suit the finding given by <ORG> in the writ petition It says inter alia that no <ORG> shall try any suit or issue in which the matter directly and substantially in issue has been directly and substantially in issue in a former suit To invoke this doctrine the section lays down many conditions It follows and indeed it is not disputed that of the Code does not bar the appellant from raising the question of the discharge of his suretyship again in the present suit When the Code of Civil Procedure enacted prescribing precisely when an earlier decision would be res judicata in a suit it is not open to invoke the general principles of res judicata in the context of a subsequent suit though the conditions laid down in the section were not satisfied for otherwise the section would become nugatory it would also introduce anomalies The cases cited at the <ORG> do not compel me to accept the construction which would lead to that result The order of <ORG> is set aside and the appeal is remanded to <ORG> for disposal on merits in accordance with law Costs will abide the result ORDER In accordance with the Opinion of the Majority the Appeal is dismissed with costs
