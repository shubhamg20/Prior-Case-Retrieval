Messrs <ORG> hereinafter referred to as the Mills are engaged in the manufacture of Maida which is item no of the First Schedule attached to the Central Excises and Salt Act hereinafter referred to as the Excise Act and bolts nuts and screws which are item no of the said Schedule as also certain articles which are included under item no of the Schedule Thereafter by a notification dated th June under Rule of the Rules copy of which is annexure <ORG> exempted goods falling under item of the First Schedule if to be utilised for home consumption and if the total value of all excisable goods in the preceding financial year docs not exceed Rupees thirty lakhs The Assistant Collector of Central Excise respondent no however asserts that the value of Maida cleared in the previous financial year shall be taken into account for determining the exemption under the aforesaid notification The Excise Act under Section defines excisable goods and Section is the charging section which provides that there shall be levied and collected in such manner as may be prescribed duties of excise on all excisable goods other than salt which are produced or manufactured at the rates set forth in the First Schedule and it further empowers different tariff values to be fixed for different classes or descriptions of the same article Section authorises <ORG> by notification from such date as may be specified in it to have the production or manufacture or any process of production or manufacture of any specified goods included in the First Schedule licence the production or of salt petre or any specified component parts or ingredients of such goods or of specified containers of such goods in accordance with the terms and conditions granted under this Act It appears that to begin with the First Schedule contained items which has now increased to items Section empowers <ORG> to make rules and under Section such rules have to be laid before <ORG> while it is in session for a total period of days which may be comprised in one or two more successive sessions The <ORG> have the power to modify or annul the Rules Under Rule <ORG> is authorised from time to time by notification in the official gazette to exempt subject to such conditions as may be specified in the notification any excisable goods from the whole or any part of the duty leviable on such goods The aforesaid two notifications annexures and have been issued under this provision On the th or th of December the Superintendent of <ORG> Patna City respondent no issued a letter to the petitioners that since the annual turnover of the mills including the sale of Maida which is item in the Schedule was more than Rs A counter affidavit has been filed on behalf of the respondents stating that the exemption granted by annexure would not exempt the liability of the mills from paying the duty upon goods under the head item no manufactured by them inasmuch as the value of <ORG> produced in the previous financial year had to be taken into account Reference was made to Sections and A as also of the Act which provide for appeals and revisions to <ORG> as also to <ORG> itself This preliminary objection was resisted by <NAME> who submitted that where a fundamental right is involved consideration of alternative remedy is irrelevant and he referred to a number of decisions in support of this submission Whether such an application should not be entertained as there is an alternative remedy should be considered at the time of admission of the writ application and once the writ application is admitted and heard on merits it should not be rejected merely on that ground Therefore it would not be permissible now to reject this application on the ground that the petitioners have availed of the alternative remedies provided under the Excise Act itself It may further be pointed out that in paragraph of the writ petition it has been asserted that the petitioners have learnt that a communication bearing No No TRU dated th July the Under Secretary to <ORG> in the Ministry of Finance <ORG> has advised all the Collectors of Central Excise in India that in computing the sum of Rupees thirty lakhs as per the proviso to the notification copy of which is annexure the value of all excisable goods whether exempted or not exempted should be taken into account and in that view of the advice the remedy before any of the superior officers of the <ORG> would be futile In the counter affidavit filed by the respondents in paragraph it is stated that the aforesaid statement is not admitted and that the decision of respondent no is based upon a correct interpretation of the notification In support of this application on merits Mr <NAME> has made two submissions namely that Maida having been exempted from excise duty was not excisable goods the value of which could be taken into account for the annual turnover For the sake of convenience I will first consider the second submission made on behalf of the petitioners Before doing so it would be relevant to quote the notification which reads thus In exercise of the powers conferred by Sub rule of Rule of the <ORG> Rules <ORG> hereby exempts goods falling under Item No of the First Schedule to the <ORG>s and Salt Act and cleared for home consumption on or after the first day of April in any financial year by or on behalf of manufacturer from one or more factories from the whole of the duty of excise leviable thereon if an officer not below the rank of an Assistant Collector of <ORG> is satisfied that the sum total of the value of the capital investment made from time to time on plant and machinery installed in the industrial unit in which the goods under clearance are manufactured is not more than Rupees Ten lakhs Provided that this exemption shall not be applicable to a manufacturer if the total value of all excisable goods cleared by him or on his behalf in the preceding financial year had exceeded Rupees Thirty Lakhs Provided further that the exemption contained to this notification shall apply only to the first clearance for home consumption by or on behalf of the manufacturer referred to in this notification from one or more factories upto a value not exceeding Rupees Thirty Lakhs during a financial year subsequent to and upto a value not exceeding rupees Twenty four lakhs during the period commencing on the th day of June and ending on the st day of March Explanation For the purposes of determining the value of any capital investment only the face value of such investment at the time when such investment was made shall be taken into account It is not disputed that the goods falling under item no of the First Schedule relating to the mills are for home consumption and that the capital investment made from time to time on plant and machinery installed in the industrial unit of the mills in which the goods are manufactured is more than Rupees Ten Lakhs According to Mr <NAME> the word cleared in the Rules and Notifications issued thereunder is used only for those excisable goods on which excise duty is actually paid and as no excise duty has to be paid on Maida it would not be included in the expression all excisable goods cleared Therefore excisable goods cleared will only mean those excisable goods on which excise duty is payable and has been paid that is is free from obstruction or obligation or encumbrance In this context reference was made to Rule of the Rules which provides that excisable goods shall not be removed from any place where they are produced cured or manufactured or any premises appurtenant thereto which may be specified by the Collector in this behalf whether for consumption export or manufacture of any other commodity until the excise duty leviable thereon has been paid at such place and in such manner as is prescribed in these Rules or as the Collector may require Rule further provides that when a manufacturer desires to remove the goods on payment of duty either from the place or premises specified under Rule or from a store room or other place of storage approved by the Collector he shall make an application in triplicate to the proper officer in the proper form and shall deliver it to the officer at least hours before it is intended to remove the goods The officer shall thereupon assess the amount of duty due on the goods and on production of evidence that the same has been paid into the treasury or paid to the account of the Collector in <ORG> or <ORG> allow the goods to be cleared Placing reliance upon this provision Mr <NAME> submitted that the word cleared is used to signify permission to remove such excisable goods only after payment of excise duty meaning thereby only after excise duty levied has already been paid Rule A provides for goods to be delivered on gate pass and sub rule reads thus Gate passes shall be maintained in two sets one for clearance for home consumption and the other for clearance for export Each gate pass shall bear a printed serial number running for the whole year beginning on the first January or such other date as approved by the proper officer as may correspond to the accounting year of the factory It has therefore been urged before us that the word cleared as used in the notification signifies the removal of an obstruction which is in the way on account of the imposition of excise duty and which obstruction is removed when the excise duty has been paid The learned Standing Counsel on the other hand contends that the word cleared used in the notification has no special or particular meaning He further emphasises that the word cleared as used in the proviso could not relate to excise duty actually paid as the expression used in the proviso is all excisable goods cleared by him It is said that the clearance refers to the clearance by the manufacturer and therefore the word cleared here means removed The submissions made by both sides are plausible If the <ORG> satisfies the <ORG> that the case falls strictly within the provisions of the law the subject can be taxed If on the other hand the case is not covered within the four corners of the provisions of the taxaing Statute no tax can be imposed by inference or by analogy or by trying to probe into the intentions of the legislature and by considering what was the substance of the matter Reverting to the first submission Section reads excisable goods specified in the First Schedule as being subject to duty of excise and includes salt On behalf of the petitioners it is said that excisable goods under the definition has two attributes namely i goods which are specified in the First Schedule of the Act and ii which are subject to a duty of excise There are some goods mentioned therein where the duty of excise is nil as for example item No i unmanufactured tobacco if used for agricultural purpose It is further submitted that even if there are goods in the First Schedule which are subject to a duty of excise such duty at times is exempted under Rule of the Rules This report was not available here but a copy of the judgment was given to us where it was observed On this observation it is arguable that the goods manufactured by the petitioner ceased to be excisable goods after they were exempted from payment of duty for the exemption notification was entitled to be regarded as part of the Act itself He has submitted that from the year itself when the Act was first made there was at least one item in the Schedule where the duty of excise was nil which was item Palmyra Sugar It is further argued that when the rate of excise duty is prescribed under the Schedule of the Act then such goods are subject to a duty of excise and if some of those goods are exempted by a notification under Rule they still continue to be excisable goods on which excise duty is exempted As I have already held that the petitioners are entitled to the relief sought for in this application as at present advised I do not consider it necessary to decide this point In the result this application is allowed and the impugned order is quashed and set aside In the circumstances of the case however I would make no order as to costs <NAME> I agree with my learned brother on both the questions decided by him but I would like to add a few words With respect to the preliminary objection taken by the Standing Counsel appearing on behalf of <ORG> regarding the maintainability of the writ application Mr <NAME> contended that in the facts and circumstances of the case the provisions for appeal and revision do not provide an effective alternative remedy and since no investigation of fact is involved in the case this <ORG> should not refuse to exercise its constitutional powers He also cited a number of decisions in support of his argument Mr <NAME> advanced a further argument that as the writ application was admitted by this Court it should not be dismissed on the basis of the preliminary objection now High Court he approached <ORG> and was granted special leave <ORG> accepted the claim of the appellant allowed the appeal and while so doing held as under It is true that a petition to revise the order could be moved before the Commissioner of Income Tax If <ORG> had not entertained his petition <NAME> could have moved the Commissioner in revision because at the date on which the petition was move the period prescribed by Section A of the Act had not expired to hold that because a revision application could have been moved for an order correcting the order of the Income Tax Officer under Section but was not moved <ORG> would be justified in dismissing as not maintainable the petition which was entertained and was heard on the merits The petitioner had approached <ORG> within the period prescribed for filing the appeal and the writ application was admitted and was heard after the expiry of the said period Relying upon the decision of <ORG> in <NAME> case supra <ORG> held that the writ petition could not be dismissed on the ground of alternative remedy In the present case also the petitioner filed a wait application before the expiry of the period of limitation which is admittedly three months as mentioned in Section and the case was admitted and an interim order was passed Now when the period of limitation is over it will not be a proper exercise of the jurisdiction to dismiss the application merely on the ground that the petitioner should have filed an appeal The preliminary objection raised on behalf of the respondents must therefore be rejected I entirely agree with the view expressed by my learned Brother on the second point urged on behalf of the petitioner as discussed in paragraphs to of his judgment I wish to express my opinion on the first question raised on behalf of the petitioners also as formulated in paragraph of the judgment of my learned Brother The expression excisable goods has been defined in Section in the following terms Excisable goods means goods specified in the First Schedule as being subject to a duty of excise and includes salt Mr <NAME> contended that after exemption was granted with respect to <ORG> by Annexure the article ceased to be subject to a duty of excise and consequently cannot be assumed to be covered by the expression The factual position in this case admittedly is that if the sale of <ORG> in the preceding financial year is taken into account the total turnover would exceed Rs lakhs but if <ORG> be excluded the turnover will be below that figure and consequently the first proviso in annexure would have no application at all The learned counsel also tried to take help from the language used in Section as it stood earlier and as it now stands after amendment He said that if the intention was to include within the expression all the articles specified in the First Schedule then there was no necessity of including the words as being subject to a duty of excise in the definition Mr <NAME> strenuously contended on the well established principles of interpretation that the legislature must be presumed to have used each word in a Statute for a purpose and that every part of a statutory provision should be given effect to It was urged that if the intention had been to treat every article mentioned in the schedule as excisable goods without reference to the question as to whether duty was payable or not it could have been expressed in a more direct straight forward manner without unnecessarily making a reference to payment of duty On a close examination of the Act along with the First Schedule arid the rules I do not find myself in a position to accept the petitioner stand It is true that the expression is not intended to include every article mentioned in the First Schedule but at the same time it is also clear that the definition is not entirely dependent upon liability to pay duty for if that were so the sub section would not have mentioned the First Schedule A reference has been made to both the First Schedule and to the liability in regard to the excise duty and they have been connected by the every significant words as being Giving effect to every word in the sub section its meaning appears to be that all goods which are subject to duty by virtue of being included in the First Schedule must be treated as excisable Let us test the conclusion to which I have arrived above in the light of the argument addressed on behalf of the petitioner In Item No several articles are excluded from the duty and even before this item was included in the Schedule there was other articles not subject to duty I therefore do not find any substance in the first point urged on behalf of the petitioner However since the second question has been decided in its favour the writ application succeeds
