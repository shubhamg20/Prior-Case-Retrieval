The question involved in all the four Petitions was whether tanned leather can be subjected to Uttar Pradesh Mandi Fee payable under the provisions of Krishi Utapadan Mandi Adhiniyam hereinafter for the sake of convenience called the said Act For an understanding of this question it is necessary to see Section a of the said Act which reads as follows Agricultural produce means such items of produce of agriculture horticulture viticulture apiculture sericulture pisciculture animal husbandry or forest as are specified in the Schedule and includes admixture of two or more of such items and also includes any such item in processed form and further includes Gur Rab Shakkar Kandsari and jaggery The question which had been raised in the Writ Petitions and which is raised here is whether the term hides and skins includes tanned leather He admits that under Section a not just the items which have been specified in the Schedule but also an admixture of two or more such items or any of those items in a processed form would also be included They purchased raw skins from places both within and outside the State of Madras tanned those skins and sold them through their agents in Madras They were assessed to sales tax under the provisions of the Madras General Sales Tax Act and under rules ii of the Madras General Sales Tax Turnover and Assessment Rules They filed the Petition under Article contending that Section of the Madras General Sales Tax Special Provisions Act was ultra vires the Constitution That challenge was upheld on the ground that Section discriminated against imported hides and skins and local hides and skins Under the Rules tax was levied on sale of hides and skins in raw condition but no tax was levied on sale of hides and skins in tanned condition Therefore the Rules themselves made a distinction between hides and skins in raw condition and hides and skins in tanned condition It was contended that hides and skins whether tanned or untanned constituted one commodity and therefore there could be no tax on sales of hides and skins in raw condition when there was no tax on sale of hides and skins in tanned condition It may be noted that it was so held in the context of the definition as given in Item of the Second Schedule of the said Act which provided both for raw hides and skins as well as dressed hides and skins Thus the Act itself made a distinction between raw hides and skins and dressed hides and skins It was held that flour maida or suji were not included in the Act and they would not fall within the term Wheat as defined in the Act This <ORG> held that even though these Frooti and Appy were manufactured out of mango pulp and apple concentrate but after the mango pulp and apple concentrates were processed and beverages were manufactured the products becomes entirely different from the fruits that is the mango and apple It was held that even though the basic character of the mango pulp and apple concentrate may be present in beverages but the end products were not fruits which were specified in the Schedule In this case the question was whether an industry which manufactures sugar from sugar cane was covered by Entry of Schedule I to the Water Prevention and Control of Pollution Cess Act The <ORG> held that processing essentially effectuates a change in form contour physical appearance or chemical combination or otherwise by artificial or natural means The <ORG> held that a manufacture implies a change but that every change was not manufacture The <ORG> held that for manufacture something more was necessary and that there must be a transformation and a new and distinct article must emerge having a distinctive name character or use Based on this authority it was submitted that tanned leather was a different article and a distinctive commodity having a distinctive name character and use and that tanned leather was a manufactured item Tanned leather retains its basic character namely it remains hide or skin though there is some change in form and physical appearance Lastly reliance was placed upon the case of <ORG> and another etc In this case it was held that processing cannot be equated to manufacture It was held that the word manufacture is generally understood to mean as bringing into existence a new substance and does not mean merely to produce some change in a substance In our view this authority would also show that in fact there is no manufacture but mere processing of hides and skins to bring them into a tanned state As against this Mr <NAME> submitted that definitions and meanings given in other Acts or in the context of other Acts can be of no assistance He submits that one has to look at the provisions of the said Act itself He submitted that the term agricultural produce had been given a wide meaning in Section a of the said Act He submits that any item would be an agricultural produce if it is specified in the Schedule or if it is an admixture of two or more items specified in the Schedule or if it is a processed form of any of the items specified in the Schedule He admits that if there was a conflict between an Hindi version and an English version then by virtue of Article of the Constitution of India the English version would prevail He submits that if there is no conflict then the Hindi version can be looked at in order to determine any ambiguity or to find out if any item is included or not This <ORG> held that to resolve a controversy of this nature one has to seek light from the definition of expression agricultural produce as set out in Section a of the Act It was held that it was an indisputable canon of construction that where an expression is defined in the statute unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context the expression had to be construed as having the same meaning assigned to it in the dictionary clause of the statute It was held that Dal was nothing else but a whole grain split into two folds in its processed form acquired by manufacturing process and that was therefore an agricultural produce This very conclusion can be reached by a slightly different route As is well known the legislative enactments in the State of <ORG> are enacted primarily in Hindi language and its official and authentic translation in English is simultaneously published Bearing this in mind we turn to the notification dated April specifying legumes therein enumerated as specified agricultural produce for various Market Areas This tongue twister was explained to us to mean that legume itself is Dwi Daliya Utpadan i the whole grain is made of two folds Dwi Daliya is a grain composed of two folds and certainly not many folds Concise Oxford Dictionary specifies the meaning of legume to be fruit edible part pod of leguminous plant vegetable used for food and leguminous to mean like of the botanical family of pulse And in common parlance pulse connotes legume and denotes dal of legume Reverting however to the heading under which legumes are enumerated in notification it must be confessed that it clearly connotes the meaning to be given to the whole grain and denotes dal i split folds as specified agricultural produce The Hindi protagonists used the expression Dwi Daliya Utpadan meaning thereby double folded grain called Gram Peas Arhar Moong etc on a strict construction the two dals i two parts forming the whole grain both are comprehended in the expression Dwi Daliya Utpadan Therefore it is crystal clear that while enumerating legumes in the Schedule and reproduced in the notification to make them specified agricultural produce the framers intended to include both the grain as a whole and its split parts the dal And when the agricultural produce enumerated in the Schedule such as Gram including its processed part is reproduced in the notification as Dwi Daliya Utpadan the dal of each of the legumes therein mentioned became specified agricultural produce This contention was negatived and it was held that khandsari was a genus and khandsari sugar was a species and in the market both were merely known as khandsari The juice was then thickened by dehydration and when it reached a particular pigment it took the form of rab which is a semi solid form of the sugarcane juice After boiling this rab was put in a crystalliser where it was allowed to get cooled and crystals were formed which were then rotated in the crystalliser The crystallised rab was then put into centrifugal machines in which through the process of infusion of sulphur the sugarcane juice was cleaned and whitened The rab which was not put into the centrifugal machine but which was dehydrated and allowed to be hardened by the open pan process became gur which was sold for home consumption The rab which was not allowed to be hardened was also sold in semi solid form but certain persons who wanted to make further profits put this rab into centrifugal machines and by the process of infusion of sulphur they obtained khandsari in the dry powder crystallised form and the waste of rab which was obtained in the liquid form known as molasses This then was also sold in the market as inferior quality called rab galawat It was held that there was a further inferior quality of rab called rab salawat This <ORG> held that a wide interpretation had to be given to Section a of the said Act as the meaning was exhaustive and not restricted to the items included in the Schedule It was held that items which came into being in a processed form would be included In this behalf he showed to the <ORG> the paragraphs and which read as follows Turning to coloured leather we may at the outset refer to a very important circumstance referred to by the respondents When the CST Act came into force on April a question was raised regarding the meaning of the expression hides and skins in dressed state used in Section The matter was referred to the leather development wing of <ORG> which gave the following opinion Hides and skins are obtained from either slaughtered or dead animals Since tanneries are not always located very near the source of raw hides and skins the question of preserving them for a temporary period till they reach a tanning centre assumes importance Raw hides and skins are cured by either wet salting dry salting or drying In the cured state the raw materials can be preserved for a temporary period These tanned hides and skins are processed further to yield Dressed Hides and Skins which are ready for use Dressed or finished material could also be preserved almost indefinitely From the above it will be seen that the expressing Hides and skins in the raw or dressed state refers at one end to the raw material obtained from the slaughtered or dead animals and at the other to the tanned and finished material the expression therefore seems to include the other intermediate stages indicated in the previous paragraphs Dressing according to the authoritative interpretations would mean the conversion of tanned hides and skins by further suitable processing into leathers of different types which are ready for use vide SBT of November The statutory expression refers to hides and skins in a dressed state The guidelines issued for identification of finished leather for exports by <ORG> <ORG> refer to as many as operations or processes undergone during manufacture of finished leather but dressing is not one of them A glossary of terms relating to hides skins and leather published by the <ORG> in contains the following definitions CRUSTS Crust Leather Tanned hides and skins without any finish CURRYING A series of dressing and finishing processes applied to leather after tanning in the course of which appropriate amounts of oils and greases are incorporated in the leather to give it increased tensile strength flexibility and water resisting properties DRESSED HIDES Tanned hides curried or otherwise finished for various purposes such as belting harness and saddlery travel goods and for upholstery DRESSING LEATHER Vegetable tanned hides which may be dressed to suit the purpose for which they are to be used such as for harness saddlery and other mechanical purposes LEATHER The skin or hide of animals prepared by tanning which still retains its original fibrous structure more or less intact but from which hair or wool may or may not have been removed and which has been treated so as to be imputrescible even after treatment with water The earlier glossary of such terms published by <ORG> defines dressing as a general term for the series of processes employed to convert certain rough tanned hides and skins and or crust leather into leather ready for use Also Leather is defined as a general term for hide or skin which still retains its original fibrous structure more or less intact and which has been treated so as to be imputrescible even after treatment with water Certain skins similarly treated or dressed and without the hair removed are termed fur The Dictionary of Leather Terminology published by <ORG> describes leather as the hide and skin of any animal or any portion of such skin when tanned tawed or otherwise dressed for use The above definitions show that hides and skins acquire the name of leather even if the hair or wool has not been removed therefrom as soon as they receive some treatment which prevents them from putrefaction after treatment with water Volume of <ORG> under the word dress explains that the verb has various applications which can be deduced from its original meaning and that it is thus used not only of the putting on of the clothing but of the preparing and finishing of leather Volume under the head leather details the various processes applied in the treatment of hides and skins at all stages pre tanning tanning and post tanning Dyeing or colouring is a process which follows tanning but precedes finishing i dressing in order to make it suitable for the purpose which it is required in commercial usage Part of the Wealth of India a publication of <ORG> dealing with leather under Industrial Products explains that hides and skins are liable to putrefaction and loss unless suitably treated and converted into leather Structurally hides and skins have a thick middle layer called corium which is converted to leather by tanning The operations involved in leather manufacture however fall into three groups Pre tanning operations includes soaking liming de liming bating and pickling and post tanning operations are splitting and shaving neutralising bleaching dyeing fat liquoring and stuffing setting out samming drying staking and finishing These operations bring about Chemical changes in the leather substance and influence the physical characteristics of the leather and different varieties of commercial leather are obtained by suitably adjusting the manufacturing operations These processes need not be gone into in detail but the passages relied upon clearly show that hides and skins are termed leather even as soon as the process of tanning is over and the danger of their putrefaction is put an end to The entry in the CST Act however includes within its scope hides and skins until they are dressed This as we have seen represents the stage when they undergo the process of finishing and assume a form in which they can be readily utilised for manufacture of various commercial articles The statutory entry is comprehensive enough to include the products emerging from hides and skins until the process of dressing or finishing is done Mr <NAME> submitted that tanned leather would be covered by the definition of the term Agricultural produce as defined in Section a of the Act He submitted that cases relied upon by the Appellants were of no help as all of them were under taxing statutes and were merely interpreting terms in the context of the definitions given in those statutes We have considered the arguments of both the parties In our view it is clear that the interpretation has to be on the basis of the expression Agricultural produce as set out in Section a of the said Act All the cases relied upon by Mr <NAME> are cases under the taxing statutes where the interpretation has been given on the basis of the terms as defined in those statutes A perusal of Section a of the said Act makes it clear that an agricultural product would be a product which is specified in the Schedule or one which is admixture of two or more items and would also include any such item in a processed form In our view it makes no difference for the purposes of the said Act that the concerned item is a different commodity from the one which is included in the Schedule It is possible that by virtue of an admixture of two or more items or by virtue of processing a different commodity or item may come into existence Even though a different commodity may come into existence it would still be an Agricultural produce The specific inclusion of items like gur rab shakkar khandsari and jaggery is to make it clear that merely because it becomes a different item or commodity it is not excluded We see no reason to go into the difference between manufacturing and processing For this reason we are of the opinion that there is no illegality or infirmity in the judgment of <ORG> Undoubtedly if there is conflict between the two than the English version would prevail However if there is no conflict then one can always have assistance of the Hindi version in order to find out whether the word used in English includes a particular item or not
