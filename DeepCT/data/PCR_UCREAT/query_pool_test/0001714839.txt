Practice and procedure Undertaking given by the parties directions given by <ORG> Effect of The cess was levied by these <ORG>s under their respective statutes viz Against the decision of <ORG> the assessees have filed appeal in this <ORG> whereas the <ORG> of Orissa has filed a cross appeal Against the decision of <ORG> the assessee has filed an appeal in this court In appeal to this court it was contended on behalf of the <ORG> of Orissa that i the levy of cess being referable to Entries and of the <ORG> List of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution the impugned legislation was within the legislative competence of the <ORG> legislature ii the limitations imposed in the statute on the modes of utilisation of cess supports a view that the cess is fee on which the <ORG> legislature is competent to legislate under Entry read with Entry of the <ORG> List iii since the impugned Act was concerned with the raising of funds to enable panchayats and Samithis to discharge their responsibilities of local administration and take steps for proper development of the area under their jurisdiction the impugned legislation was referable to Entry of <ORG> List and iv the enactment of the Central Legislation viz Mines and Minerals Regulation and Development Act has not denuded the <ORG> legislation of its competence to enact the impugned legislation since the scope and subject matter of the two legislations are entirely different and the impugned <ORG> Legislation does not encroach upon the field covered by the Central Legislation i Act On behalf of the assessees it was contended inter alia that i all the <ORG> levies were ultra vires for the reasons given by this <ORG> in the <ORG> case ii the <ORG> cannot seek to sustain the levy under the Bengal Cess Act by relying on Article of the Constitution and iii the levy being unconstitutional the <ORG> should direct the <ORG>s to refund the cess collected from the assessees because a a refund is the automatic and inevitable consequence of the declaration of invalidity of tax and the <ORG>s have given undertakings before this <ORG> that they would refund the amount collected in case the levy is declared invalid by this <ORG> Even otherwise the competence of <ORG> under the said Entry is circumscribed by any limitations imposed by <ORG> by law relating to mineral development The Mines and Minerals Regulation and Development Act is a law of <ORG> relating to mineral development and Section of the said Act empowers <ORG> to fix alter enhance or reduce the rates of royalty payable in respect of minerals removed from the land or consumed by the lessee Sub Section of Section in terms <ORG>s that the royalties payable under the Second Schedule to that Act shall not be enhanced more than once during a period of three years There is a difference in principle between a tax on royalties derived from land and a tax on land measured by reference to the income derived therefrom But in the impugned legislation the levy is not measured by the income derived by the assessee from the land as is the case with lands other than mineral lands There is a clear distinction between tax on land and tax on income arising from land A Section of the Orissa Cess Act earmarks the purposes of utilisation of only fifty per cent of the proceeds of the cess and that too is limited to the cess collected in respect of lands other than lands held for carrying on mining operations Therefore the levy cannot be correlated to any services rendered or to be rendered by the <ORG> to the class of persons from whom the levy is collected Even assuming that the levy is a fee the <ORG> legislature can impose a fee only in respect of any of the matters in the <ORG> List Under Entry of List I regulation of mines and mineral development is in the field of parliamentary legislation to the extent to which such regulation and development under the control of the <ORG> is declared by <ORG> by law to be expedient in the public interest There is a difference between the object of the Act and its subject The object of the levy may be to strengthen the finances of local bodies but the Act has nothing to do with municipal or local administration The answer to the question whether <ORG> was denuded of its competence to enact the impugned legislation because of the <ORG> having enacted the Mines and Minerals Regulation and Development Act depends on a proper understanding of the scope of the Act and an assessment of the encroachment made by the impugned <ORG> legislation into the field covered by it The mere declaration of a law of <ORG> that it is expedient for an industry or the regulation and development of miners and minerals to be under the control of the <ORG> under Entry or entry of List I does not denude the <ORG> legislatures of their legislative powers with respect to the fields covered by the several entries in List II or List III Particularly in the case of a declaration under Entry this legislative power is eroded only to the extent control is assumed by the <ORG> pursuance to such declaration as spelt out by the legislative enactment which makes the declaration In assessing the field covered by the Act of <ORG> in question one should be guided not merely by the actual provisions of the Central Act or the rules made thereunder but should also take into account matters and aspect which can legitimately be brought within the scope of the said statute The different notifications issued by the <ORG> of Bihar under section of the Act determining the rate of cess on the amount of rayalty of all minerals of the <ORG> place the matter beyond all doubt There are no clear indications in the statute that the amounts are collected by way of fee and not tax Although there is no provision for the constitution of a separate fund for this purpose as is found in relation to the cesses levied under Part II or Part III of the Act yet this consideration alone does not preclude the levy from being considered as a fee Therefore a finding regarding the invalidity of a levy need not automatically result in direction for a refund of all collections thereof made made earlier The declaration regarding the invalidity of a provision and the determination of the relief that should be granted in consequence thereof are two deferent things and in the latter sphere the <ORG> has and must be held to have a certain amount of discretion Once the principle that the <ORG> has a discretion to grant or decline refund is recognised the ground on which such discretion should be exercised is a matter of consideration for the <ORG> having regard to all the circumstances of the case The <ORG> can grant would or restrict the relief in a manner most appropriate to the situation before it is such a way as to advance the interests of justice Also there is no reason why the vital interest of the <ORG> should not be a relevant criterion for deciding that a refund should not be granted A In the instant case though the levy of the cess is unconstitutional yet there shall be no direction to refund to the assessees of any amounts of cess collected until the date on which the levy in question has been declared unconstitutional The dates of the judgments of the appropriate High <ORG> may not constitute a declaration of law within the scope of Article of the Constitution but it cannot be gainsaid that the <ORG> cannot on any ground of equity be permitted to retain the cess collected on and after the date of <ORG> judgment Accordingly the <ORG> should refund the amounts of cess collected after the relevant dates to assesses directly or in the Coalfields from whom they were collected with interest at the rate directed by this <ORG> or mentioned in the undertaking from the date of the relevant judgment to the actual date of repayment The undertaking given by the parties or interim directions given by the <ORG> cannot be understood in such a manner as to conflict with the <ORG> final decision The Judgment of the Court was delivered by RANGANATHAN These are connected batches of Civil Appeals and Special Leave Petitions We grant special leave to appeal in all the petitions condoning the delay in the filing of the unnumbered one referred to below and proceed to dispose of all the appeals by this common judgment THE ISSUE The validity of the levy of a cess based on the royalty derived from mining lands by the <ORG>s of Bihar Orissa and Madhya Pradesh is challenged in these petitions and appeals However the basic issue being the same all these matters have been heard together and it is found convenient to dispose of them all by this common judgment THE LEGISLATIVE ENTRIES It will be convenient at the outset to refer to the various entries of the <ORG> and the State Lists in the Seventh Schedule to the constitution which have a bearing on the issues to be discussed These are List I Union List Entry Industries the control of which by the <ORG> declared by <ORG> by law to be expedient in the public interest Entry Regulation of mines and mineral development to the extent to which such regulation and development under the control of <ORG> is declared by <ORG> by law to be expedient in the public interest List II State List Entry Land that is to say rights in or over land land tenures including the relation of landlord and tenant and the collection of rents transfer and alienation of agricultural land improvement and agricultural land colonization Entry Taxes on mineral rights subject to nay limitations imposed by <ORG> by law relating to mineral development Entry Fees in respect of any of the matters in this List but not including fees taken in any court <NAME> Case As early as in this Court had to consider the constitutional validity of <ORG> Act Orissa Act XXVII of of the Act empowered <ORG> to constitute mining areas whenever it appeared to the <ORG> that it was necessary and expedient to provide amenities life communications water supply and electricity for the better development of such areas or to provide for the welfare of the residents or workers in areas within which persons employed in a mine or a group of mines reside or work The fund has to be utilised to meet expenditure incurred in connection with such development measures as <ORG> might draw up for the purposes above mentioned as well as for the purposes specified in clauses a to of The validity of this levy of cess was challenged by the petitioner coal company in the <NAME> case as ultra vires the powers of <ORG> because a the cess was not a fee but a duty of excise on coal which was a field covered by Entry of List I in the Seventh Schedule and repugnant to the Local Mines Labour Welfare Fund Act Central Act XXXII of and even if it was treated as a fee relatable to Entries and of List II in the Seventh Schedule it was hit by Entry of List I read with the Mines and Minerals Development Regulation Act Central Act LIII of the MMRD Act for short or by Entry of List I read with the Industries Development and Regulation Act the IDR Act for short Central ACt LXV of This argument was based on two considerations The first related to the form and the second to the extent of the levy Repelling the argument it was held that the extent of levy of a fee would always depend upon the nature of the services intended to be rendered and the financial obligations incurred thereby and cannot by itself alter the character of the levy from a fee into the of a duty of excise except where the correlation between the levy and services is not genuine or real or where the levy is disproportionately higher than the requirements of the services intended to be rendered So far as the first consideration was concerned it was observed that the method in which the fee is recovered is a matter of convenience and by itself it cannot fix upon the levy the character of a duty of excise The court therefore came to the conclusion that the cess levied by the impugned act was neither a tax nor a duty of excise but a fee The second argument turned on the impact of the MMRD Act on the State power to levy a fee under Entry read with Entry of List II as a consequence of the declaration contained in of the Central Act In other words if a Central Act has been passed which contains a declaration by <ORG> as required by Entry and if the said declaration covers the field occupied by the impugned Act the impugned Act would be ultra vires not because of any repugnance between the two statutes but because <ORG> had no jurisdiction to pass the law It proceeded to review the provisions of Central ACt LIII of and concluded that if this Act were held to contain the declaration referred to in Entry there would be no difficulty in holding that the declaration covered the field of conservation and development of minerals and that the said field was indistinguishable from the field covered by the impugned Act In coming to this conclusion the <ORG> pointed out that the rule making powers conferred on <ORG> under Section of the Act included the levy and collection of royalties fees and taxes in respect of minerals mines quarried excavated or collected The circumstance that no rules had in fact been framed by <ORG> in regard to the levy and collection of any fees it was held would not make any difference The <ORG> observed What Entry provides is that the legislative competence of <ORG> is subject to the provisions of List I with respect to regulation and development under the con trol of the <ORG> and Entry in List I requires a declaration by <ORG> by law that regulation and development of mines should be under the control of the <ORG> in public interest Therefore if a Central Act has been passed for the purpose of providing for the conservation and development of minerals and if it contains the requisite declaration then it would not be competent to <ORG> to pass an Act in respect of the subject matter covered by the said declaration In order that the declaration should be effective it is not necessary that rules should be made or enforced all that this required is a declaration by <ORG> that it is expedient in the public interest to take the regulation and development of mines under the control of the <ORG> In such a case the test must be whether the legislative declaration covers the field or not The Court then considered the argument based on Entry of List I and the provisions of the IDR Act but came to the conclusion that the vires of the impugned Act could not be successfully challenged on this ground He pointed out at how taxes could be turned into fees on the so called basis of quantification with the help of the device of creating a fund and attaching certain services to be rendered out of monies in the fund He was of opinion that the expressions taxes on mineral rights referred to taxes on the right to extract minerals and not taxes on the minerals actually extracted It was no different in pith and substance from a a tax on goods produced which comes under Item of List I as duty of excise The same issue regarding the competence of <ORG> to levy the very same cess came up for consideration again in the Tulloch case The Act which had earlier provided for the regulation of mines and oil fields and for the development of minerals was now limited only to oil fields and the Act provided for the regulation of mines and mineral development of the Act like the predecessor Act contained the following declaration in terms of Entry of List I It read It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that the <ORG> should take under its control the regulation of mines and the development of minerals to the extent hereinafter provided but unlike the earlier one this was a declaration contained in an Act of Parliament which had the effect of impairing the legislative competence of the <ORG> under Entry read with Entry of the <ORG> List The hurdle which prevented <ORG> from considering the provisions of the Act as a bar to the levy of the cess was therefore out of the way The Court analysed in detail the provisions of the impugned <ORG> Act as well as the two Central Act It referred to its conclusion in the <ORG> case that the field covered by the impugned <ORG> Act was covered by the Act and observed that this fully applied to the <ORG> Act vis a vis the Act also particularly as Ss and of the Act were wider in scope and amplitude and conferred larger powers on <ORG> than the corresponding provisions of the Act though not as categorically as of the Act clearly implied a power to levy rent royalty tax fee and other sums a nd besides of the Central Act of were wider in scope and amplitude and conferred larger powers on <ORG> than the corresponding provisions of the Act of the Central Act would not cover the field Repugnancy arises when two enactments both within the competence of the two Legislatures collide and when the Constitution expressly or by necessary implication provides that the enactment of one legislature has superiority over the other then to the extent of the repugnancy the one supersedes the other The test of two legislations containing contradictory for if a competent legislature with a superior efficacy expressly or impliedly evinces by its legislation an intention to cover the whole field the enactments of the other legislature whether passed before or after would be overborne on the ground of repugnance Where such is the position the inconsistency is demonstrated not by a detailed comparison of provisions of the two statutes but by the mere existence of the two pieces of legislation In the present case having regard to the terms of it appears clear to us that the intention of <ORG> was to cover the entire field and thus to leave no scope for the argument that until rules were framed there was no inconsistency and no supersession of the State Act Meeting the argument that the power to levy a fee was an independent head of legislative power under each of the three legislative lists and that the levy of tax undue the State Act could be traced to this entry the <ORG> pointed out the fallacy underlying the argument in the following words The materials words of the Entries are Fees in respect of any of the matters in this List If by reason of the declaration by <ORG> the entire subject matter of conservation and development of minerals has been taken over for being dealt with by <ORG> thus depriving the <ORG> of the power which it theretofore possessed it would follow that the matter in the <ORG> List is to the extent of the declaration subtracted from the scope and ambit of Entry of the <ORG> List The result was that <NAME> declared the levy of the cess to be invalid and it was held that as and from the date on which the Act came into force the Orissa Act should be deemed to be non existent for every purpose The appellant held certain lands under a mining lease for extraction of iron ore from the <ORG> which stipulated for the payment of a stipulated amount of dead rent a royalty on the basis of every ton of ore mined as well as a surface rent per acre of the surface area occupied or used The appellant was therefore called upon to pay a cess based on the royalty paid by him to the State <ORG> of Andhra Pradesh which had succeeded to the State of Madras in respect of the territories in question and it was the validity of this levy which was upheld by <ORG> that came up for the consideration of this Court It was contended on behalf of the appellant relying on Hingir Rampur and <NAME> that the provision imposing land cess quoad royalty must be held to be repealed by MMRD Act of or in any event by the MMRD Act Central Act LXVII of and that after the date when these enactments came into force the land cess that could be levied must be exclusive of royalty under a mining lease Distinguishing the decisions cited this Court rejected the contention It observed It will be seen that there is no resemblance whatever between the provision of the Orissa Act considered in the two decisions and the provision for the levy of the land cess under ss and of the Act with which we are concerned Sections and have nothing to do and are not concerned with the development of mines and minerals or their regulation The proceeds of the land cess are under of the Act to be credited to the District fund into which under the terms of the Finance Rules in to the Act the land cess as well as several other taxes fees and receipts are directed to be credited This fund is to be used under Ch VII of the Act with which starts for everything necessary for or conducive to the safety health convenience or education of the inhabitants or the amenities of the local area concerned and everything incidental to the administration and include in particular the several matters which are mentioned in those sections It will thus be seen that there is no connection between the regulation and development of mines and collection of land cess for which provision is made by ss and of the Act There is therefore no scope at all for the argument that there is anything in common between the Act and the Central Act of and so as to require any detailed examination of these enactments for discovering whether there is any over lapping A second contention raised before the <ORG> was that as the impugned land cess was payable only in the event of the lessee winning the mineral and not when no minerals were extracted it was in effect a tax on the minerals won and therefore on mineral rights No doubt in a sense but in a very remote sense it has relationship to mining as also to the mineral won from the mine under a contract by which royally is payable on the quantity of mineral extracted But that does not stamp it as a tax on either the extraction of the mineral or on the mineral right It is unnecessary for the purpose of this case to examine the question as to what exactly is a tax on mineral rights seeing that such a tax is not leviable by <ORG> but only by the <ORG> and the sole limitation on the <ORG> power to levy the tax is that it must not interfere with a law made by <ORG> as regards mineral development Our attention was not invited to the provision of any such law enacted by <ORG> Under of the Act the cess is levied on occupied land on whatever tenure held This being the basis of the Tax and disclosing its true nature provides for the manner in which the annual rent value is determined i what is the amount for which the land could reasonably be let the benefit to the lessor representing the rateable value or the annual rent value In the case of ryotwari lands it is the assessment which is payable to the <ORG> that is taken as the rental value being the benefit that accrues to the <ORG> Where the land is held under lease it is the lease amount that forms the basis Where land is held under a mining lease that which the occupier is willing to pay is accordingly treated as the annual rent value of the property Such a rent value would therefore necessarily include not merely the surface rent but the dead rent as well as the royalty payable by the licensee lessee or occupier for the user of the property The position then is that the rent which a tenant might be expected to pay for the property is in the case of lease hold interests treated as the statutory annual rent value It is therefore not possible to accept the contention that the fact that the lessee or licensee pays a royalty on the mineral won which extended only to the mere use of the surface land places it in a category different from other types where the lessee uses the surface of the land alone In each case the rent which a lessee or licensee actually pays for the land being the test it is manifest that the land cess is nothing else except a land tax The judgment of <ORG> in the <NAME> case supra held the field from to We have already referred to the cess levied in Orissa which came to be considered by this Court as early as and in the Hingir Rampur and Tulloch cases Further cases came up for consideration on the same lines in Bihar <ORG> v<ORG> of Bihar decided on the subject matter of A before us in Orissa <NAME> <ORG> A I Ori provided that the local cess will be deemed to be public revenue and all the lands and buildings thereon shall be regarded as security therefore Apparently inspired by the decision in <NAME> the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Amendment and Miscellaneous Provisions Act Tamil Nadu Act of added with full retrospective effect the following Explanation to Explanation In this section and in Section land revenue means public revenue due on land and includes water cess payable to the government for water supplied or used for the irrigation of land royalty lease amount or other sums payable to the government in respect of land held direct from the government on lease or licence but does not include any other cess or the surcharge payable under Section provided that lands revenue remitted shall not be deemed to be land revenue payable for the purpose of this section The appeal to this <ORG> was referred to a Bench of seven Judges who came to the conclusion that <NAME> dity of the levy of the cess The levy could not be supported under a Entry of List II as it is not a tax on land revenue an expression which has a well defined connotation The Explanation to itself proceeds on the basis that royalty cannot be land revenue properly so called or conventionally so known A tax on land can only be levied on tax as a unit must be imposed directly on land and must bear a definite relationship to it There is a clear distinction between a tax directly on land and a tax on income arising from land The cess is not a tax directly on land as a unit but only a tax on royalty which is indirectly connected with land In the view taken by the <ORG> i Madhya Pradesh ruling was not examined detail particularly as it was said to be pending in appeal before the Supreme <ORG> According to the Statement of Objects and Reasons accompanying the bill the primary objective of the legislation is to condense and simplify the existing law on the subject by consolidating the different enactments customs and usages relating to the levy of cess in the State to cure defects and deficiencies therein and to introduce uniformity in the levy of cess throughout the State A amendment makes it clear that lands held for carrying on mining operations ar not exempt from the cess The cess shall be assessed on the annual value of all lands on whatever tenure held calculated in the manner hereinafter appearing Sub section was amended by Act of by substituting of in place of but a amendment inserted A to provide that for a period to the cess would be levied at of the annual value in respect of lands held for carrying on mining operations a in case of lands held for carrying on mining operations in relation to any mineral on such percentum of the annual value of the said lands as specified against that mineral in Schedule II and in case of other lands fifty percentum of the annual value Clause a was again amended by Act of to read thus a in the case of land held for carrying on mining operations in relation to any mineral such percentum of the annual value as the State Government may by notification specify from time to time in relation to such mineral It will thus be seen that in place of a fixed rate an elasticity was provided for initially by requiring the rates to be specified in the Schedule differently for different minerals In so far as is material for our present purposes it directs that the cess is payable by a person for the lands he holds for carrying on mining operations and shall be paid by him to the <ORG> This clause was inserted in simultaneously with the amendment of by Act of Annual Value The annual value of lands held by a raiyat shall be the rent payable by such raiyat to the land lord immediately under whom he holds the land In the case of lands held as an estate the annual value shall be the aggregate of a the amount which the intermediary is entitled to receive on account of revenue or rent less the amount payable by such intermediary as revenue to the intermediary immediately superior to him or to the Government as the case may be and the rent if any payable held for carrying on mining operations the annual value shall be the royalty or as the case may be the dead rent payable by the person carrying or mining operations to the <ORG> It also states the royalty would include any payments made or likely to be make to the <ORG> for the right of raising minerals from the land which shall be calculated on every tone of such minerals despatched from the land at the same rate as prescribed under the said Act or such other rate as may be fixed by the <ORG> but not exceeding the amount which would have been otherwise payable as royalty under the said Act Act of also amended to red thus In the case of lands held for carrying on mining operations the annual value shall be the royalty or as the case may be the dead rent payable by the person carrying on mining operations to the <ORG> or the pit mouth value wherever it has determined Sections to provide for the assessment of the cess in respect of various cases inserted by the amendment provided Assessment of cess on lands held for mining operations The cess payable in respect of lands held for carrying on mining operations shall be assessed in the prescribed manner Nothing contained in Sections and A shall apply in relation to the assessment of cess in respect of the aforesaid lands The prescribed manner of such assessment had been already set out in the Orissa Cess Rules Rule A inserted in deals with this but it is unnecessary for us to consider the details except to mention that it is assessed and collected along with the amount of royalty or dead rent by the Mining Officer concerned Application of proceeds of the cess Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law the amount collected as cess shall be credited to the Consolidated Fund of the State and shall be utilised in the following manner namely a amounts collected in respect of lands within the local limits of any Municipality or Notified Area constituted under the Orissa Municipal Act shall be paid to the concerned <ORG> or <ORG> as the case may be and amounts other than those referred to in clause a shall be distributed in the prescribed manner among the Grama Panchayats Samitis and Parishads in the ratio of twelve is to eight is to five Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law the amount collected as cess shall be credited to <ORG> and shell be utilised for the following purposes namely a primary education contribution to Grama Panchayats and contribution to <ORG> Explanation In this section Grama Panchayat means Grama Panchayat constituted under the Orissa Panchayat Samitis Act The proportion in which the amount collected as cess is to be allotted for the said purpose shall be as may be prescribed Application of proceeds of the cess Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law all amounts collected as cess shall be credited fifty percentum of those which represent cess collected in respect of lands other than lands held by carrying on mining operations shall be utilised for the following purposes namely a primary education contribution to Grama Panchayats and contribution to <ORG> The allotment of amounts to be utilised for the pur poses mentioned in clause a and of sub section shall be made in such proportion as may be prescribed BIHAR We shall now turn to the relevant provisions of the Bihar Act The definition as amended by the latter reads as follows royalty for the purpose of this Act in respect of mines and quarries means payment which includes dead rent made or likely to be made to the owner of mines and minerals for the right of working the same on the quantity or value of such produce by a lessee if the land had been under a lease granted under MMRD Act and rules made thereunder and includes any amount which <ORG> may demand from the appropriation of mines and minerals belonging to the <ORG> and any amount that may be paid as or in lieu of royalty for the right of working mines and quarries in areas held or acquired under any Act or agreement At the end of the section it added the following interpretation clause Valuation of mineral bearing land means with reference to assessment of local cess in any year on land held for working mines and quarries the value at pit mouth of all the mineral extracted form the land in that year and the Explanation which defines the value at pit mouth of a mineral ii provided that from and after the commencement of this Act in any district or part of a district all immovable property situate therein except otherwise in Section provided shall be liable to the payment of a local cess Cess has to be assessed The local cess shall be assessed on the annual value of lands and until provision to the contrary is made by the <ORG> on the royalty of mines and quarries sale value of the other immovable properties including forest produce and annual net profits from tramways and railways as contained respectively as prescribed in this Act and the rate at which the local cess shall be levied for each other shall be a in the case of royalty the rate will be determined by the government from time to time but it will not exceed the amount of royalty in the case such annual net profits fifteen paise on each rupee of such profits in the case of annual value of lands twenty paise per rupee of the annual value and in the case of sale value of immovable properties including first produce the rate will not exceed and the State Government may by notification prescribe from time to time the commodities on the sale of which cess would be levied along with the rate at which it would be levied Cess how to be assessed The local cess shall be assessed on the annual value of the lands and until provision to the contrary is made by the <ORG> on the royalty of mines and quarries or on value of mineral bearing land as the case may be sale value of other immovable properties including forest produce and annual net profits from tramways and railways ascertained respectively as prescribed in the Act and the rate at which the local cess shall be levied for each year shall be a in the case of royalty the rate will be determined by the Government from time to time but it will not exceed five times the amount of royalty provided that the local cess payable in any one year shall not be less than the amount arrived at by multiplying the dead rent with the rate of cess determined undo clause a aa in the case of value of mineral bearing land where the local cess payable in any year in respect of any mineral bearing land as assessed in clause a is less than per cent of the value of mineral bearing land in that year then notwithstanding anything hereinbefore contained <ORG> may assess the local cess at such percentage of the value of the mineral bearing land not exceeding of per cent as may be notified in the Official Gazette from time to time although the cess so assessed may exceed five times the amounts of royalty in the case of annual net profit fifteen paise on each rupee of such profits in the case of annual value of land twenty five paise per rupee of the annual value and in the case of sale value of immovable properties including first produce the rate will not exceed per cent and the State Government may be notification prescribe from time to time the commodities on the sale of which cess would be levied along with the rates at which it would be levied It has been amended from time to time inter alia in and In exercise of the powers conferred by above <ORG> issued a notification on determining the rate of cess on the amount of royalty of all minerals of the <ORG> at Our attention has also been drawn to and some print made of a notification dated by which <ORG> modifying the earlier notification of determined the rate of cess on the amount of royalty of iron ore which is extracted from manually operated iron ore mines at which was followed up by a notification dated enhancing the rate at on the amount of royalty of iron ore in respect of mines other than those in which the ore is extracted manually It provides for the levy of an energy development cess Part I an urban development cess Part II a cess on transfer of vacant land Part III and a cess on storage of coal Part IV and that the amounts to the credit of the funds as well as the cesses collected under Parts II and III should be utilised for special purposes connected respectively with energy development Act of changed Part IV into a part dealing with cess on land held in connection with mineral rights with full retrospective effect Part IV as now substituted deals only with land situate in the State and held under a mining lease for undertaking mining operations in relation to major mineral including operations for raising winning or extracting coal Section and read thus Section There shall be levied and collected a cess on land held in connection with mineral rights at such rate as may be notified by <ORG> per ton of major mineral raised and the rate of cess prevailing in respect of coal during the period commencing from the date of commencement of the Principal Act and ending on the date of commencement of the Madhya Pradesh Upkar Sanshodhan Adhiniyam shall be deemed to be the rate of cess notified under this sub section in respect of coal Provided the subject to the limitation mentioned above <ORG> may by notification increase or reduce the rate of cess at an interval of not less than one year where the rate is increased it shall not be in excess of fifty per cent of the rate for the time being in force Provided further that every notification under the above proviso shall be laid on the table of <ORG> and the provisions of Section A of the Madhya Pradesh General Clauses Act No The rate of cess to be notified for the first time in exercise of the powers conferred by Sub section shall be effective from the first of April The cess levied under sub section shall subject to and in accordance with the rules made in this behalf be assessed and collected by such agencies and in such manner as may be prescribed The agencies prescribed under sub section shall for the purpose of assessment collection and recovery of cess and all matters connected therewith exercise such of the powers conferred upon the authorities specified in section of the Madhya Pradesh General Sales Tax Act No of for the purpose aforesaid in respect of sales tax under said Act and the rules made thereunder as may be prescribed as if such agencies were the authorities specified in the section and the cess on land held in connection with mineral rights were the tax levied under the said Act Section The proceeds of the cess on land held in connection with the mineral rights may be utilised by <ORG> for the general development of the mineral bearing areas Section has however been omitted by an Amending Act of again with full retrospective effect i from It appears however that there was in force in Madhya Pradesh another statute levying mineral development cess Section imposes forest development cess on every sale or supply for forest produce by <ORG> There shall be levied and collected on the land held under a mining lease for undertaking mining operation a mineral areas development cess at the rate of twenty five percent of the rental value thereof The mineral areas development cess shall subject to and in accordance with the rules made in this behalf be collected by such agencies and in such manner as may be prescribed and shall be applied towards development of mineral bearing areas The amendment substituted the following sub section in Section There shall be levied and collected on the land held under a mining lease for undertaking minor operations for a major mineral a mineral areas development cess at the rate of one hundred percentum the rental value thereof The amendment substituted the following sub section in place of the above There shall be levied and collected a on the land held under mining lease for undertaking mining operations for a major mineral other than coal a mineral areas development cess at the rate of one hundred percentum of the rental value thereof on the land held under mining lease for undertaking mining operations for coal a mineral area development cess at the rate of the hundred twenty five percentum of the rental value thereof Rule provided for the collection of the cess every month along with the royalty or dividend Application of cess The State Government shall decide from time to time the manner in which the amount collected from cess shall be utilized for the development of mining lease areas which defines annual value provides for different measures for determining the annual value in respect of lands held under different kinds of tenures and in the case of lands held for mining operations the measure of such annual value is the royalty or dead rent paid to the <ORG> This argument <NAME> contended is based on the statutory language used in the Orissa Cess Act and should prevail independently of the correctness or otherwise of <NAME> Secondly he submitted that royalty is not a tax and the cess on royalty is also not a tax but only a fee Being a fee <ORG> competence to impose it has to be determined with reference to Entry read with Entry of the State List Basically it will seen two questions arise Can the cess be considered as land revenue under Entry or as a tax on land under Entry or as a tax on mineral rights under Entry of the State List If the answer to question is in the negative can the cess be considered to be a fee pertaining to the field covered by Entry of the State List or has the State been denuded of the legislative competence under this Entry because of <ORG> having enacted the MMRD Act Taking up the first question the attempt to bring the levy under Entry of the State List proceeds in two steps At least in <ORG> the statute sought to include royalty within the meaning of land revenue but there is no such provision in the Orissa Act and this being so royalty or the tax thereon cannot be equated to land revenue The learned Judge held that the tax in the case before him was not a tax on mineral rights because it was levied on the value of the minerals extracted If his observations in this context are read as a whole it would seem that he also was of opinion that a tax on royalty would be a tax on mineral rights for he observed at pp The next contention on behalf of the State of Orissa is that if the cess is not justified as a fee it is a tax under item of List II of the Seventy Schedule Item provides for taxes on mineral rights subject to any limitations imposed by <ORG> by law relating to mineral development This raises a question as to what are taxes on mineral rights Obviously taxes on mineral rights must be different from taxes on goods produced in the nature of duties of excise If taxes on mineral rights also include taxes on minerals produced there would be no difference between taxes on mineral rights and duties of excise under item of List I A comparison of List I and II of the Seventh Schedule shows that the same tax is not put in both the Lists The difference can be understood if one sees that before minerals are extracted and become liable to duties of excise somebody has got to work the mines The usual method of working them is for the owner of the mine to grant mining leases to those who have got the capital to work the mines There should therefore be no difficulty in holding that taxes on mineral rights are taxes on the right to extract minerals and not taxes on the minerals actually extracted Thus tax on mineral rights would be confined for example to taxes on leases of mineral rights and on premium or royalty for that It is said that there may be cases where the owner himself extracts minerals and does not give any right of extraction to somebody else and that in such cases in the absence of mining leases or sub leases there would be no way of leaving tax on mineral rights Where there is a lease of the building the annual value is determined by the lease money but there are many cases where owners themselves live in buildings In such cases also taxes on buildings are levied on the annual value worked out according to certain rules There would be no difficulty where an owner himself works the mine to value the mineral rights on the same principles on which leases of mineral rights are made and then to tax the royalty which for example the owner might have got if instead of working the mine himself he had leased it out to somebody else Therefore the present cess is not a tax on mineral rights it is a tax on the minerals actually produced and can be no different in pith and substance from a tax on goods produced which comes under Item of List I as duty of excise The present levy therefore under of the Act cannot be justified as a tax on mineral rights It purported to levy a cess on land revenue and royalty was brought within the definition of that expression It was therefore a case where they levy had no reference to land at all but only to the income from the land in the case of <ORG> lands got by way of land revenue or otherwise It is argued that the tax here is therefore a tax on land and it is immaterial that this tax is quantified with reference to the income yielded by the land One realistic measure of such capital or annual value will be the income that the land will yield just as for property tax purposes the annual value is based on the amount for which the property can reasonably let from year to year The Court indicated the following approach to the issue before it The first question which falls for consideration therefore is whether the impost in the present case is a tax on land within the meaning of Entry of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution It is well settled that the entries in the three legislative lists have to be interpreted interpreted in their widest amplitude and therefore if a tax can reasonably be held to be a tax on land it will come within Entry it follows therefore that the use to which the land is put can be taken into account in imposing a tax on it within the meaning of entry of List II for the annual value of land which can certainly be taken into account in imposing a tax for the purpose of this entry would necessarily depend upon the use to which the land it put It is in the light of this settled proposition that we have to examine the scheme of of the Act which imposes a tax under challenge On the other hand it is contended for the respondents that whatever may have been the original intention the true and real impact of the cess is only on the royalties It is said that at any rate after the amendments of when lands held for mining operations were segregated for levy of separate and steep rates of cess based on royalty the ostensible appearance of levying a tax on all land with reference to annual value has disappeared and a direct undisguised tax on royalties from mining lands has taken its place it is urged that for deciding whether the tax is really a tax on land as in <NAME> or whether it is really a tax on royalties which has been struck down in <ORG> it is not the form or the statutory machinery that matters one has to look at the real substance and true impact of the levy With effect from clause a above was amended and clause aa inserted to provide for the levy of cess a in respect of land other than a tea estate at the rate of six paise on each rupee of development value thereof aa in respect of a tea estate at such rate not exceeding rupees six on each kilogram of tea on the dispatches from such tea estate of tea grown therein as the State Government may by notification in the Official Gazette fix in this behalf Provided that in calculating the dispatches of tea for the purpose of levy of rural employment cess such dispatches for sale made at such tea auction centres as may be recognised by the State Government by notification in the Official Gazette shall be excluded Provided further that <ORG> may fix different rates on dispatches of different kinds of tea Sub section was added in Section to enable <ORG> if it considers necessary so to do by notification in <ORG> to exempt such categories of dispatches or such percentage of despatches from liability to pay the whole or any part of the rural employment cess or reduce the rate of rural employment cess payable thereon under clause aa of sub section on such terms and conditions as may be specified in the notification Upholding these contentions the <ORG> observed The question then is whether the impugned levy impedes the free flow of trade and commerce throughout the territory of India and if it does whether it falls within the exception carved out in article If the levy imposes a cess in respect of tea estate it may will be said that even though the free flow of trade is impeded in its Government throughout the territory of India it is in consequence of an indirect or remote effect of the levy and that it cannot be said that article is contravened If that contention is sound there can be no doubt that it constitutes a violation of article unless the legislation is brought within the scope of article To determine whether the levy is in respect of tea estates or is a levy on despatches of tea the substance of the legislation must be ascertained from the relevant provisions of the statute It cannot be disputed that the subject of the levy the nature of which defines the quality of the levy must not be confused with the measure of liability that is to say the quantum of the tax But what is the position here Now for determining the true nature of the legislation whether it is a legislation in respect of tea estate and therefore of land or in respect of despatches of tea we must as we have said take all relevant provisions into account and ascertain the essential substance of it It seems to us that although the impugned provisions speak of a levy of cess in respect of tea estates what is contemplated is a levy on despatches of tea instead The entire structure of the levy points to that conclusion If the levy is regarded as one in respect of tea estates and the measure of the liability is defined in terms of the weight of tea dispatched there must be a nexus between the two indicating relationship between the levy on the tea estate and the criteria for determining the measure of liability If there is no nexus at all it can conceivably be inferred that the levy is not what it purports to be The statutory provisions for measuring the liability on account of the levy throws light on the general character of the tax as observed by <ORG> in Re A Reference under the Government of Ireland Act and Section of the Finance Act Northern Ireland A III All these cases were referred to in <ORG> where in the discussion on this point at page this Court said Any standard which maintains a nexus with the essential character of the levy can be regarded as a valid basis for assessing the measure of the levy Applying the above tests to the case before it the Court reached the conclusion that in substance the impugned levy was a levy in respect of despatches of tea and not in respect of tea estates It was then pointed out that the question of legislative competence also turned on this issue If this impugned legislation were to be regarded as a levy in respect of the estates it would be referable to entry in List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution which speaks taxes on lands and buildings But if the legislation is in substance legislation in respect of despatches of tea legislative authority must be found for it with reference to some other entry Pointing out that no such entry in List II or III had been brought its notice and further that under of the Tea Ct control over the tea industry has been assumed by <ORG> within the meaning of Entry of List I the Court upheld the challenge to the competence of the State legislature to levy the impugned cess There is force in the contention urged by Sri <NAME> Iyer that there is a difference in principle between a tax on royalties derived from land and a tax on land measured by reference to the income derived therefrom But here the levy is not measured by the income derived by the assessee from the land as is the case with lands other than mineral lands <ORG> draws a clear distinction between tax on land and tax on income arising from land He also submitted that the statue under consideration in <ORG> did not provide for any cess in the case of land which did not yield any royalty in other words the Act did not use dead rent as a basis on which land was to be valued He drew attention to the observations of <NAME> In para of <ORG> that if the Explanation to had used the words surface rent in place of royalty the position would have been different and that if a cess on such surface rent or dead rent is charged it could be justified as a tax on land falling within the purview of Entry Here however the position is different and so he urged the nature of the levy is also different We may have considered these points as furnishing some ground to distinguish the present levy from that in india <ORG> but for the <ORG> specific disapproval of <NAME> As to the second contention based on the observations in the judgment of <NAME> we may point out here the levy is not one confined to dead rent or surface rent as suggested by <NAME> but one on royalty which even according to <NAME> cannot be described as a tax on land and measuring the cess by reference to the income of other categories of land are valid there is no reason why alone should be treated differently and objected to as imposing a tax on royalties particularly when the levy also extends to dead rent There is no doubt an apparent anomaly in considering and as levying a tax on land but construing as imposing a tax on royalties and this anomaly has been noticed in <ORG> vide para But the question is what is it that is really being taxed by the <ORG> So far as mineral bearing lands are concerned is the impact of the tax on the land or on royalties The change in the scheme of taxation under in the importance and magnitude of the revenue by way of royalties received by the <ORG> the charge of the cess as a percentage and indeed as multiples of the amount of royalty and the mode and collection of the cess amount along with the royalties and as part thereof are circumstances which go to show that the legislation in this regard is with respect to royalty rather than with respect to land <NAME> had invited our attention to the decision of this <ORG> in <ORG> Zila Parishad which upheld the validity of a circumstances and property tax levied by a Zila Parishad It held that the tax was a composite one referable to Entry tax on lands and buildings Entry taxes on animals and boats and Entry tax as on professions trades callings and employments of List II The fact that one of the components of the impugned tax namely the component of circumstances is referable to other entries in addition to Entry shall not be construed as conferring an unlimited charter on the local authorities to impose disproportionately excessive levies on the assessees who are subject to their jurisdiction An excessive levy on circumstances will tend to blue the distinction between a tax on income and a tax on circumstances income will then cease to be a mere measure or yardstick of the tax and will become the very subject matter of the tax For the reasons discussed above we repel the contention of the <ORG> seeking to justify the levy under Entry and of List II of the Seventh Schedule Counsel for the assessees respondents invite attention to the opening sentence of para which runs In the aforesaid view of the matter we are of the opinion that royalty is a tax and argue that this clinches the issue He points out that though there is a reference in para to the conclusion of <NAME> in a judgement of <ORG> that royalty under of the MMRD Act is really a tax and a reference in para to the Rajasthan Punjab Gujarat and Orissa decisions to the effect that royalty is not a tax there is no discussion criticism or approval of any of the decision on this point and that therefore the first sentence of para relied upon for the respondents is non sequitir He submits that perhaps there is a typographical error in the first sentence of para and that the sentence should really read thus In the aforesaid view of the matter we are of opinion that cess is a tax and as such a cess on royalty being a tax on royalty is beyond the competence of <ORG> He submits that before we express any opinion on this issue we should consider the matter afresh and places before us extracts from various lexicons and dictionaries to show that a royalty is nothing more than the rent or lease amount paid to a lessor in consideration for the grant of a lease to exploit minerals We do not think that it is necessary for us to express an opinion either way on this controversy for it seems to us it is immaterial for the purposes of the present case the question whether royalty is a tax or not does not assist us much in furnishing an answer to the two questions posed in the present case and set out earlier We shall therefore leave this question to rest here This takes us to the second question posed by us initially and this turns on the effect of Act and the declaration contained in thereof which has been extracted earlier This will arise if we treat the levy as a tax falling under Entry of List II or alternatively as a fee though it may not affect the State competence if it can be attributed to Entry of List II To take up Entry first a perusal of entry world show that the competence of <ORG> with respect thereto is circumscribed by any limitations imposed by <ORG> by law relating to mineral development The Act is there can be no doubt about this a law of <ORG> relating to mineral development Sub section of Section in terms states that the royalties payable under the Second Schedule to the Act shall not be enhanced more than once during a period of three years <ORG> has held that this is a clear bar on the State legislature taxing royalty so as in effect to amend the Second Schedule to the Central Act and that if the cess is taken as a tax falling under Entry it will be ultra vires in view of the provisions of the Central Act There is one great difficulty in accepting this solution to the <ORG> problem as it stands now earmarks the purposes of utilisation of only fifty percent of the proceeds of the cess and that too is limited to the cess collected in respect of lands other than lands held for carrying on mining operations In other words the levy cannot be correlated to any services rendered or to be rendered by the <ORG> to the class of persons from whom the levy is collected This consideration apart even assuming it is a fee the <ORG> legislature can impose a fee only in respect of any of the matters in the <ORG> List Under Entry of List I regulation of mines and mineral development is in the field of <ORG> legislation to the extent to which such regulation and development under the control of the <ORG> is declared by <ORG> by law to be expedient in the public interest It therefore follow that any <ORG> legislation to the extent it encroaches on the field covered by the Act will be ultra vires It would appear prima facie that the contention has to be upheld on the basis of the trilogy of decisions referred to at the outset viz to which reference will also be made later merely on the ground that it has some effect on such industry Before considering the above contention it will be useful to refer to certain earlier decisions of this Court which have a bearing on this issue While upholding the general right of <ORG> to legislate for the acquisition of even property vested in a <ORG> the Court pointed out that this could be done only if there is some provision in the Central Act expressly or necessarily implying that the property of the <ORG> is to be acquired by the <ORG> However the Court held when the requisite declaration under Entry is made the power to legislate for regulation and development of mines and minerals under the control of the <ORG> would by necessary implication include the power to acquire mines and minerals By section of the Act all the rights of former landlords or lessors under mining leases granted by them in their estates came to be vested in the <ORG> but the terms and conditions of those leases were made binding upon the <ORG> Government The Court applying <NAME> and <NAME> held that the whose whole of the legislative field in respect of minor minerals was covered by <ORG> legislation and Entry of List II was to the extent cut down by Entry of List I The old leases could not be modified except by a legislative enactment by <ORG> on the lines of of the Act In a writ petition filed by one of the owners <ORG> held unless the mineral deposits were specifically mentioned in the wajib ul arz of the village as having vested in the <ORG> their ownership would continue to remain vested in the former proprietors according to the record of rights To meet this difficulty and the difficulties that had been created by haphazard leases created by the erstwhile proprietors the <ORG> legislature passed the Haryana Minerals Vesting of Rights Act and issued notifications thereunder again acquiring the rights to the saltpetre in the lands putting up certain saltpetre bearing lands to auction <ORG> upheld the challenge to the validity of the notifications holding that in view of the declaration contained in of the Act the field covered by the impugned Act was already fully occupied by Central legislation and that therefore the <ORG> Act was void and imperative on grounds of repugnancy This Court however reversed <ORG> decision It held that though the stated objects and reasons of the <ORG> Act showed that the acquisition was to be made to protect the mineral potentialities of the land and to ensure their proper development and exploitation on scientific lines and this did not materially differ from that which could be said to lie behind the Central Act the character of the <ORG> Act had to be judged by the substance and effect of its provisions and not merely by the purpose given in the <ORG>ment of Objects and Reasons In particular of the Central Act showed that <ORG> itself contemplated <ORG> legislation for vesting of lands containing minerals deposits in the <ORG> Government a feature that could be explained only on the assumption that <ORG> did not intend to touch upon the power of <ORG> legislatures under Entry of List II read with Entry of List III also showed that there was no intention to interfere with vesting of lands in the <ORG>s by the provisions of the Central Act Moreover power to acquire for purposes of development and regulation has not been exercised by Act of The existence of power of <ORG> to legislate on this topic as an incident of exercise of legislative power on another subject is one thing It is difficult to see how the field of acquisition could become occupied by a Central Act in the same way as it had been in the West Bengal case supra even before <ORG> legislate to acquire land ina <ORG> At least untill <ORG> has so legislated as it was shown to have done by the statute considered by this Court in the case from West Bengal the field is free for <ORG> legislation falling under the express provisions of entry of List III Answering this question in the affirmative the <ORG> observed The argument that the <ORG> legislature lacked competence to enact the impugned legislation is without force Legislative power of the <ORG> under Entry List II is eroded only to the extent control is assumed by the <ORG> pursuant to a declaration made by the <ORG> in respect of a declared industry as spelt out by the legislative enactment and the field occupied by such enactment is measure of erosion Subject to such erosion on the remainder the <ORG> legislature will have power to legislate in respect of a declared industry without in any way trenching upon the occupied field <ORG> legislature which is otherwise competent to deal with industry under Entry List II can deal with that industry in exercise of other powers enabling it to legislate under different heads set out in Lists II and III and this power cannot be denied to the <ORG> The contention that the impugned Act is in violation of section of the Central Act had no merit If an attempt was made to take over the manage ment or control of any industrial undertaking in a declared industry the bar of section would inhibit exercise of such executive power The inhibition of section is on the executive power which if as a sequel to an acquisition of an industrial undertaking the management or control of the industrial undertaking stands transferred to the acquiring authority section is not attracted It does not preclude or forbid a State legislature exercising legislative power under an entry other than Entry of List II and if in exercise of that legislative power the consequential transfer of management or control over the industry or undertaking follows as an incident of acquisition such taking over of management or control pursuant to an exercise of legislative power is not within the inhibition of section Here the question was whether the enactment of the Coal Mines Nationalisation Act and the Act precluded the State legislature from providing for the levy of a property tax by <ORG> constituted under a Act of the State legislature in respect of lands and buildings used for the purposes of and covered by coal mines The plea on behalf of the appellant coalfields was that the State Act was invalid a as it encroached on the field vested in the <ORG> by reason of the declaration of of Act and as it impeded the powers and functions of the union under the Coal Mines Nationalosation Act which had been enacted by <ORG> for acquisition of coal mines with a view to reorganising and restructuring such coal mines so to ensure the rational coordinated and scientific development and utilisation of coal resources as best to subserve the common good Rejecting this contention the Court held Apart from the fact that there is no data before us showing that the property tax constitutes an impediment in the achievement of the goals of the Coal Mines Nationalisation Act the provisions of the Act of under which <ORG> are constituted afford an effective answer to the Attorney General contention Entry of List II relates to Regulation of mines and mineral development subject to the provisions of List I with respect to regulation and development under the control of the <ORG> Entry of List I relates to Regulation of mines and mineral development to the extent to which such regulation and development under control of the <ORG> is declared by <ORG> by law to be expedient in the public interest the legislative field covered by Entry of List II will pass on to <ORG> by virtue of Entry List I But in order to judge whether on that account the State legislature loses its competence to pass the Act of it is necessary to have regard to the object and purpose of that Act and to the relevant provisions thereof under which <ORG> development Authorities are given the power to tax lands and buildings within their jurisdiction We have set out the objects of the Act at the commencement of this judgement one of which is to provide for the development and administration of <ORG>s through <ORG> Development Authorities Section of the Act of which provides for the constitution of the special areas lays down by sub section that Notwithstanding anything contained in the Madhya Pradesh Municipal Corporation Act the Madhya Pradesh <ORG>s Act <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> or a <ORG> as the case may be shall in relation to the special area and as from the date of the <ORG> Development Authority undertakes the function under clause of clause vi of Section ceases to exercise the powers and perform the function and duties which the <ORG> Development Authority is competent to exercise and perform under the Act of Section defines the function of the <ORG> Development Authority one of which as prescribed by clause is to provide the municipal services as specified in sections and of the Madhya Pradesh Municipalities Act Section which defines the powers of the authority shows that those powers are conferred inter alia for the purpose of municipal adminstration Surely the functions powers and duties of Municipalities do not become an occupied filed by reason of the declaration contained in section of the mines and Minerals Development Regulation Act Though therefore on account of that declaration the legislative field covered by Entry List II may pass on to the <ORG> by virtue of Entry List I the competence of <ORG> to enact laws for municipal adminstration will remain unaffected by our declaration Entry of List II related to Local Government that is to say the constitution and powers of municipal corporation and other local authorities for the purpose of local self Government The power to impose tax on lands and buildings is derived by <ORG> from Entry of List II Taxes on lands and buildings The power of the municipalities to levy tax on lands and buildings has been conferred by <ORG> on <ORG> Those authorities have the power to levy that tax in order effectively to discharge the municipal functions which are passed on them Entry of List I does not contemplate the taking over of municipal functions It was found that <ORG> had become the local authority to discharge the functions of a municipal adminstration under a State Act and that the regulation of construction activities was one of the aspects of municipal adminstration and management In this situation the question posed was answered in the negative following <NAME> <ORG> and <NAME> that the entire matter requires careful consideration On the other hand learned counsel for the respondents submitted that the authority of <ORG> in Western Coalfields which endorsed <NAME> should be considered weak after <ORG> which has overruled <NAME> As pointed out in Ishwari Khetan the mere declaration of a law of <ORG> that it is expedient for an industry of the regulation and development of mines and minerals to be under the control of the <ORG> under Entry or entry does not denude the State legislatures of their legislative powers with respect to the fields covered by the several entries in List II or List III Particularly in the case of a declaration under Entry <ORG> is extended to the extent control is assumed by the <ORG> pursuant to such declaration as spelt out by the legislative enactment which makes the declaration While concerning itself generally with the requirements regarding grants of licenses and leases for prospecting and exploitation of minerals it contains certain provisions which are of direct relevance to the issue before us A enacts a like provision in respect of dead rent Reference may also be made to and which to the extent relevant are extracted here Power of <ORG> to make rules in respect of minerals <ORG> may by notification in the Official Gazette make rules for regulating the grant of prospecting licenses and mining leases in respect of minerals and for purposes connected therewith In particular and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing power such rules may provide for all or any of the following matters namely i the fixing and collection of fees for prospecting licenses or mining leases surface rent security deposit fines other fees or charges and the time within which and the manner in which the dead rent or royalty shall be payable XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX the construction maintenance and use of roads power transmission lines tramways railways aerial rope ways pipe lines and the making of passages for water for mining purposes on any land comprised in the mining lease XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX qq The manner in which rehabilitation of flora and other vegetation such as trees and the like destroyed by reason of any prospecting a mining operation shall be made in the Substituted by Act of for the original clause i which read i the fixing and collection of dead rent fines fees or other charges and their collection of royalties in respect of i prospecting licenses ii mining leases iii minerals mines quarried excavated or collected same area or in any other area selected by <ORG> whether by way of reimbursement of the cost of rehabilitation or otherwise by the person holding the prospecting license or mining lease which originally laid a duty on <ORG> to take all such steps as may be necessary for the conservation and development of minerals in India has been amended by Act of to cover steps for the conservation and systematic development of minerals in India and for the protection of environment by preventing or controlling any pollution which may be caused by prospecting or mining operations and the scope of the rule making power under has likewise been enlarged read thus Any rent royalty tax fee or other sum due to the Government under this Act or the rules made thereunder or under the terms and conditions of any prospecting licence or mining lease may on a certificate of such effect as may be specified by <ORG> in this behalf by general or special order be recovered in the same manner as an arrear of land revenue If one looks at the above provisions and bears in mind that in assessing the field covered by the Act of Parliament in question one should be guided as laid down in Hingir Rampur and <NAME> not merely by the actual provisions of the Central Act or the rules made thereunder but should also take into account matters and aspects which can legitimately be brought within the scope of the said statute the conclusion seems irresistible particularly in view of Hingir Rampur and <NAME> that the State Act has trespassed into the field covered by the Central Act The present legislation traceable to the legislative power under Entry or Entry of the State List which stands impaired by the <ORG> declaration under Entry can hardly be equated to the law for land acquisition or municipal administration which were considered in the cases cited and which are traceable to different specific entries in List II or List III Newly inserted by Act of <NAME> contended that the object and purposes of the Orissa Act and its provisions were quite distinct and different from the object and purposes of the Central Act with the result that the two enactments could validly coexist since they do not cover the same field As pointed out by Sri <NAME> there is a difference between the object of the ACt and its subject Even this was amended in whereafter there has been no restriction regarding the cess collected in respect of mining areas which form part of the consolidated fund of the State <ORG> first set out the scheme of the impugned Act thus The scheme of this Act thus clearly shows that it has been passed for the purpose of development of mining areas in the <ORG> The basis for the operation of the Act is the constitution of a mining area and it is in regard to mining areas thus constituted that the provision of the Act come into play Orissa is an under developed <ORG> in the Union of India though it has a lot of mineral wealth of great potential value Unfortunately its mineral wealth is located generally in areas sparsely populated with bad communication Inevitably the exploitation of the minerals is handicapped by lack of communications and the difficulty experienced in keeping the labour force sufficiently healthy and in congenial surroundings The mineral development of the <ORG> thereof requires that provision should be made for improving the communications by constructing good roads and by providing means of transport such as tramways supply of water and electricity would also help It would also be necessary to provide for amenities of sanitation and education to the labour force in order to attract workmen to the area Before the Act wa passed it appears that the mine owners tried to put up small length roads and tramways for their own individual purpose but that obviously could not be as effective as roads constructed by the <ORG> and tramway service provided by it It is on a consideration of these facts that <ORG> decided to take an active part in a systematic development of its mineral areas which would held the mine owners in moving their minerals quickly through the shortest route and would attract labour to assist the excavation of the minerals Thus there can be no doubt that the primary and the principal object of the Act is to develop the mineral areas in the <ORG> and to assist more efficient and extended exploitation of its mineral wealth It is true that no rules have in fact been framed by <ORG> in regard to the levy and collection of any fees but in our opinion that would not make any difference If it is held that this Act contains the declaration referred to in Entry there would be no difficulty in holding that the declaration covers the field of conservation and development of minerals and the said field is indistinguishable from the field covered by the impugned Act What Entry provides is that the legislative competence of <ORG> is subject to the provisions of List with respect of regulation and development under the control of the <ORG> the Entry in List requires a declaration by <ORG> by law that regulation and development of mines should be under the control of the <ORG> in public interest Therefore if a Central Act has been passed for the purpose of providing for the conservation and development of minerals and if it contains the requisite declaration then it would not be competent to <ORG> to pass an Act in respect of the subject matter covered by the said declaration In order that the declaration should be effective it is not necessary that rules should be made or enforced all that this required is a declaration by <ORG> that it is expedient in the public interest to take the regulation and development of mines under the control of the <ORG> In such a case the test must be whether the legislative declaration covers the field or not The following observations in Tulloch are also apposite in this context On the other hand Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the respondent urged that the Central ACt covered the entire field of mineral development that being the extent to which <ORG> had declared by law and it was expedient that the <ORG> should assume control In this connection he relied most strongly on the terms of which laid a duty upon <ORG> to take all such steps as may be necessary for the conservation and development of minerals in India and for that propose <ORG> may by notification make such rules as it deems fit If the entire field of mineral development was taken over that would include the provision of amenities to workmen employed in the mines which was necessary in order to stimulate or maintain the working of mines The test which he suggested was whether if under the power conferred by of the Central Act <ORG> has made rules providing for the amenities for which provision was made by the Orissa Act and if <ORG> had imposed a fee to defray the expenses of the provision of these amenities would such rules be held to be ultra vires of <ORG> and this particularly when taken in conjunction with the matters for which rules could be made under to which reference has already been made We consider there is considerable force in this submission of learned counsel for the respondent and thus would require very detailed and careful scrutiny The question whether the State of Bihar had the authority to grant a lease for lifting coal slurry coming out of the appellants washeries and getting deposited on the river bed or other lands was answered in the negative the court came to the conclusion that the slurry was a mineral and that its regulation was within the exclusive jurisdiction of <ORG> The <ORG> in coming to the conclusion held that no rules had been framed under or disposal or discharge of waste slime or tailing arising from any mining or metallurgical operations carried out but held that this was immaterial in view of the principles laid down in Hingir Rampur Tulloch and Baijnath Kedia We have therefore come to the conclusion that the validity of the impugned Act cannot be upheld by reference to Entry or Entry of List II <NAME> argued that the topic of legislation concerns land and therefore falls under entry of the State List and he drew our attention to other provisions on the subject of mines in the Land Reforms Act as originally passed The abolition of the rights of intermediaries to the mines and vesting these rights as lessors in <ORG> was a topic connected with land and land tenures But after the mining leases stood between <ORG> and the lessees any attempt to regulate those mining leases will fall not in entry but in entry even though the regulation incidentally touches land The pith and substance of the amendment to of the Reforms Act falls within entry although it incidentally touches land and not vice versa There are no clear indications in the stature that the amounts are collected by way of fee and not tax <NAME> submits that in the original counter affidavit filed on behalf of the <ORG> no case was sought to be made out that it was a tax on land the case was that it was a tax on mineral rights Article is in these terms Any taxes duties cesses or fees which immediately before the commencement of this Constitution were being lawfully levied by the Government of any <ORG> or by an municipality or other authority or body for the purposes of the <ORG> municipality district or other local area may notwithstanding that those taxes duties cesses or fees are mentioned in the Union List continue to be levied and to be applied to the same purposes until provision to the contrary is made by <ORG> by law It has also been brought to our notice that a Bench of two Judges of this Court has already allowed an appeal by an assessee from a judgement of <ORG> to the contrary viz It has been brought to our notice also that <ORG> has recently invalidated the levy of the cess in <ORG> <ORG> CWJC and connected cases in a judgement dated following <ORG> Madhya Pradesh We now turn to the provisions of Madhya Pradesh Act of We are concerned only with Part IV which levies a cess not on land in general which could be referred to Entry or Entry but only on land held in connection with mineral rights which in the State are principally in regard to coal and limestone For the reasons which have already been discussed in relation to the Orissa Statute we uphold this conclusion It held further that the levy was not covered by Entry or Entry of List II and was therefore ultra vires It observed It is significant to note that cess is not imposed on all land and that it is not dependent either on the extent of the land held in connection with mineral rights or on the value thereof The subject matter of tax therefore is major mineral raised from the land held in connection with mineral right The tax is not dependent on the extent of the land held in connection with mineral rights It is not case where all land is liable to payment of cess that the liability is assessed on the basis of the value of the land and that the measure of the tax in so far as land held under a mining lease is concerned is the value of the minerals produced Under the impugned Act value of the land or of the minerals produced does not play any part in the levy of cess The quantity of major minerals produced from the land determines the liability to pay tax In these circumstances the impugned levy cannot be held to be a tax on land which is covered by Entry of the State List The subject matter of tax is therefore not covered by Entry of the State List As for Entry after referring <NAME> the Court observed Now from a perusal of of the Act it would be clear that in the instant case by the charging section tax is not imposed on the mineral rights of every holder of mining lease The tax is levied on minerals produced in land held under mining lease In these circumstances the tax levied by the Act cannot be held to be a tax covered by Entry of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution The court however expressed an opinion in paras to of the judgment that in case the levy could be treated as a tax imposable under Entry or of List II in the Second Schedule to the Constitution such power has not been taken away by the provision of the MMRD Act We may add that a Bench of this Court has already dismissed the <ORG> petition for leave to appeal from the judgment of <ORG> etc It is brought to our notice that <ORG> after <ORG> has reaffirment its conclusions in <ORG> and <ORG> <ORG> No of in the light of <ORG> THE REFUND ISSUE Having thus concluded that the levy of cess under the Orissa Bihar and Madhya Pradesh enactments is invalid it becomes necessary to consider the logical consequences of such a conclusion For the States however reliance is placed on the following observations in para of the judgement in <ORG> to contend to the contrary Cess has been realised on that basis for the organisation of village and town panchayats and comprehensive programme of measures had been framed under the National Extension of Service Scheme to which our attention was drawn Mr <NAME> further submitted that the Directive Principles of <ORG> Policy embodied in the Constitution enjoined that the <ORG>s should take steps to organise village panchayats and endow them with power and authority as may be necessary to enable them to function as units of self government and as the amounts have been realised on that basis it at all we should declare the said cess on reality to be ultra vires prospective In other words the amounts that have been collected by virtue of the said provision should not be declared to be illegal retrospectively and the <ORG> made liable to refund the same We see good deal of substance in this submission After all there was a decision of this Court in <NAME> case and amounts have been collected on the basis that the said decision was the correct position Certain other circumstances have also been brought to our notice in this connection i Several States have preceded on the basis that they are entitled to levy a cess of the nature in question Analysing the various judgments delivered in that case he submitted that while <NAME> and four other judges pp approved of the applicability of this doctrine in India five other judges spoke against it pp and and the eleventh judge was neutral He therefore submitted that the judges who decided Golaknath were equally divided on the issue and so there is no reason disdained of the <ORG> binding on us In India however the application of the doctrine particularly in the context of an issue regarding the validity of a tax levy would run counter to specific provisions contained Articles and of the Constitution There is no scope for and no room for the exercise of any discretion by the <ORG> to say that there articles of the Constitution notwithstanding they would treat the legislation to be valid for a certain period or for certain purposes He urged that in some at least of the cases here there is no averment much less evidence of any irreparable hardship that is likely to result if a refund is ordered In addition to the above general arguments reliance had also been placed by the assessees on certain specific interim orders passed in these cases and it has been contended that these orders should be given effect to or at least taken into account in deciding the issue of the final relief to be granted It is therefore necessary to refer to these orders i In A Nos of there is no interim order staying recovery of the cess at all except of the arrears for the period from to and even this was made subject to the furnishing of a bank guarantee by the assessee ii In A of there was initially on an order of stay of recovery of cess on the furnishing of bank guarantees It is pointed out that when the levy of cess first came into force <ORG> who supplied coal to the assessees had challenged the levy of cess by a writ petition and obtained an interim injunction order but eventually withdrew the writ petition But simultaneously the said company wrote to the assessee that the amounts of cess which were collected from the assessee would be kept in a suspense account and that after a deci sion is rendered by a court of law it will be decided whether they should be deposited with the <ORG> against cess or be refunded to the assessees It was made clear that in case the levy of cess is held invalid there will be no hitch in refunding the amount On the assessee filed a writ petition challenging the levy as it was enahanced from to from Thereupon the assessee has preferred the unnumbered SLP on and SLP on respectively against the original judgement dated and the order on the review petition dated iv In the Bihar case there was an interim order on to the following effect On the stay application there will be no stay of recovery of cess but in case appellants succeed in appeal in this Court the excess amount so recovered will bepaid to the appellants with interest at the rate of from the date of recovery This was modified on in view of the judgement in <ORG> which had been delivered by this time and it was directed that the State of Bihar should not also enforce any demand for cess for the quarters ending December and thereafter until further orders Counsel for the assessees from Bihar Sri Chidambaram and <ORG> stated that they seek compliance with the order dated and would not insist on refund of cess collected earlier to that date When this order was passed <ORG> moved an application praying that instead of the monies being kept in deposit in bank account by <ORG> it will be conducive to public interest if the <ORG> is permitted to utilise the moneys in mineral areas development programs and that the <ORG> would abide by such terms as the <ORG> may impose at the time of final decision The <ORG> found this request reasonable and passed the following order on The order dated passed in the above appeal is modified as follows The amount deposited by <ORG> in a separate account in the <ORG> in accordance with the directions issued by this Court on shall be paid to <ORG> of Madhya Pradesh In the event of <ORG> failing in this appeal the amount received by <ORG> under this order shall be refunded by that Government within three months from the date of the judgement to <ORG> with interest at per annum to disburse in favour of those who had paid it subject to such directions which this court may give in its judgement Fresh applications were filed by the <ORG> in a number of the other appeals seeking similar direction as in A but the request does not show that any such order were passed in appeal other than A We have given our earned consideration to these contentions and were are of opinion that the ruling in <ORG> concludes the issue There the <ORG> was specifically called upon to consider an argument that even if the statutory levy should be found invalid the <ORG> may not give directions to refund amounts already collected and the argument found favour with the bench of seven judges We are bound by their decision in this regard The directions now impugned were given in the interest of equity and justice after due consideration and we cannot take a contrary view In our view we need enter into a discussion of the principles of prospective validation enunciated by at lease some of the Judges in Golaknath supra as the direction in <ORG> can be supported on another well settled principle applicable in the area of the writ jurisdiction of <ORG>s The declaration regarding the invalidity of a provision and the determination of the relief that should be granted in consequence thereof are two different things and in the latter sphere the <ORG> has and must be held to have certain amount of discretion It is a well settled proportion that it is open to the <ORG> to grant could or restrict the relief in a inner most appropriate to the situation before it is insuch a way as to advance the interests of justice For instance there are cases where a comes to the conclusion that the termination of the services of an employee is invalid yet in refrains from giving him benefits of reinstatement i continuity in service on back wages In such cases the direction of the <ORG> does not result in a person being denied the benefits that should flow to him as a logical consequence of a declaration inhis favour One of the commonest issue that arose in the context of the situation we are concerned with is where a person affected by an illegal exaction files an application for refund under the provisions of the relevant statute of files a suit to recover the taxes as paid under a mistake of law In such a case the <ORG> can grant relief only to extent permissible under the relevant rules of limitation Even if he files an application for refund or a suit for recovery of the taxes paid for several years the relief will be limited only to the period in regard to which the application for refund or a suit for recovery of the taxes paid for several years the relief will be limited only to the period in regard to which the application or suit is not barred by limitation If even this instance is sought to be distinguished as a case where the <ORG> hands are tied by limitations inherent in the form of forum in which the relief is sought let us consider a very case where a petitioner seeks relief against an illegal exaction in a writ petition filed under Article In this situation the question has often arisen whether the petitioner prayer for refund of taxes collected over an indefinite period of years should be granted once the levy is found to be illegal This is one of the reasons why there has been an understandable hesitation on the part of <ORG>s in answering the above question in the affirmative SCR the respondents who were dealers in tobacco in the <ORG> of Madhya Bharat filed a writ petition under Article of the Constitution for the issue of writ of mandamus directing the refund of sales tax collected from them on the ground that the impugned tax was violative of Article a of the Constitution and that they had paid the same under a mistake of law It was contended on behalf of the <ORG> that even if the provision violated the fundamental rights <ORG> should not exercise its discretionary power of issuing a writ of mandamus directing refund since there was unreasonable delay in filing the petition While agreeing that the <ORG>s have the power for the purposes of enforcement of fundamental rights and statutory rights to give a consequential relief by ordering repayment of any money realised by the government without authority of law the <ORG> said At the same time we cannot lose sight of the fact that the special remedy provided under Article is not intended to supersede completely the modes of obtained relief by an action in a civil court or to deny defends legitimately open in such actions It has been made clear more than once that the power to give relief under Article is a discretionary power This is specially true in the case of power to issue writs in the nature of mandamus Among the several matters which <ORG> rightly take into consideration in the exercise of that discretion is the delay made by the aggrieved party in seeking the special remedy and what excuse there is for it Another matter which can be rightly taken into consideration is the nature of the facts and law that may have to be decided as regarded the availability of consequential relief Thus where as in these cases a person comes to the <ORG> for relief under Article on the allegations that he has been assessed to tax under a void legislation and having paid it under a mistake is entitled to get it back if it the <ORG> finds that the assessment was void being made under a void provision of law and the payment was made by mistake it is still not bound to exercise its discretion directing repayment Whether repayment should be ordered in the exercise of this discretion will depend in each case of its own facts and circumstances It is not easy nor is it desirable to lay down any rules of universal application it may however be stated as a general rule that if there has been unreasonable delay the <ORG> ought not ordinarily to lend its aid to a party by this extraordinary remedy of mandamus The <ORG> further pointed out that the delay may be considered unreasonable even if it is less than the period of limitation prescribed for a civil action for the remedy but where the delay is more than this period it will almost always be proper for the court to hold that it is unreasonable Since the petitioner did not comply with the condition the sales tax officer forfeited the sum under of the Bombay Sales Tax Act A writ petition was filed by the petitioner contending that infringed Articles and of the Constitution and hence they were not liable to repay the amount This was dismissed on the ground that they had defrauded their customers and therefore not entitled to any relief even if there was a violation of fundamental rights Subsequently when coercive proceedings were taken for recovering the amounts as arrears of land revenue the petitioners paid the amounts in Much later there was a decision of this <ORG> striking down the corresponding provision of the Bombay Sales Tax Act as ultra vires The petitioners thereupon filed a writ petition under Article of the Constitution claiming a refund of the amounts paid by them in consequence of the recovery proceedings It was held by four of the five learned Judges of this <ORG> that the writ petition should be dismissed on the ground of laches Chief Justice <NAME> held that though Article gives the right to move the <ORG> by appropriate proceedings for enforcement of fundamental rights and <ORG> cannot place any hindrance in the way of an aggrieved person once the matter reached this court the extent or manner of interference was for the <ORG> to decide The learned Chief Justice pointed out that this <ORG> had put itself in restraint in the matter of petitions under Article For example if a party had already moved High <ORG> under Article this court would refuse to interfere Similarly in inquiring into belated and stale claims this <ORG> should take note of evidence of neglect of the petitioner own rights for a long time or of the rights of innocent parties which might have merged by reason of the delay It was possible for this <ORG> to lay down any specific period as the ultimate limit of action and the case will have to be considered on its own facts On the facts of the case before it the majority found that the petitioner had by his own conduct abandoned his litigation years ago and could not be permitted to resume it several years later merely because some other person had got the statue declared unconstitutional was of the view that on the facts of the case there was no delay but that the period under the Limitation Act should not be applied to such cases and that a period of one year should be taken as a period beyond which the claim would be considered a stale claim unless the delay is explained Such a practice the learned Judge observed would not destroy the guarantee under Article because the article nowhere lays down that a petition however late should be entertained Only <NAME> was emphatic that laches or limitation should be no ground to deny relief The learned Judge observed for brevity we quote from head note Since the right given to the petitioners under Article is itself a fundamental right and does not depend on the discretionary powers of this <ORG> as in the case of Article it is inappropriate to equate the duty imposed on this <ORG> to the powers of Chancery <ORG> in England or the equitable jurisdiction of <ORG>s in the United States The facts that the petitioner have no equity in their favour is an irrelevant circumstance in deciding the nature of the right available to an aggrieved party under Article This <ORG> is charged by the Constitution with the special responsibility of protecting and enforcing the fundamental rights and hence laches on the part of an aggrieved party cannot deprive him of his right to get relief under Article In fact law reports do not show a single instance of this <ORG> refusing to grant relief on the grounds of delay If this <ORG> could refuse relief on the ground of delay the power of the <ORG> under Article would be discretionary power and the right would cease to be a fundamental right The provisions contained in the Limitation Act do not apply to proceedings under Articles and and if these provisions of the Limitation Act are brought in indirectly to control the remedies conferred by the Constitution it would be a case of <ORG> indirectly abridging the fundamental rights which this court in <NAME> case The fear that forgotten claims and discarded right against Government may be sought to be enforced after the lapse of a number of years if fundamental rights are held to be enforceable without any time limit is an exaggerated one for after all a petitioner can only enforce an existing right Once the principle that the <ORG> has a discretion to grant or decline refund is recognised the ground on which such discretion should be exercised is a matter of consideration for the <ORG> having regard to all the circumstances of the case To give an instance in recent years the question has often arisen whether a refund could be refused on the ground that the person who seeks the refund has already passed on the burden of the illegal tax to others and that to grant a refund to him would result in his unjust enrichment This issue has been referred to a larger Bench of this <ORG> and its is not necessary for us to enter into that question here But we see no reason why the vital interests of the <ORG> taken note of by the learned judges in <ORG> should not be a relevant criterion for deciding that a refund should not be granted For the reasons discussed above we are of opinion that though the levy of the cess was unconstitutional there shall be no direction to refund the assessees of any amounts of cess collected until the date on which the levy in question has been declared unconstitutional Though there are the dates of the Judgement of the appropriate <ORG> which may not constitute a declaration of law within the scope of Article of the constitution it cannot be gainsaid that the <ORG> cannot on any grounds of equity be permitted to retain the cess collected on and after the date of <ORG> judgement It is submitted that the condition imposed or undertakings given to this effect and recorded at the time of passing interim orders in the various cases should be given implemented But we agree that to the extend refunds of amounts of cess collected after the relevant dates are permissible on the basis indicated by us the <ORG> should refund those amounts to the assessees directly or to the <NAME> from whom they were collected with interest at the rate directed by this <ORG> or mentioned in the undertaking from the date of the relevant judgment to the actual date of repayment
