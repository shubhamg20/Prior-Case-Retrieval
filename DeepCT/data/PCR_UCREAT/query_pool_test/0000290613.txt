These two tax revision cases give rise to a common question of law for our consideration and hence they are disposed of by a common order On appeals filed by the dealers <ORG> held that galvanised plain or corrugated sheets and sheets fell within iron and steel entry No in the Third Schedule to the Act and as the sales effected by the dealers were not the first sales those sales were exempted from payment of sales tax The sales of iron and steel are made taxable at the point of first sale at paise in a rupee The said entry defines iron and steel thus Iron and steel that is to say a pig iron and iron scrap iron plates sold in the same form in which they are directly produced by the rolling mills steel scraps steel ingots steel billets steel bars and rods i steel plates ii steel sheets iii steel bars and tin bars iv rolled steel Sections and tool alloy steel sold in the same form in which they are directly produced by the rolling mills If there is no such possibility it would be a different commodity but if there is such a possibility it would be the same commodity Hence it was urged by the learned counsel appearing for the <ORG> that <ORG> erred in holding that the galvanised plain and corrugated sheets and sheets fall within the entry iron and steel The learned counsel <NAME> appearing for the dealers on the other hand submitted that iron and steel are not sold as such but are sold in acceptable forms and shapes and merely because iron and steel are put to some process for bringing them into acceptable forms and shapes for their sales i into galvanised or sheets they do not cease to be iron and steel In order to decide the question referred to us we must know the exact nature of the commodities known as galvanised plain or corrugated sheets and sheets The corrugations made in one direction give it greatly increased stiffness and adapt it to numerous purposes for which it would otherwise be less suitable The sheet metal is corrugated by passing between ridged rollers It comes out in the commercial form and is frequently subjected to a process of coating with zinc to protect from oxidation and is then known as galvanised corrugated iron It is used widely for roofing and walling barns sheds warehouses and other buildings Corrugated iron sheets are thus nothing but iron sheets sheets of iron corrugated that is wrinkled for the purpose of making them more rigid and giving them increased stiffness so that they become more suitable for roofing and walling than they would otherwise be as flat iron sheets They are merely iron sheets with their shapes altered to make them more adaptable and useful for being used as iron sheets for roofing and walling The learned Chief Justice observed that It is no doubt true that iron sheets when corrugated cease to be raw materials for manufacture or fabrication of goods and they can be used only as corrugated iron sheets for roofing and walling but on that account they do not cease to be iron sheets having the essential character of iron It may be that by reason of alteration of shape iron sheets may cease to be usable for any purpose other than roofing or walling but they still remain iron sheets and do not lose the essential character of iron which they possessed as flat iron sheets before corrugation The question as to when a commodity would lose its essential character of the raw material and becomes a different or a product of the raw material is one of degree and where precisely to draw the dividing line is a pretty difficult task All enumerated under that head either in their crude form or in their manufactured stage or in any of the forms listed under the sub headings a and are treated as various forms of iron and steel <ORG> rejected the contention holding that this word must be construed not in any technical sense nor from the botanical point of view but as understood in common parlance It has not been defined in the Act and being a word of every day use it must be construed in its popular sense meaning that sense which people conversant with the subject matter with which the statute is dealing would attribute to it The learned Judges observed that in interpreting items in statutes like the Sales Tax Act resort should be had not to the scientific or technical meaning of such terms but to their popular meaning or the meaning attached to them by those dealing in them that is to say to their ordinary sense Both the <ORG> as well as the learned Judges of <ORG> upheld the dealer contention in regard to the sale of refined oil but rejected it in so far as it related to the sale of hydrogenated oil The <ORG> as well as <ORG> held that the hydrogenated oil ceased to be groundnut oil by reason of the chemical changes which took place and which resulted in the acquisition of new properties including the loss of its fluidity Before <ORG> the question that was raised for their decision was whether if beyond the process of refinement of the oil the oil was hardened again by the use of chemical processes it was rendered any the less groundnut oil In regard to that question the Advocate General late <NAME> laid stress on two facts i while normally oil was a viscous liquid the hydrogenated oil was semi solid and that this change in its physical state was itself indicative of a substantial modification of the identity of the substance and ii in the course of hydrogenation the oil absorbed two atoms of hydrogen and there was an inter molecular change in the content of the substance The oil in question must be from groundnuts and secondly the commodity must be oil The addition of the hydrogen atoms was effected in order tosaturate a portion of the oleic and linoleic constituents of the oil and render the oil more stable thus improving its quality and utility But neither mere absorption of other matter nor inter molecular changes necessarily affect the identity of a substance as ordinarily understood The change here is both additive and inter molecular but yet it could hardly be said that rancid groundnut oil is not groundnut oil It would undoubtedly be very bad groundnut oil but still it would be groundnut oil and if so it does not seem to accord with logic that when the quality of the oil is improved in that its resistance to the natural processes of deterioration through oxidation is increased it should be held not to be oil There is no use to which the groundnut oil can be put for which the hydrogenated oil could not be used nor is there any use to which the hydrogenated oil could be put for which the raw oil could not be used In the end the learned Judge held that the hydrogenated oil will continue to be groundnut oil notwithstanding the processing which was merely for the purpose of rendering the oil more stable thus improving its keeping qualities for those who desire to consume groundnut oil It was contended on behalf of the <ORG> that patasa harda and alchidana bore a distinct and different name from sugar and were not commercially purchased or sold as sugar and therefore they were commodities different from sugar It was held that they fell within the definition of sugar In <NAME> <NAME> a question arose before <ORG> whether chira and muri could be said to be covered by the words all cereals and pulses including all forms of rice It involves the process of boiling paddy its dehydration frying and flattening Muri involves the process of soaking boiling and dehydration of paddy and the removal of husks Although the when so transformed bore a different name and could not be commonly recognised as rice <NAME> observed that it seemed to him that those commodities could be regarded more as forms of rice than products thereof and were therefore exempt from the payment of tax under the Assam Sales Tax Act A sales tax statute being one levying a tax on goods must in the absence of a technical term or a term of science or art be presumed to have used an ordinary term as coal according to the meaning ascribed to it in common parlance Viewed from that angle both the merchant dealing in coal and a consumer wanting to purchase it would regard coal not in its geological sense but in the sense as ordinarily understood and would include charcoal in the term coal <ORG> also observed that While interpreting items in statutes like the Sales Tax Act resort should be had not to the scientific or technical meaning of such terms but to their popular meaning or the meaning attached to them by those dealing in them that is to say to their commercial sense Scrap iron purchased was merely re rolled into bars flats and plates They were processed for convenience of sale They did not in the process lose their character as iron and steel The dealer sold iron and steel in the shape of bars flats and plates and the customer purchased iron and steel in that shape <ORG> held that bars flats and plates sold by the assessee were iron and steel which were exempted under the notification From the aforesaid discussion it emerges that a taxing statute like the Sales Tax Act must in the absence of a technical term or a term of science or art be presumed to have used an ordinary term according to the meaning ascribed to it in common parlance The test of possibility of substitution of the one for the other so far as the consumers or purchasers are concerned cannot be said to be a decisive or the only test for determining whether the sold was the same or different from the specified in the entry in the schedule to the Sales Tax Act Neither mere absorption of other matter nor any inter molecular changes effected in processing the raw material necessarily affect the identity of the as ordinarily understood by the dealers or consumers It is in this background of decided cases and by applying the tests laid down by those cases that we will now have to decide whether or not galvanised plain of corrugated sheets and sheets are different from iron and steel specified in entry No in the Third Schedule to the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act By the process of galvanisation and corrugation the iron and steel do not lose their essential character as iron and steel when the resulting are sold as galvanised plain or corrugated sheets Since the sales of those are not the first sales effected by the dealers but are the second sales the dealers are not liable to pay the sales tax thereon The <ORG> shall pay the costs of these references to the dealers
