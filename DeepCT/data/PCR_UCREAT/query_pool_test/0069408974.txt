The background in which the question has come up for consideration may first be noticed <ORG> <ORG> was directed by orders of this Court dated th November to inspect and ascertain the impact of mining operation on the Badkal Lake and Surajkund ecologically sensitive area falling within the State of Haryana <ORG> on the basis of the recommendations made in the report stopped mining operations within the radius of kms of Badkal Lake and Surajkund It is considered necessary to prepare a Regional Environmental Management Plan for urgent implementation to enable eco friendly regional development in the area On consideration of the reports this Court came to the conclusion that the mining activities in the vicinity of tourist resorts are bound to cast serious impact on the local ecology The Court further directed the Director <ORG> to enforce all the recommendations of NEERI contained in para of its report so far as the mining operations in the State of Haryana are concerned On th May this Court directed the Chief Secretary <ORG> to stop within hours all mining activities and pumping of ground water in and from an area upto kms The question to be considered is whether the order shall be made absolute or vacated or modified It may be noted that <ORG> was constituted by <ORG> under notification dated th January issued in exercise of power under Section of the Environment Protection Act for short the EP Act Mr <NAME> was appointed its Chairman The <ORG> was constituted with a view to protect and improve the quality of environment and preventing controlling and abetting environmental pollution The <ORG> has jurisdiction over the National Capital Region as defined in clause of Section of the National Capital Region Planning Board Act The mining sites visited are located in the villages of Anangpur Pali Mohabatabad and Mangar which fall within the notified area of km radius from the Delhi border in the Faridabad district <ORG> Ist Report and Recommendations The <ORG> gave its report dated th August At the time of visit there was no mining taking place There was clear evidence of violation of the following conditions We saw no evidence of any afforestation or even dust minimising efforts being undertaken in the areas that are being mined In August <ORG> had issued a notification under the Punjab Land Preservation Act banning the clearing and breaking up the land not under cultivation quarrying of stone in the Badkal area without prior permission of the forest department Earlier it had already issued a similar notification for the Pali area for years It directed that failure to comply with the recommendations may result in the closure of the mining operations Mining should commence only after the environmental management plan EMP is approved by a designated authority There is no evidence of an environmental management plan being adhered to in this region Compliance with groundwater related regulations The NOC given by <ORG> includes an explicit condition regarding ground water That the mine owner will ensure that there is no discharge of effluent of ground water outside lease premises Even the Haryana government affidavit in court accepts that pumping of ground water is taking place though it attempts to soften the issue by arguing that it is only being done in a few cases However we do not have any estimate of the money that has been given to villagers from this revenue But there was little evidence in these poor and destitute villages that any effort had been made to share the proceeds with them It has been said to the court in that matter that <ORG> is intending to widen the road and bids have even been issued to this effect In a related case <ORG> has directed on a <ORG> enquiry on the basis of a public interest litigation filed by a journalist <ORG> also noted the bias of <ORG> to shield the offenders and has said that because there is prima facie evidence of the involvement of a person who holds the high position of the cabinet minister in the state the enquiry should be done by <ORG> During the examination of the case <ORG> was told of other persons involved in the mining activity who are highly influential and part of the ruling political parties in the state and <ORG> The area under consideration forms part of Aravalli range from where mining of silica sand and other construction material was being carried out During the field visit it was reported by local people that during the dewatering of mines there was decline in ground water levels and reduction in discharge in surrounding wells whereas after stoppage of pumping the rise in water levels and increase in discharge has been reported It has been observed that drainage pattern of the area has been modified due to haphazard mining and dumping of waste material which has bearing on natural path of ground water flow in the area The Committee was also permitted to associate such other organizations or persons as it may deem fit and proper for the purpose of inspection The observations made as a request of inspection in regard to each mine are as follows The numbers indicated in parenthesis are serial number of mines given in the list of mines furnished by <NAME> senior advocate to <ORG> that was forwarded to <ORG> It is also stated in the report that the geology and geomorphology of the area comprises oldest exposed lithology with upland units The NOC given by <ORG> includes an explicit condition regarding ground water That the mine owner will ensure that there is no discharge of effluent or ground water outside lease premises The <ORG> while reaffirming the recommendations that had been made in its earlier report dated th August made the following recommendations The overall assessment of the environmental impact of the mining activities in the area especially its implication for ground water level in the region reaffirms <ORG> assessment presented in its earlier report <ORG> upholds its earlier recommendations made vide the report submitted to <ORG> on August <ORG> is concerned that if mining is allowed to continue in this area it will have serious implications for the groundwater reserve which is the only source of drinking water in the area If mining could not be stopped in so many pits even after reaching groundwater level there is no guarantee that even some of those mines still at the surface level will abide by the stipulated norms when they reach the water table Submissions for Confirming or varying Order dated th May Having regard to the ground realities as reflected in the aforesaid reports should the order passed on th May be varied is the question The continuance of the order has been strenuously objected to by the mining lease holders and also by <ORG> Mr <NAME> learned <NAME> and Mr <NAME> Advocate petitioner in person and Mr <NAME> for <ORG> have made submissions in support of closure of mining activity and for making the order dated th May absolute by prohibiting all mining activities and pumping of ground water in and from an area upto kms The notification in so far as material for the present purposes reads Whereas a Notification under Section and Section of the Environment Protection Act inviting objections against restricting certain activities in specified area of Aravalli Range which are causing Environmental Degradation in the Region was published in the Gazette of India Part II Section sub section ii vide dated th January And whereas all objections received have been duly considered by <ORG> Now therefore in exercise of the powers conferred by sub section and clause of sub section of Section of the Environment Protection Act read with rule of the Environment Protection Rules <ORG> hereby prohibits the carrying on the following process and operations except with its prior permission in the areas specified in the Table appended to this Notification i ii a All new mining operations including renewals of mining leases Existing mining leases in sanctuaries national Park and areas covered under Project Tiger and or Mining is being done without permission of the competent authority iii Cutting of trees iv Construction of any clusters of dwelling units farmhouses sheds community centers information centers and any other activity connected with such construction including roads a part of any infrastructure relating thereto The Central Government in <ORG> shall having regard to the guidelines issued by it from time to time for giving effect to the provisions of the said Act grant permission within a period of three months from the date of receipt of the application or where further information has been asked for from the applicant within a period of three months from the date of the receipt of such information or refuse permission within the said time on the basis of the impact of the proposed process or operation on the environment in the said area The said notification reads thus MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT AND FORESTS NOTIFICATION New Delhi the th November In exercise of the powers conferred by section of the Environment Protection Act hereinafter referred to as the said Act read with sub rule of rule of the Environment Protection Rules <ORG> hereby delegates the powers conferred on it to take measures for protecting and improving the quality of the environment and preventing controlling and abating environmental pollution to be exercised also by the State Governments as notified in the Notification of the Government of India in the <ORG>s NO dated th May subject to certain conditions which are

Governments to take necessary action under section of the said Act in respect of cases where the project proponents fail to implement the conditions The <ORG> concerned shall initiate steps to prepare a Master Plan for the development of the area covered by the Notification dated th May integrating environmental concerns and keeping in view the future land use of the area This Master Plan shall be prepared by the concerned state agency approved by the competent authority and finally published within two years from the date of issue of this Notification in accordance with the procedure laid down in the Town and Country Planning Act or any other similar Act of the respective <ORG> Some controversy and confusion in respect of constitution of committees insofar as it relates to appointment of an expert from non government organization was brought to our notice but the delegation in favour of State Governments having been withdrawn now it is not necessary to examine this aspect The notification has been issued by <ORG> <ORG> in exercise of powers conferred by sub section and clause of sub section of Section of the EP Act read with clause of sub rule of Rule of the EP Rules stipulating that expansion or modernization of any activity if the pollution load is to exceed the existing one or a new project listed in Schedule I of the notification shall not be undertaken in any part of India unless it has been accorded environmental clearance by <ORG> in accordance with the procedure specified in the notification The notification dated th January to the extent material for the present purpose reads as under Whereas a notification under clause a of sub rule of rule of the Environment Protection Rules inviting objections from the public within sixty days from the date of publication of the said notification against the intention of <ORG> to impose restrictions and prohibitions on the expansion and modernization of any activity or new projects being undertaken in any part of India unless environmental clearance has been accorded by <ORG> or <ORG> in accordance with the procedure specified in that notification was published as No dated th January And whereas all objections received have been duly considered Now therefore in exercise of the powers conferred by sub section and clause of sub section of section of the Environment Protection Act read with clause of sub rule of rule of the Environment Protection Rules <ORG> hereby directs that on and from the date of publication of this notification in the Official Gazette expansion or modernization of any activity if pollution load is to exceed the existing one or a new project listed in Schedule I of this notification shall not be undertaken in any part of India unless it has been accorded environmental clearance by <ORG> in accordance with the procedure hereinafter specified in this notification Submission of incomplete data or plans for the second time would itself be a sufficient reason for <ORG> to reject the case summarily The said Committee of Experts shall have full right of entry and inspection of the site or as the case may be factory premises at any time prior to during or after the commencement of the operations relating to the project The assessment shall be completed within a period of ninety days from receipt of the requisite documents and data from the project authorities and completion of public hearing where required and decision conveyed within thirty days thereafter In order to enable <ORG> to monitor effectively the implementation of the recommendations and conditions subject to which the environmental clearance has been given the project authorities concerned shall submit a half yearly report to <ORG> Nothing contained in this Notification shall apply to a any item falling under entry nos and of the Schedule I to be located or proposed to be located in the areas covered by the Notifications No dated st February dated th February No dated th June and No dated th May Exemption for projects already initiated For projects listed in Schedule I to the notification in respect of which the required land has been acquired and all relevant clearances of <ORG> including NOC from the respective <ORG> have been obtained before th January a project proponent will not be required to seek environmental clearance from the <ORG> Reference may also be made to a notification issued by the Haryana Government on November with a view to enforce the recommendations of <ORG> contained in para of its report so far as mining operations in the State of Haryana are concerned In terms of the notification <ORG> and <ORG> were directed to impose the conditions mentioned in the notification while according environmental clearance We may also refer to the circular dated May issued by <ORG> noticing that in the past several units had come up in violation of the notification dated th January and a view had been taken earlier that such units are permitted to apply for environment clearance by st March For period of five years there was no circular or notification granting any time to apply for EIA under notification dated th January The applications were filed during the pendency of these matters under the order of this <ORG> <ORG> was constituted in terms of notification dated th September issued by the <ORG> <ORG> in exercise of power conferred by Section of the EP Act for the purposes of monitoring and ensuring compliance of the order of this <ORG> covering the subject matter of forest and wildlife and related issues arising out of the said order and one of the functions of the <ORG> in terms of the notification is to monitor the implementation of the orders of this <ORG> and place reports of non compliance before the <ORG> including in respect of encroachment and removals working plans compensatory afforestation plantations and other conservation issues In the order dated st October this <ORG> has observed that no mining activity can be carried out without remedial measures taking place and for this purpose it is necessary that environment impact assessment is done and the applications dealt with before any mining activity can be permitted In terms of order dated th November the <ORG> was asked to file its suggestions in regard to the time for considering the applications for grant of <ORG> Mining activities are permitted in a manner which is destroying the ground water table and also the deep aquifers thereby causing irreparable damage to the critical ground water reserves There is no effective mechanism to ensure compliance of various conditions stipulated while granting statutory approvals No deterrent action was taken against mines even in those cases where during monitoring serious violations and non compliance of conditions were found The <ORG> has made the following suggestions I For major mineral mines above hectare in Faridabad district mining activity may be allowed to be undertaken only after the required environmental clearances are accorded by <ORG> <ORG> ii the powers delegated to <ORG> by notification dated to grant environmental clearances in respect of areas of Gurgaon district falling within Aravalli notification dated requires to be reconsidered as the presumptions on the basis of which powers were delegated to <ORG> have been found to be incorrect iii mining activity may be allowed in respect of areas notified under Section and of the PLP Act which for the purpose of FC Act are forest even as per the <ORG> records only after obtaining prior approval under the said Act from the <ORG> iv all mining leases granted in respect of areas where plantations have been raised under the financial assistance received from any international donor agencies may be cancelled forthwith This Committee may be empowered to monitor the implementation of the conditions imposed while approving Mining Plans grants of environmental clearances and other approvals clearances Whenever any violation is detected the Committee should have the powers to direct closure of the defaulting mines and also to impose fines commensurate with the seriousness of the violation vii in addition to the above vi the Officials of <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> Director General of Mine Safety may independently monitor at least once in three months to ensure compliance of all statutory conditions viii the State Government may identify and notify officials who would ensure enforcement of the directions given by <ORG> and or the above mentioned officials ix no mining activity may be allowed without obtaining No Objection Certificate from <ORG> to ensure that the water table and the underground aquifers are not adversely affected before allowing resumption of mining activity in any approved mining lease the status of compliance of the conditions of the approved Mining Plans approved Environmental Management Plans environmental clearances and other statutory conditions clearances may be ascertained Suitable and adequate compensation penalty for non compliance of stipulations may be recovered otherwise such stipulations would remain only on paper xi in respect of forest area including areas notified under Section and net present value of the land leased out for mining may be recovered as per the Hon ble <ORG> order dated in I A No in Writ Petition Civil No forest matter xii a suitable system of securing adequate bank guarantee bank deposit or other personal guarantee from the mine owner may be worked out to ensure compliance of all statutory and other conditions xiii after considering the annual approved rate of mining and mineral deposits in the area optimum size of the mines may be determined in respect of approved mines to ensure optimum utilization of the mineral resources xiv presently the over burden is not stacked as per approved <ORG> which makes it practically impossible to carry out any reclamation work The report of <ORG> dated th February mentions that the State Government despite letters had not made available to the <ORG> the following information i mine wise details of stipulated conditions which have been fulfilled and those which have not been fulfilled ii details of five major mineral mines in Faridabad and Gurgaon Districts which have fulfilled all the conditions stated in the approved mining plans environmental and other clearances iii details of the mines where mining activity has been undertaken without obtaining requisite environmental clearance In the absence of the information as aforesaid the <ORG> gave its suggestions on the basis of information available to it which are as under i the ban on mining activity may continue up to km from Surajkund and Badkal Lakes as per <ORG> order dated ii each of the existing mines may be physically inspected by Inspection Team comprising officials of <ORG> <ORG> Director General of Mines Safety and <ORG> to report the specific conditions which have not been fulfilled violated especially in respect of a sectionwise benchwise mining to be done as per approved mining plan storage of top soil as per approved mining plan dumping of over burden in identified area as per the approval mining plan plantations as per Environmental Management Plan observance of mines safety Rules and Regulations damage to the plantations raised under externally aided projects foreign funding damage if any to the water table underground acquifers and compliance of environmental clearance stipulations The Inspection Team may submit the reports to <ORG> and <ORG> <ORG> with copies to <ORG> <ORG> for their comments and for carrying out verification if found necessary In respect of mining in Aravalli Hills in Gurgaon the relevant notifications dated th May th November and th January have been noticed earlier This <ORG> has repeatedly said that the right to live is a fundamental right under Article of the Constitution and it includes the right to of enjoyment of pollution free water and air for full enjoyment of life Article A inter alia provides that it shall be the duty of every citizen of India to protect and improve the natural environment including forest lakes rivers and wildlife and to have compassion for living creatures Article which provides that it shall be the duty of the <ORG> to raise the level of nutrition and the standard of living and to improve public health is also relevant in this connection The definition of sustainable development which Brundtland gave more than decades back still holds good The phrase covers the development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of the future generation to meet their own needs this <ORG> observed that sustainable development means the type or extent of development that can take place and which can be sustained by nature ecology with or without mitigation For carrying on any mining activity close to township which has tendency to degrade environment and are likely to effect air water and soil and impair the quality of life of inhabitants of the area there would be greater responsibility on the part of the entrepreneur When questioned the regulatory authorities have to show that the said authorities acted in the manner enjoined upon them If without degrading the environment or minimising adverse effects thereupon by applying stringent safeguards it is possible to carry on development activity applying the principles of sustainable development in that eventuality the development has to go on because one cannot lose sight of the need for development of industries irrigation resources and power projects etc Principle of Rio Conference of relating to the applicability of precautionary principle which stipulates that where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for proposing effective measures to prevent environmental degradation is also required to be kept in view Bearing in mind the aforesaid principles we have to consider the main question should the mining activity in areas in question be banned altogether or permitted and if so conditions to be provided therefor The reports and suggestions of <ORG> <ORG> and <ORG> have already been extensively noted <ORG> is empowered to make rules to provide for the manner in which rehabilitation of flora and other vegetation such as trees shrubs and the like destroyed by reason of any mining operation shall be made in the same area or in any other area selected by <ORG> whether by way of reimbursement of the cost of rehabilitation or otherwise by the person holding the mining lease Section inter alia casts a duty upon <ORG> to take all such steps as may be necessary for the conservation and systematic development of minerals in India and for the protection of environment by preventing or controlling any pollution which may be caused by mining operations and for such purposes <ORG> may by notification in the official gazette make such rules as it thinks fit The Mineral Concession Rules have been framed by <ORG> in exercise of the powers conferred by Section of the MMRD Act It cannot be accepted that by approving Mining Plan and Scheme by <ORG> Central <ORG> is deemed to have approved mining and it can commence forthwith on such approval Section of the MMRD Act and the Rules made in exercise of powers under the said section deal inter alia with the aspect of grant of mining of lease and not commencement of mining operations Rules made under Section however deal with commencement of mining operations and steps required to be taken for protection of environment by proventing or controlling any pollution which may be caused by mining operation Rules to contained in Chapter of the Mineral Conservation and Development Rules framed under Section of the MMRD Act deal with the measures required to be taken by the lessee for the protection of environment from any adverse effect of mining or irreversible consequences thereof The mining operations shall be carried out in such a manner so as to cause least damage to the flora of the area and nearby areas It provides that no mining should be granted to any party private or public without a proper mine management plan appraised from the environmental angle and enforced by adequate machinery Our attention was drawn by learned counsel appearing for lease holders to the part of national policy which provides that beneficiaries who are allowed mining and quarrying in forest land and in land covered by trees should be required to repair and re vegetate the area in accordance with established forestry practices to submit that the policy itself contemplates mining operations in the forest area For present we are not suggesting a complete ban of mining operations on forest land so long as it is possible to undertake the said operation on the sustainable development principles and after obtaining due approvals under various statutory provisions including Section of the Forest Conservation Act Further it is also not possible to accept the contention urged on behalf of the lease holders that only that part of such leased land where allegedly damage has been caused to plantation as a result of mining operations be excluded from mining and not the entire area of the lease There were dense forests with waterfalls and one could encounter a large number of wild animals Despite the increase of population resulting in increase of demand from the forest It cannot be questioned nor has been questioned that to save the ecology of the <ORG> mountain the laws have to be strictly implemented Report of <ORG> on Aravalli <ORG> <ORG> on being asked by <ORG> to conduct a study of environmental problems of Aravalli hills and preparation of action plan for restoration of environmental quality in Gurgaon district after extensive examination has submitted to <ORG> its final report in July Though the records of such lands are available at every village level map there is no record available in the district level in respect of these areas to undertake realistic appraisal and effective monitoring of mining and other projects at the macro level on such lands While noticing that notification dated th November inter alia made provision for preparing a master plan integrating the environmental concerns and the future land use of the area but the master plan prepared on th August does not inter alia address the issue of natural resource assessment and water Resource status the areas near crushing zone and active mining zone remain a matter of concern and concerted efforts have not been given to the quality of roads and the dust suppression measures to maintain the air quality within safe limits There is no identified land where overburden could be temporarily dumped prior to being utilized for void filling and for other purposes The environmental cost needs to be internalized in the cost of the product and there is need to limit the supply options There are number of mining projects etc which are already existing and there is also tremendous potential to further increase the industrial and the other development activities The report states that though the environmental upgradation measures need to be taken more seriously by the mine and other industrial operators there is need on the part of the <ORG> Government to immediately start these measures in the areas where degradation has already taken place No one has raised any objection to the recommendations contained in the report of <ORG> We accept the recommendations in principle The other option is to first constitute a monitoring committee directing it to individually examine and inspect mines from environmental angle in the light of the said recommendations and file a report in this Court in respect of individual mines with its recommendations for restart or otherwise as also recommendation if any for the payment by the mine operators and or by <ORG> towards environmental fund having regard to the precautionary principles and polluter pays principle and on consideration of that report to decide the aspect of modification of the order dated th May partially or entirely We are conscious of observations in <ORG> that measures for protecting the environment can be undertaken without stopping mine operations and also the suggestions of <ORG> to permit mining subject to the mine lease holders undertaking to comply with such conditions which remain to be complied but having regard to the enormous degradation of the environment in our view the safer and the proper course is to first constitute <ORG> get a report from it and only thereafter consider on individual mine to mine basis lifting of ban imposed in terms of order dated th May Before concluding this aspect we may note that assuming there was any ambiguity about the applicability of order dated th May to mining in Aravalli Range it is clarified that the said order would be applicable to all the mines in Aravalli hill range in Gurgaon district It inter alia provides that on and from the date of its publication in official Gazette expansion or modernization of any activity if pollution load is to exceed the existing one or a new project listed in Schedule A of this notification shall not be undertaken in any part of India unless it has been accorded environmental clearance by <ORG> in accordance with the procedure specified therein The contention urged on behalf of the lease holders is that the leases in question do not relate to expansion or modernization of any activity as postulated by the notification Reliance has been placed on a decision of this Court in <NAME> case supra holding that the notification is clearly prospective and inter alia prohibits the undertaking of a new project listed in Schedule I without prior environmental clearance from <ORG> No doubt the notification is prospective but the question here is whether it would be applicable when the aspect of renewal comes up for consideration after the issue of the notification The observations made in para of the said decision and relied upon by learned counsel for the lease holders have no relevance to determine the applicability of the notification at the stage of renewal In <NAME> case the environmental clearance had been granted in the year and this Court noticing that when it was granted by the Prime Minister whatever studies were available were taken into consideration it was known that the construction of the dam would result in submergence and the consequent effect which the reservoir will have on the ecology of the surrounding areas and various studies relating to environmental impact had been taken into consideration and that there was no obligation to obtain the statutory clearance under notification In the present case regarding the manner of grant of no objection certificate from environmental angle for proposed mining activity by way of illustration we may refer to the order dated th January issued by <ORG> whereby no objection certificate for renewal of lease was granted stipulating that the applicant <NAME> in respect of mining activity at village Anangpur district Faridabad shall also seeking environmental clearance of its mining project in compliance with this notification without even mentioning any time limit for it and admittedly till date that had not been done Further the letter dated th January sent to Principal Secretary of <ORG> by <ORG> Haryana shows how the State Government has been circumventing the legal requirements and permitting mining though a case under Forest Conservation Act rejecting the contention that approval at the stage of renewal was not necessary and also the plea that since the leaseholders had invested sum of money in mining operation it was the duty of the authorities to renew the lease it was held that having regard to the awareness that deforestation and ecological imbalances as a result of deforestation have become social menaces and the same should be prevented and that the concept that power coupled with the duty enjoined upon the respondents to renew the lease stood eroded by the mandate of the FC Act It was held that The primary duty was to the community and that duty took precedence In such cases the obligation to the society must predominate over the obligation to the individuals Here the case of the appellants is that they have invested large sums of money in mining operations Therefore it was the duty of the authorities that the power of granting permission should have been so exercised that the appellants had the full benefits of their investments It was emphasized that none of the appellants had committed any breach of the terms of grant nor were there any other factors disentitling them to such renewal While there was power to grant renewal and in these cases there were clauses permitting renewals it might have cast a duty to grant such renewal in the facts and circumstances of the cases specially in view of the investments made by the appellants in the areas covered by the quarrying leases but renewals cannot be claimed as a matter of right for the following reasons The rules dealt with a situation prior to the coming into operation of Act Act was an Act in recognition of the awareness that deforestation and ecological imbalances as a result of deforestation have become social menaces and further deforestation and ecological imbalances should be prevented Therefore the concept that power coupled with the duty enjoined upon the respondents to renew the lease stands eroded by the mandate of the legislation as manifest in Act in the facts and circumstances of these cases The primary duty was to the community and that duty took precedence in our opinion in these cases The obligation to the society must predominate over the obligation to the individuals SCC agreeing with views expressed in Ambica Quarry Workers it was held that the FC Act applies to renewals as well and even if there was a provision for renewal in the lease agreement on exercise of lessee option the requirement of the Act had to be satisfied before such renewal could be granted We are unable to accept the contention that the notification dated th January would not apply to leases which come up for consideration for renewal after issue of the notification The controversy is in respect of certain leases where area under the lease is covered under notification issued under Section and or of the Punjab Land Preservation Act Under Section of the aforesaid Act whenever it appears to <ORG> that it is desirable to provide for the conservation of sub soil water or the prevention of erosion in any area subject to erosion or likely to become liable to erosion such Government may by notification make a direction accordingly Section in respect of any specified village or villages or part or parts thereof comprised within the limits of any area notified under section the State Government may by special order temporarily regulate restrict or prohibit the quarrying of any stone or the burning of any lime at places where such stone or lime had ordinarily been so quarried or burnt prior to the publication of the notification under section In respect of some mining areas notifications have been issued under Section and in respect of some notifications have been issued both under Sections and The contention urged on behalf of <ORG> is that it was on account of erroneous view point of <ORG> Not only in their record the area has been shown as forest but the affidavits have been filed in this Court stating the area to be forest Reference in this connection may also be made to the affidavit dated th December filed by <NAME> Principal Chief Conservator of Forest Chandigarh Haryana in Civil Writ No On the facts and circumstances of the case we cannot permit <ORG> to take a compete summersault in these proceedings and contend that the earlier stand that the area is forest was under some erroneous impressions We may also note that assuming that there was any confusion or erroneous impression it ought to have been first sorted out at appropriate level and where affidavits had been filed in this Court clarifications orders sought before issue of the mining lease in respect of such area Impact of Mining on Ground Water Where during mining water level is touched <ORG> shall carve out that area and it was agreed on behalf of the leaseholders that they would co operate and not undertake any mining in such an area Non payment of royalty to the villagers A controversy has been raised about non payment of royalty by the leaseholders to villagers on whose behalf it was contended that the order dated th May prohibiting mining should not be varied till the leaseholders discharge their liability to pay royalty to the villagers On the other hand mine leaseholders dispute the claim put forth on behalf of the villagers and it has been submitted that no amount is payable by them and the villagers can make their claim if any from <ORG> We leave it open to be adjudicated before appropriate forum in accordance with law Leases in respect of minor mineral Though notification dated th January is not applicable to minor minerals but having regard to what we have discussed above in regard to degradation of environment and the required standard about the risk of harm to the environment or to human health to be decided in public interest according to reasonable person test and the report of <ORG> we direct <ORG> to examine the leases granted for extraction of minor mineral in light thereof and file its report The Committee would however bear in mind that the notification dated th January as such is not applicable to these leases It may be reiterated that if despite stringent conditions the degradation of environment continues and reaches a stage of no return this <ORG> may have to consider at a later date the closure of mining activity in areas where there is such a risk As earlier noticed as well it would not be expedient to lift the ban on mining imposed in terms of the order of this <ORG> dated th May before ensuring implementation of suggestions of <ORG> and other recommendations of experts <ORG> <ORG> and <ORG> The <ORG> is directed to consider the said applications within a period of weeks <ORG> With a view to monitor the overall eco restoration efforts in the Aravalli Hills and to provide technical support to the implementing organizations and also to monitor implementation of recommendations contained in reports referred herein it is necessary to constitute a <ORG> Besides above <ORG> is directed to appoint an officer from <ORG> to be a member of <ORG> The <ORG> would act as a nodal agency of <ORG> In case despite stringent condition there is an adverse irreversible effect on the ecology in the Aravalli hill range area at a later date the total stoppage of mining activity in the area may have to be considered <ORG> is directed to prepare a short term and long term action plan for the restoration of environmental quality of Aravalli hills in Gurgaon district having regard to what is stated in final report of <ORG> within four months
