What is motive what is foundation what is the difference between the two these are questions which are said to be still as baffling as they were when <NAME> in <NAME> vs <ORG> of Punjab SCC SCR AIR SC observed as under Again could it be that if you summarily pack off a probationer the order is judicially unscrutable and immune If you conscientiously seek to satisfy yourself about allegations by some sort of enquiry you get caught in the coils of law however harmlessly the order may be phrased And so this sphinx complex has had to give way in later cases In some cases the rule of guidance has been stated to be the substance of the matter and the foundation of the order When does motive trespass into foundation When do we lift the veil of form to touch the substance When the <ORG> says so These Freudian frontiers obviously fail in the work a day world But as we shall presently see the law on account of recent judgments concerning the services of a probationer is fairly well settled and there is no cause for being confounded or bewildered The perplexity which at one time surrounded the torrid question involved in this case has yielded to the clarity of reasons propounded by this <ORG> from time to time in recent times to which a reference shall be made during the course of this discussion He completed his period of probation on th of September but a year later on th of July his services were terminated by a simple notice in terms of Rule of the Temporary <ORG> Servants Termination of Service Rules The order of termination was challenged by the appellant before <ORG> which by its judgment dated allowed the claim petition and set aside the order dated by which the services of the appellant were terminated Respondents and thereafter approached the High <ORG> through a Writ Petition which was allowed on th of November and the judgment passed by the <ORG> was set aside It is further contended that the courts including the <ORG> constituted under the Public Services <ORG> Act have full jurisdiction to go behind the order to find out whether it was an order of termination simpliciter or it was an order passed by way of punishment It is pointed out that this aspect of the matter was considered by the <ORG> which on the basis of the facts set out in the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the respondents as also the entire service record of the appellant which was produced before it came to the conclusion that the order was punitive in nature Learned counsel for the respondents has on the contrary contended that the appellant was a temporary employee and therefore his services could be terminated at any time by giving him a month notice in terms of Temporary <ORG> Servants Termination of Service Rules In the Counter Affidavit filed before the <ORG> before which the order dated termination order was challenged by the appellant it was inter alia stated that on th of June while camping at Ghat Varanasi for Flood Relief Training a quarrel had taken place between two Constables as a result of which Constable <NAME> used filthy and unparliamentary language against Constable <NAME> He also caused injuries to Constable <NAME> by kicks and fists The respondents admitted in the counter affidavit that there was no adverse material against the appellant before the incident in question The original records which were produced before the <ORG> and were scrutinised by it indicated that the order by which the services of the appellant were terminated was passed on account of his alleged involvement in the quarrel between the constables at the Ghat Varanasi Camp A Varanasi and in the preliminary enquiry report he concluded at pages to that the petitioner along with others had indulged in a misconduct of hurling blows and used filthy language to the superior officers of the Department and he was found guilty along with others for the said misconduct and misbehaviour Thereafter on internal page the impugned order of termination dated was passed in respect of the petitioner and on the same day he was served the copy of the order It is contended that after completion of the period of probation the appellant had acquired permanent status and therefore his services could not have been terminated by a mere notice or a month pay in lieu thereof Recruits will be on probation for a period of two years except that a those recruited directly in <ORG> or <ORG> will be on probation for three years and those transferred to <ORG> will be governed by the directions contained in paragraph of the Police Regulations This <ORG> ruled that the permanent status can be acquired only by a specific order confirming the employee on the post held by him on probation Now it is well settled that the temporary <ORG> servants or probationers are as much entitled to the protection of Article of the Constitution as the permanent employees despite the fact that temporary government servants have no right to hold the post and their services are liable to be terminated at any time by giving them a month notice without assigning any reason either in terms of the contract of service or under the relevant statutory rules regulating the terms and conditions of such service The courts can therefore lift the veil of an innocuously worded order to look at the real face of the order and to find out whether it is as innocent as worded It was explained in this decision that inefficiency negligence or misconduct may have been the factors for inducing the <ORG> to terminate the services of a temporary employee under the terms of the contract or under the statutory Service Rules regulating the terms and conditions of service which to put it differently may have been the motive for terminating the services but the motive by itself does not make the order punitive unless the order was founded on those factors or other disqualifications SCR the order by which the services of the employee were terminated was an order simpliciter in nature which was innocuously worded but it was held by this <ORG> that the form of the order was not decisive and the <ORG> could go behind that order to find out whether it was founded upon the misconduct of the employee It was held that since no punitive action was taken against the appellant there was no question of the applicability of Article of the Constitution The services of a temporary servant or a probationer can be terminated under the rules of his employment and such termination without anything more would not attract the operation of Art The circumstances preceding or attendant on the order of termination of service have to be examined in each case the motive behind it being immaterial If the order visits the public servant with any evil consequences or casts an aspersion against his character or integrity it must be considered to be one by way of punishment no matter whether he was a mere probationer or a temporary servant An order of termination of service is unexceptionable form preceded by an enquiry launched by the superior authorities only to ascertain whether the public servant should be retained in service does not attract the operation of Art i an Enquiry Officer is appointed a charge sheet submitted explanation called for and considered any order of termination of service made thereafter will attract the operation of the said Article SCR AIR SC and it was laid down that in order to attract the provisions of Article it has to be seen whether the misconduct or negligence was a mere motive for the order of reversion or termination or whether it was the very foundation of that order It was again reiterated that the form of the order was not conclusive of its true nature and the <ORG> has to examine the entirety of circumstances preceding or attendant on the order of termination It was however laid down that if the order visits the employee with penal consequences the order would be punitive In the same year came the <ORG> decision of this <ORG> in <NAME> vs <ORG> of Punjab AIR SC SCR in which Motive and Foundation theory was reiterated and it was laid down that the question whether an order terminating the services of a temporary employee or a probationer was by way of punishment or not would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case The form of the order it was observed was not conclusive and an innocuously worded order terminating the services of a temporary employee or a probationer may in the facts of the case be found to have been passed on account of serious and grave misconduct in utter violation of Article of the Constitution This contention was not accepted and on a review of the entire case law including the Seven Judge Bench decision in <NAME> case supra it was laid down that the <ORG> has consistently held that the motive in passing an order of termination or reversion operating in the minds of the <ORG> was not a relevant factor for determining whether the order was passed by way of punishment Indeed we do not think that the principles of law declared and applied so often have really changed But the application of the same law to the different circumstances and facts of various cases which have come up to this <ORG> could create the impression sometimes that there is some conflict between different decisions of this <ORG> It is the rule deducible from the application of law to the facts and circumstances of a case which constitutes its ratio decidendi and not some conclusion based upon facts which may appear to be similar One additional or different fact can make a world of difference between conclusions in two cases even when the same principles are applied in each case to similar facts In this regard the form of the order will not be decisive and the <ORG> can lift the veil to see the true nature of the order The <ORG> observed that the substance not semblance governs the decision Given an alleged misconduct and a live nexus between it and the termination of service the conclusion would be dismissal even if full benefits as on simple termination are given and non injurious terminology is used On the facts and circumstances of that case it was held that the question whether the appellant who was a temporary servant should be retained in service directly arose during the drive launched to weed out unsuitable officers and it was for this reason that the termination order was upheld particularly as there was nothing to show that the termination order was made by way of punishment LLJ was a case of a temporary Constable in <ORG> whose services were terminated by an apparently innocuous order On scrutiny it was found that the services were terminated on account of his alleged participation in activities of unrecognised <ORG> Whether motive has become the foundation has to be decided by the <ORG> with reference to the facts of a given case It was also observed that since in regard to a temporary employee or an officiating employee an assessment of the service is necessary merely because the <ORG> proceeds to make an assessment and records its views it would not be available to be utilised to make the order of termination following such assessment punitive in character It was observed by this <ORG> that in the relationship of master and servant there is a moral obligation to act fairly SCR AIR SC was held to be per incuriam as in that case <NAME> case supra was not considered but the <ORG> did observe that if on an overall assessment of the work and conduct of the employee the authority competent in that behalf to terminate the service is satisfied that on account of the employee general unsuitability and inefficiency or misconduct it would not be in the public interest to retain him in service it may either terminate the services by an innocuous order or may proceed to take punitive action by holding a regular departmental enquiry It was held that the question whether the order by which the services were terminated was innocuous or punitive in nature had to be decided on the facts of each case after considering the relevant facts in the light of the surrounding circumstances It was urged before this <ORG> more than once including in <NAME> case supra that there was a conflict of decisions on the question of order being a simple termination order or a punitive order but every time the <ORG> rejected the contention and held that the apparent conflict was on account of different facts of different cases requiring the principles already laid down by this <ORG> in various decisions to be applied to a different situation The important principles which are deducible on the concept of motive and foundation concerning a probationer are that a probationer has no right to hold the post and his services can be terminated at any time during or at the end of the period of probation on account of general unsuitability for the post in question If for the determination of suitability of the probationer for the post in question or for his further retention in service or for confirmation an enquiry is held and it is on the basis of that enquiry that a decision is taken to terminate his service the order will not be punitive in nature But if there are allegations of misconduct and an enquiry is held to find out the truth of that misconduct and an order terminating the service is passed on the basis of that enquiry the order would be punitive in nature as the enquiry was held not for assessing the general suitability of the employee for the post in question but to find out the truth of allegations of misconduct against that employee In this situation the order would be founded on misconduct and it will not be a mere matter of motive Motive is the moving power which impels action for a definite result or to put it differently motive is that which incites or stimulates a person to do an act An order terminating the services of an employee is an act done by the employer What is that factor which impelled the employer to take this action If however there were allegations of serious misconduct against the employee and a preliminary enquiry is held behind his back to ascertain the truth of those allegations and a termination order is passed thereafter the order having regard to other circumstances would be founded on the allegations of misconduct which were found to be true in the preliminary enquiry Even after the completion of the period of probation under Para of <ORG> Regulations he continued in service in that capacity The termination was founded on the report of the preliminary enquiry as the employer had not held the preliminary enquiry to find out whether the appellant was suitable for further retention in service or for confirmation as he had already completed the period of probation quite a few years ago but was held to find out his involvement In this situation particularly when it is admitted by the respondent that the performance of the appellant throughout was unblemished the order was definitely punitive in character as it was founded on the allegations of misconduct There is another aspect of the matter Recruits will be on probation for a period of two years except that a those recruited directly in <ORG> or <ORG> will be on probation for three years and those transferred to <ORG> will be governed by the directions contained in paragraph of the Police Regulations In any case in which either during or at the end of the period of probation the Superintendent of Police is of opinion that a recruit is unlikely to make a good police officer he may dispense with his services Before however this is done the recruit must be supplied with specific complaints and grounds on which it is proposed to discharge him and then he should be called upon to show cause as to why he should not be discharged The recruit must furnish his representation in writing and it will be duly considered by the Superintendent of Police before passing the orders of discharge Where therefore the services of a probationer are proposed to be terminated and a particular procedure is prescribed by the Regulations for that purpose then the termination has to be brought about in that manner The rule being mandatory in nature compliance thereof would not alter the nature of the order passed against the probationer Immediately after quoting the Rule the <ORG> observed Notice to show cause whether the employment of the respondent should be terminated was by Rule made obligatory The <ORG> after considering that the <ORG> had complied with the requirements of Rule came to the conclusion that the order of termination of services of the probationer was not punitive in nature If such an opportunity is given to a probationer and his explanation in reply thereto is given due consideration there is in our opinion sufficient compliance of Generally speaking the purpose of a notice under is to ascertain after considering the explanation which a probationer may give whether he should be retained or not and in such a case it would be sufficient compliance with that rule if the grounds on which the probationer is considered unsuitable for retention are communicated to him and any explanation given by him with respect to those ground is duly considered before an order is passed <ORG> of Punjab supra the question of termination of services of a probationer was considered and it was laid down that the form of the order was not conclusive and the court could go behind the order to find out the real foundation of that order As we have already seen above there has been total non compliance with the provisions of Para of <ORG> Regulations and services of the appellant were terminated without ever issuing him any notice intimating the grounds on which his services were proposed to be terminated nor was his explanation ever obtained For the reasons stated above the appeal is allowed the impugned judgment passed by the High <ORG> is set aside and that of the Public Services <ORG> is restored but without any order as to costs
