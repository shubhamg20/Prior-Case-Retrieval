They allege in the plaint that they appointed the defendant as their agent to conduct business in Singapore for a period of years and as his conduct was found not to be satisfactory they sent another agent after the expiry of the years period and wrote to the defendant to hand over the business with the account books documents and cash on hand to the new agent that the defendant refused to hand over charge of the business to the new agent until and unless the accounts between him and the plaintiffs were settled and the letter containing the terms of the agency written by him to the plaintiffs called the salary chit was returned to him and a release deed was executed in his favour releasing him from all claims against him with reference to his agency that as the defendant was obdurate and as the plaintiffs feared that they might suffer heavy loss by the stoppage of business they consented to authorise their new agent to give a release to him that the defendant after getting the The plaintiffs pray that the release deed be declared void as having been obtained under coercion and that the defendant be directed to render an account of the transactions during the period he was their agent The defendant in his written statement denies that the release deed was obtained under coercion and avers that he acted honestly and diligently in his capacity as agent that he did not wrongly debit the plaintiffs with his losses that he did not improperly lend money to the customers and that the plaintiffs are estopped by their conduct from denying the validity of the release deed Two preliminary issues were framed by the Subordinate Judge Whether the acquittance granted to the defendant was done under the circumstances detailed in the plaint and hence voidable and are the plaintiffs entitled to call for an account of the defendant Whether the allegations in paragraphs and of the written statement are true and does it estop the plaintiffs from doing so The Subordinate Judge held that the release deed was obtained from the plaintiffs agent under coercion and that they did not ratify the release deed and directed an account to be taken The defendant has preferred this appeal He wrote to the plaintiffs Ex on th June charging the defendant with having debited them with losses sustained by him in exchange transactions on his own private account and saying that if he had done the business for the firm he would have taken their permission before embarking upon speculation in the exchange market on th November and informed him of their having sent <NAME> to take charge of the business that he should get the accounts prepared and closed and that he should come away without delay The following passage in the letter is important As soon as he arrives get the accounts prepared and closed and come without delay If there is something more to be collected better get it collected and make out a copy of the items that can be copied and come away after getting the accounts closed From this letter it is clear that the plaintiffs appointed a new agent and asked the defendant to come away from Singapore in other words they asked him to cease to be their agent at Singapore as soon as <NAME> went there and took charge of the business and insisted upon his being given a release deed in respect of any claim that the plaintiffs might make in respect of any of the transactions conducted by him as agent When he was told that it was not the proper course and that he might prepare and give the accounts as matters stood and that the accounts might be settled on going to the headquarters as usual he said definitely It cannot be done on th January to the plaintiffs in which he stated You should send my salary chit to <NAME> who has come here for the new account together with a letter signed by yourself and <NAME> and directing that the accounts documents etc <NAME> strongly advised the plaintiffs to consent to give a release deed to the defendant as otherwise the plaintiffs might sustain heavy loss owing to stoppage of business and that if so advised they might take steps against him afterwards After he was asked to hand over charge to <NAME> he had no right to withhold from the plaintiffs new agent their property <NAME> remained there for about months before he could get possession of the account books etc in order to carry on the business Coercion is defined in Section of the Contract Act as committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the Indian Penal Code or the unlawful detaining or threatening to detain any property to the prejudice of any person whatever with the intention of causing any person to enter into an agreement the amount lent by him to Tirupathi <NAME> IV the account books cash on hand and the vouchers were handed over to <NAME> by the defendant and he executed a power of attorney in <NAME> favour so as to enable him to collect the loans outstanding on mortgages <NAME> died in August and the plaintiffs sent a third agent named <NAME> It was necessary that <NAME> should get a fresh power of attorney from the defendant in order to realise the loans outstanding on mortgages was written by the solicitors of the plaintiffs to <NAME> on th April in which they informed him of the death of <NAME> in August and asked him whether he was willing to execute a fresh power of attorney in favour of the present agent to enable him to deal with the mortgages and any other matters that may arise on th April that everything had been done at the defendant request and there was no reason why he should require a fresh release and that their clients were unwilling to accede to that request The plaintiffs solicitors wrote to the defendant solicitors on th August We find that there are certain difficulties in connection with the making of a vesting order in Johore and that it would therefore be necessary to sue for a declaration and an order to execute the transfer The defendant solicitors replied that in view of the position he the defendant has taken up with regard to the Singapore property he regrets he is unable to execute transfers of the mortgage properties in Johore and that he will not oppose any order in the action if they undertake not to ask for any costs The defendant seems to have changed his mind as is clear from the letter of the plaintiffs solicitors to his solicitors dated th September He seems to have insisted that the counsel for the plaintiffs should make a statement that the plaintiffs ratified the arrangement under Ex As a mere vesting order on originating summons would not satisfy the requirements of the law obtaining in Johore the plaintiffs solicitors filed Suit No of in <ORG> praying for an order directing the defendant to execute in the name of <NAME> in manner conforming with the law in Johore such memoranda or other documents as may be necessary according to the laws of Johore to transfer each of the said charges to the plaintiffs or their present agent <NAME> son of <NAME> On th October they sent the transfers in duplicate to the defendant solicitors for his signature It is contended by Mr <NAME> for the plaintiffs that the counsel had no authority to make the statement that the plaintiffs acknowledge that the said release was and is in full force and of full effect and that it is for the defendant to show that the counsel was specially authorised to make it That the plaintiffs counsel made the statement contained in the order of <ORG> cannot be seriously disputed The only question is whether he had authority to bind his clients by the statement he made In <NAME> <NAME> CWN it was held that although a pleader has no power to compromise a suit unless he is specially authorised in that behalf he can bind his client by an admission of a question of fact provided that question of fact falls within the scope of the suit in which he has been retained The compromise was objected to and before the decree was drawn up one of the parties applied for an order to stay the drawing up of the compromise decree and to have the alleged compromise set aside and the suit retried The learned Chief justice observes at page There cannot I think be any reasonable doubt at the present day that counsel possesses a general authority an apparent authority which must be taken to continue until notice be given to the other side by the client that it has been determined to settle and compromise the suit in which he is actually retained as counsel and in the exercise of his discretion to do that which he considers best for the interest of his client in the conduct of the particular case in which he is so retained Here however the compromise extended to collateral matters to matters quite outside the scope of the particular case in which Mr <NAME> way retained as counsel and in order to bind the client it must be shown that Mr <NAME> had from his client a special authority to compromise and compromise upon the definite terms which are set up by the present respondents and refers to <NAME> <NAME> LR QB <NAME> <NAME> CBNS ER and <NAME> <NAME> LR QBD for the authority of a counsel to compromise on behalf of his client Here there was no settlement of collateral matters It was necessary to prove to the <ORG> that the mortgages which were standing in the name of the defendant were taken for the benefit of the plaintiffs that the defendant was a trustee of the plaintiffs and that the agency having terminated he was bound to make over the mortgage deeds to the plaintiffs These are some observations of <ORG> which may be taken as lending support to Mr <NAME> contention There are a number of cases which take a liberal view of the authority of a counsel to compromise suits in which he is engaged In <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> ER Sir <NAME> observes In the absence of evidence a Court will conclude that he had authority for it is not to be presumed that counsel would enter into an agreement without authority There is in this case evidence on both sides but after duly considering it I come to the conclusion that counsel had authority which would bind his client <ORG> ILR the plaintiffs instituted a suit for the recovery of the price of goods sold and delivered to the defendants and for damages in respect of goods of which it was alleged the defendants had refused to take delivery making a total claim of Rs in respect of goods sold and delivered but claimed that there was due to them from the plaintiffs a sum of Rs It was admitted that the attorney for the defendants who was present in <ORG> never asked the learned Counsel to settle the suit nor did he put any limitation on the authority or discretion of the learned Counsel in any respect to compromise the suit The following observation of the learned Chief Justice may well be applied to the present case In my judgment there is no evidence in this case that there was any limitation placed upon the authority of the learned Counsel I have a strong suspicion that the course which the learned Counsel took on behalf of the defendants was a wise one having regard to the nature of the suit and the admissions which the defendants made in the suit There are numerous cases English and Indian on the question of a counsel power to make admissions in or to refer to arbitration or compromise suits in which he is instructed The following propositions are deducible from the authorities A counsel has authority to make admissions in Court on behalf of his client on matters of fact relevant to the issues in the case in which he is engaged A counsel has authority to confess judgment withdraw or compromise or refer to arbitration the suit in which he is instructed if his doing so is for his client advantage or benefit even though he has no express authority from his client A counsel cannot without express authority agree to compromise or refer to arbitration matters unconnected with the subject matter of the suit in which he is instructed Where in the course of a suit a counsel makes an admission as to a collateral matter or gives up a doubtful claim which is not a subject matter of the suit there is a presumption that the counsel acts under instructions if the admission or the giving up of the doubtful claim is for the benefit of the client It is a question of fact in each case whether the counsel acts under instructions when he compromises or refers to arbitration matters not involved in the suit and the Court on a consideration of the probabilities and the circumstances of the case can find that the counsel acted on instructions even though there is no direct evidence on the point A counsel has no power to make an admission in or compromise or refer to arbitration a suit if he is instructed not to do so without express authority from his client All the circumstances of the case and the evidence on record the non examination by the plaintiffs of their agent <NAME> who instructed the counsel in the proceedings before <ORG> the absence of any statement in the nd plaintiff deposition that he or his brother the st plaintiff did not empower <NAME> to make the statement as to ratification contained in the judgment of <ORG> the urgency with which the mortgage deeds were required by the plaintiffs and the speedy manner in which the suit was decreed in plaintiffs favour owing to the defendant consent to accept service and remain ex parte and the readiness with which the defendant executed the transfer deed within a fortnight of the approval of the draft judgment by his solicitors lead to the irresistible conclusion that the plaintiffs counsel was specially authorised to make the statement that the plaintiffs acknowledged that the said release was and is in full force and of full effect Even if the counsel was not specially instructed to make the statement we hold that the circumstances of the case and the evidence on record fully justify the conclusion that he acted within his authority in making the above statement A decree has been passed embodying the statement by <ORG> and in pursuance of that decree the defendant signed the transfer deeds We have therefore no hesitation in holding that the plaintiffs by their counsel ratified the arrangement evidenced by <ORG> and they cannot now sue to set it aside In the result the appeal is allowed and the plaintiffs suit dismissed We therefore direct that each party do bear his costs throughout
