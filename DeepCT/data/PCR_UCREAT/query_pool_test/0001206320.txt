Arising out of No JAGANNADHA RAO Special leave granted in all the Special leave petitions Civil Appeal arising out of SLP No is filed by <ORG> against order of <ORG> dated passed by a Division Bench in an interlocutory appeal appointing a Receiver to take formal possession of the mortgaged properties which are subject matter of suit No of pending before a learned Single Judge of the said <ORG> on the Original Side The respondent <ORG> which is the plaintiff in the suit is claiming in consortium with <ORG> a sum of Rs The respondents are <ORG> the creditors who filed the winding up petition on against the appellant in <ORG> Civil Appeal arising out of SLP NO is filed by the workmen Engineering Kamgar Sangh against the order dated passed by <ORG> in winding up proceedings confirming the order of the Single Judge appointing provisional Liquidator The appellant company had after taking some adjournments before the Division Bench in the Company Appeal which was filed against the order of the learned Single Judge appointing provisional liquidator submitted a reference before <ORG> hereinafter called the <ORG> on under the Sick Industrial Companies Special Provision Act hereinafter called the Act The said reference was registered as Case No of The point raised in these appeals is that once the reference was registered by the <ORG> on the Division Bench of <ORG> ought not to have passed orders on vacating the interim stay granted by it on and ought not to have confirmed the order of the learned Company Judge dated appointing provisional liquidator in view of the mandate of section of the Act Likewise it is argued that the order of <ORG> dated appointing a Receiver in the interlocutory appeal arising out of the Civil Suit is also had in view of section of the Act Similarly the order of <ORG> in proceedings arising out of winding up proceedings dated vacating the stay and confirming the Company Judges order appointing provisional Liquidator was stayed on in SLP and it was further ordered that the provisional Liquidator shall not take any further steps One other important fact to be noted is that on in SLP this Court passed an order after hearing both sides adjourning the SLPs to enable the <ORG> to come to a decision This Court however directed the appellant <ORG> not to dispose of or alienate or create any third party interests in any of the assets of the <ORG> except with the previous approval of the <ORG> and that before passing any orders the <ORG> will give hearing to <ORG> This Court also recorded an assertion by the <ORG> that the Receiver had taken formal possession of the properties This Court also noticed that <ORG> had in its order dated accepted as true the serious allegations made by <ORG> against the appellant <ORG> At this stage it is necessary to refer to the conduct of the Company already adverted to which came up for severe criticism by <ORG> in its order dated What happened was that after securing a stay order from <ORG> on in respect of the order of the learned Single Judge appointing a provisional Liquidator the Company obtained adjournments before <ORG> on On the case was adjourned to when an affidavit was filed without disclosing that the Company had approached the <ORG> on and the matter was got adjourned to and again to The Bench referred to section and section of the Act and felt that the mere registration of the reference under Section did not amount to pendency of any inquiry under Section and that therefore section was not attracted and therefore the Bench was well within its powers in vacating the stay and confirming the appointment of provisional liquidator or in appointing a Receiver in preference to the Judgments of other High Courts which had taken a contrary view with a view to show that it was a viable unit and to show that it was not liable to be wound up It also issued a contempt notice to the officers of the Company It is necessary to refer to certain subsequent events which have since taken place after the orders under appeal were passed by <ORG> i On the <ORG> passed orders after hearing the representatives of the appellant <ORG> and <ORG> and the <ORG> which was also to get around Rs ii On the <ORG> passed orders recording that the <ORG> had submitted a report and that on that basis and on the basis of the submissions made the <ORG> was to be declared as a sick industry under section read with section of the Act It then said that it is necessary in the public interest to adopt the measures specified in Sections and of the Act in relation to the <ORG> nor confirmed the appointment of provisional Liquidator dated by its order dated when by that date Section of the Act had come into play on account of the registration of the reference dated by the <ORG> on It was contended that the appeals should therefore be allowed and the impugned orders vacated in view of the mandate under Section It was argued that now the matters have reached the stage of section of the Act before the <ORG> and therefore no orders can be passed restoring the Receiver or the provisional liquidator It was also brought to our notice that <ORG> had dropped the contempt proceedings by its order dated pursuant to the apology tendered It took adjournments before <ORG> without informing the Court that it was either approaching or that it had approached the <ORG> and got its reference registered On the basis of the above contentions the following points arise for consideration Could it be said that the conduct of the appellant Company before <ORG> on account of the contrary pleas taken by it before <ORG> and the <ORG> and on account of the suppression of facts would render the reference under section and the registration of the reference and the subsequent orders of the <ORG> bad Whether once the <ORG> had registered the reference dated on under section of the Act read with the Regulations it was permissible for <ORG> of <ORG> to pass orders on vacating the stay order dated and confirming the appointment of provisional liquidator on the company side and also whether it was permissible for <ORG> of the High court to appoint a Receiver on in the proceedings arising out of the suit in view of section of the Act Point It is true that in the winding up proceedings and in the civil suit the appellant company contended that it was a viable unit and that neither a Receiver nor a provisional liquidator could be appointed It is also true that in the affidavit filed on its behalf in <ORG> on seeking an adjournment it had not disclosed to <ORG> that it had moved the <ORG> on In our view there was a clear attempt to keep the <ORG> in the dark So far as the <ORG> was concerned there was no suppression of facts before it We therefore cannot accept the contention of the respondents that the reference under section of the Act and the registration thereof by the <ORG> became bad because of any conduct of the <ORG> before <ORG> It follows that equally the subsequent orders passed by the <ORG> on the reference cannot on that account be said to be invalid We shall therefore refer to the relevant provisions of the Act and Regulations and the headings of the Chapters in the Act and the headings of the Chapters in the Regulations Chapter III of the Act contains section to section A and bears the heading Reference Inquiries and Schemes Section deals with Powers of Board to make suitable orders on the completion of inquiry to the company so as to make its net worth exceed its accumulated losses within a reasonable time or to direct the operating agency to prepare a scheme in the manner provided in section Section refers to the winding up of the industrial unit if it is not likely that the Company will be able to make its net worth exceed its accumulated losses The point which has in this context been raised in several <ORG> is that the mere registration of a reference by the <ORG> under the Act would not result in the automatic cessation of all proceedings which are pending either in civil courts or in <ORG> etc It is argued that in order that section of the Act can come into operation the <ORG> must subsequent to the registration of the reference under section apply its mind and consider it necessary under section to make an inquiry and issue notices on the reference to the affected parties who are required to be heard and that only then it can be said that an inquiry is pending Inquiry into working of sick industrial companies The Board may make such inquiry as it may deem fit for determining whether any industrial company has become a sick industrial company a upon receipt of a reference with respect to such company under Section or Upon information received with respect to such company or upon its own knowledge as to the financial condition of the company The Board may if it deems necessary or expedient so to do for the expeditious disposal of an inquiry under sub section require by order any operating agency to enquire into and make a report with respect to such matters as may be specified in the order The <ORG> or as the case may be the operating agency shall complete its inquiry as expeditiously as possible and endeavour shall be made to complete the inquiry within sixty days from the commencement of the inquiry Where the Board deems it fit to make an inquiry or to cause an inquiry to be made into any industrial company under sub section or as the case may be under sub section it may appoint one or more persons to be a special director or special directors of the company for safeguarding the financial and other interests of the company or in the public interest Where in respect of an industrial company an inquiry under Section is pending or any scheme referred to under Section is under preparation or consideration or a sanctioned scheme is under implementation or where an appeal under section relating to an industrial company is pending then notwithstanding anything contained in the Companies Act or any other law or the memorandum and articles of association of the industrial company or any other instrument having effect under the said Act or other law no proceedings for the winding up of the industrial company or for execution distress or the like against any of the properties of the industrial company or for the appointment of a receiver in respect thereof and no suit for the recovery of money or for the enforcement of any security against the industrial company or of any guarantee in respect of any loans or advance granted to the industrial company shall lie or be proceeded with further except with the consent of the <ORG> or as the case may be <ORG> no proceedings for the winding up of the company or for execution or distress or the like against the property of the company or for the appointment of a receiver and no suit for recovery of money or enforcement of any security or of any guarantee shall lie or be proceeded with further except with the consent of the <ORG> or as the case may be by the appellate authority It is also to be noticed that sub clause of section says that the <ORG> may make such inquiry as it may deem fit for determining whether any industrial company has become a sick industrial unit a upon receipt of a reference under section or upon information received by it or upon its own knowledge as to the financial condition of the company Relying on the use of the word may in section of the Act it has been contended in some High Courts that the word may in that section shows that the <ORG> has power to reject a reference summarily without going into merits and that it is only when the <ORG> takes up the reference for consideration on merits under section that it can be said that the inquiry as contemplated by section has commenced This contention in our opinion has no merit In our view when section says that the <ORG> can conduct the inquiry in such manner as it may deem fit the said words are intended only to convey that a wide discretion is vested in the <ORG> in regard to the procedure it may follow for conducting an inquiry under section and nothing more In fact Once the reference is registered after scrutiny it is in our view mandatory for the <ORG> to conduct an inquiry It is also the legislative intention to see that no proceedings against the assets are taken before any such decision is given by the <ORG> for in the case the <ORG> assets are sold or the company wound up it may indeed become difficult later to restore the status quo ante Chapter II of the Regulations framed under section of the Act bears the heading Reference under section and contains Regulation Chapter III deals with General provisions regarding Inquiries and contains Regulation while Chapter IV which bears the heading Inquiry under section contains Regulations to Chapter deals with proceedings under section and contains Regulation The Division Bench of <ORG> in Bengal Lamps Ltd Case supra which case has been relied upon by <ORG> in the impugned order dated has held that at the stage of registration of the Reference under section of the Act read with Regulation in Chapter II of the Regulations which refers only to section there can be no question of commencement of any inquiry referable to section of the Act Such an inquiry can be treated as having commenced only at the stage of section read with Regulation in Chapter IV of the Regulations which refers to section On that reasoning it held that there can be stay as contemplated by section only when section stage of inquiry has arrived and not at the stage of section dealing with registration of the reference The effect of the amended Regulation is that even before any Bench of the <ORG> can think of calling for information under Regulation or under Regulation read with section it is now mandatory after the amendment that as soon as a reference is registered information documents shall be called for from the informant straightaway The point is whether when such information documents are required to be simultaneously called for at Regulation stage can it be said that an inquiry under section has commenced The above question depends upon what is meant by the word inquiry used in section of the Act Section and the prohibitions contained in it shall immediately come into play In that view of the matter we need not go into the correctness of the view expressed by the Calcutta Rajasthan and Bombay <ORG> which relied upon the unamended Regulation On the facts of this case the impugned orders dated and of <ORG> have been passed after the BIFR proceedings reached the stage of second part of Regulation on that is to say when proceedings as per the amended Regulation reached the stage of inquiry under section It must therefore be deemed that the said orders are illegal and are in violation of the prohibition contained in section of the Act For the aforesaid reasons the order passed by the Division Bench on appointing Receiver and the order passed by another Bench of <ORG> on restoring the provisional liquidator are set aside The respondents are free if need be to approach the <ORG> under section and section A of the Act for further orders if any in addition to the orders already passed by the <ORG> in this behalf
