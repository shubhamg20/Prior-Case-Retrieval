The President of India promulgated an Ordinance called the Central Excises and Salt and Additional Duties of Excise Amendment Ordinance which was later replaced by Central Act VI of called the Central Excises and Salt and Additional Duties of Excise Amendment Act Similar amendments were made in items and of the First Schedule with retrospective effect Section of the Amending Act provided that no suit or other proceedings shall be maintained or continued in any other Court for the refund of the duty collected and no enforcement shall be made by any Court of any decree or order directing the refund of such duties of excise which have been collected and which may have been collected as if the provisions of Section of the Act had been in force on and from the appointed day as defined in the Act <ORG> held that cotton fabric subjected to bleaching dyeing and printing could not be subjected to excise duty under items and of the First Schedule to the Central Excises and Salt Act and that processors were liable to pay duties under tariff entry only on the value added by that processor However <ORG> took a different view and held that even under the concept of manufacture envisaged in section even prior to its amendment the operations carried on by the professors amounted to manufacture and that at all events the matter was placed beyond any controversy by the Amendment Act of The present appeals by special leave preferred against the judgments of <ORG> of Gujarat and <ORG> of Bombay and the batch of writ petitions under Article of the Constitution of India involve common PG NO questions of law concerning the validity of the levy of duties of excise under tariff items and of the Schedule to the Central Excises and Salt Act Central Excise Act as amended by the Central Excises and Salt Additional Duties Excise Amendment Act Amending Act treating as manufacture the process of bleaching dyeing printing sizing mercerising water proofing rubberising shrink proofing organdie processing etc done by the processors who carry out these operations in their factories on job work basis in respect of cotton fabric and Man made fabric belonging to their customers At the time of hearing the correctness of the view taken in the <ORG> case on certain aspects having been doubted by another Bench of this Court these appeals writ petitions were referred to a Bench of five judges on two questions namely whether the processing of grey fabric amounted to manufacture within the meaning of Section as it stood prior to its amendment and whether even if such processing did amount to manufacture what should be the proper basis for determining the assessable value of the processed fabrics In the petitions and appeals the following points arise for determination PG NO A i Whether the process of bleaching dyeing printing sizing shrink proofing etc Whether the amendment brought about by the Act of of Section and to tariff items and of the Central Excise Act is ultra vires Entry List and therefore beyond the competence of <ORG> Whether at all events even if the amendments to Central Excise Act are valid the levy under the Additional Duties Act is unsupportable and without the authority of law as there is no corresponding enlargement of the definition of manufacture under the Additional Duties Act Allowing the appeals preferred by <ORG> HELD Per Majority The appeals preferred by <ORG> are allowed and the Judgment of <ORG> under appeal is PG NO set aside The circumstances that thereby the benefit of any computation granted by the legislation may be lost and that in some cases hardship might result are not matters which would influence courts on the Instruction of the statute A tax payer is entitled only to such benefit as is granted by the legislature i Where a manufacturer sells the goods manufactured by him in wholesale to a wholesale dealer at the arms length and in the usual course of business the wholesale cash price charged by him to the wholesale dealer less trade discount would represent the value of the goods for the purpose of assessment of excise But the price received by he wholesale dealer who purchases the goods from the manufacturer and in his turn sells the same in wholesale to other dealers would be irrelevant for determination of the value of the goods and the goods would be charged on that basis A iii The assessable value would therefore include the value of the grey cloth in the hands of the processors plus the value of the job work done plus manufacturing profits and manufacturing expenses whatever would be included in the price at the factory gate The correct assessable value must be the value of the fabric at the factory gate that is to say the value at which the manufactured goods leave the factory and enter the main stream It is there fore necessary to reiterate that the value for the assessment under Section of the Act will not be the processing charge along but the intrinsic value of the processed fabric which is the price at which the fabrics are sold for the first time in the wholesale market Per <NAME> for himself and on behalf of <NAME> and <NAME> i The prevalent and generally accepted test to ascertain that there is manufacture is whether the change or the series of changes brought about by the application of processes take the commodity to the point where commercially it can no longer be regarded as the original commodity but is instead recognised as a distinct and new article that has emerged as a result of the processes ii The view taken in the Empire Industries case that grey fabrics after they undergo the various processes of bleaching dyeing sizing printing finishing etc emerges as a commercially different commodity with its own price structure custom and other commercial incidents and that there was in that sense a manufacture within the meaning of Section even as unamended is an eminently plausible view and is not shown to suffer from any fallacy are not sources of the legislative power but are merely topics or fields of legislation and must receive a liberal construction inspired by a broad and generous spirit and not in a narrow pedantic sense In defending the validity of a law questioned on ground of legislative incompetence the <ORG> can always show that the law was supportable under any other entry within the competence of the legislature <ORG> has exclusive power to legislate upon that topic or field Of course it has concurrent power also in respect of the subjects in List iv Even if the impost on process is not one under Entry List but Is an impost of processing distinct from manufacture the levy could yet be supported by Entry List even without the aid of the wider principle recognised and adopted in <NAME> case AIR SC Section of the Amending Act VI of has amended the relevant items in the schedule to the Additional Duties Act the expressions produce or manufacture in Section of the Additional Duties Act must be read along with the entries in the Schedules i A Competent legislature can always validate a law which has been declared by court to be invalid provided the infirmities and vitiating factors noticed in the declaratory judgment are removed for cured iii In testing whether a retrospective imposition of a tax operates so harshly as to violate fundamental rights under article the factors considered relevant include the context in which retroactivity was contemplated such as whether the law is one of validation of taxing statute struck down by courts for certain defects the period of such retroactivity and the decree and extent of any unforeseen or unforeseenable financial burden imposed for the past period etc i Section of the Central Excise Act envisages that the value of an article for the purposes of duty shall be deemed to be a the wholesale cash price for which an article of the like kind and quality was sold or was capable of being sold at the time of removal of the article from the factory or premises of manufacture for delivery at the place of manufactures or where such price was not ascertainable the price at which an article of the like kind and quality as sold or capable of being sold al the time of removal of the article chargeable with duty ii Consistent with the provisions of Section and the Central Excise Valuation Rules framed under sec The view taken in the matter in <ORG> case does not call for reconsideration The standard adopted as the measure of assessment may throw light on the nature of the levy but is not determinative of it When a statutory measure for assessment of the tax is contemplated it need not contour along the lines which spell out the levy itself and a broader based standard of reference may be adopted for the purposes of determining the measure of the levy Any statutory standard which maintains a nexus with the essential character of the levy can be regarded as a valid basis for assessing the measure of the tax It was considered not necessary or possible to stretch the language of the definition in beyond the ambit of the provision as delineated in the earlier decisions ii There is nothing in the decision HMM case that supports the contention of the petitioners here that the amendment of the definition of manufacture cannot be sustained by reference to entry of List in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India if it cannot be upheld as falling under the purview of Entry It is an expression of wide import and takes in all the stages of charge quantification and recovery of duty though in certain contexts it may have a restricted meaning The words levy and collection in sub section cannot be construed differently from the words levied and collected used in sub section ii Having regard to the nature and content of the levy indicated in it is obvious that has to have the effect of attracting not only the purely procedural and machinery provisions of the Act but also some of its charging provisions In short the language of has to be given a wider meaning than under the Finance Act i Legislatures sometimes take a short cut and try to reduce the length of statutes by omitting elaborate provisions where such provisions have already been enacted earlier and can be adopted for the purpose on hand In this event the provisions of the earlier Act or those so incorporated as they stand in the earlier Act at the time of incorporation will be read into the later Act It may only make a reference of a broad nature as to the law on the subject generally or contain a general reference to the terms of an earlier statute which are to be made applicable iii Whether a particular statute falls into the first or second category is always a question of construction In the present case the legislation falls into the second category While the Act imposes a general levy of excise duty on all goods manufactured and produced and aim of the present Act is to supplement the levy by an additional duty of the same nature on certain goods The following Judgments of the Court were delivered <NAME> These appeals by Special Leave preferred against the Judgments of <ORG> and <ORG> and the batch of writ petitions under Article of the Constitution of India are heard together and disposed of by this common judgment as they all involve questions common to them concerning the validity of the levy of duties of excise under tariff items and of the Schedule to the Central Excises and Salt Act Central Excise Act as amended by the Central Excise and Salt Additional Duties Excise Amendment Act Amending Act treating as Manufacture the process of Bleaching Dyeing Printing Sizing Mercerising water proofing rubberising Shrink Proofing Organdie Processing etc done by the processor who carry out these operations in their factories on Job work basis in respect of Cotton fabric and Man made fabric belonging to their customers The Amending Act which became effective from sought to render the processes of Bleaching Dyeing Printing Sizing Mercerising etc Manufacture within the meaning of the Section of the Central Excise Act The amendment was necessitated by the Judgment of <ORG> which has declared the levy on such processing as illegal as according to <ORG> the processing did not bring into being a new and commercially different article with a distinctive character and use and did not therefore constitute manufacture for purposes and within the meaning of the charging section The processors who carry out these operations on cotton fabrics or man made fabrics which are popularly go by the name Grey fabric in the particular trade also challenged the levy of the additional duties of excise under the provisions of the additional Duties of Excise goods of special importance Act Additional Duties Act on the ground first that if the processes carried on by them do not amount to manufacture under Section as it originally stood then consistent with the impermissibility of main impost The facts of No in which the petitioner has challenged the levy by a petition under Article of the Constitution are typical and representative of all other similar cases The petitioner is a firm of partners with its Head Office at Sheikh Memon Street Bombay It has a factory at Sunder Baug Deonar Bombay which is equipped with machinery and plants for processing of man made grey fabric The machinery and equipment installed in the petitioners factory it is averred and that is not disputed either are suited for and appropriate to the processing of Grey fabric and are not capable of manufacturing Grey fabric The man made grey fabric such as Art Silk Grey fabric it is stated is manufactured in mills and on power looms and that letter is exempt from excise duty on its manufacture Petitioners further over that the Art Silk Grey fabrics which are processed in the petitioner factory are those manufactured on power looms and not by the mills and that the Art Silk Grey fabric received do not come from the manufacturers of the grey fabric through the manufacturing stream but from the various traders through the sales stream It is also averred that the firm <ORG> does not purchase <ORG> but is only engaged in processing it for charges and that in many cases <ORG> would have passed on from trader to trader with the attendant increase in the prices with each successive change of hands and is entrusted to the petitioner by the last purchaser for processing against stipulated processing charges on job work basis It is contended that these job work processing operations do not amount to manufacture as the petitioners do not carry out any spinning or weaving operations that what they receive from their customers for processing is PG NO therwise fully manufactured man made fabric and that what is returned to the customers after processing continues to remain man made fabric The essential question is whether these situational differences have a bearing on the principles of determination of the assessable value of processed grey fabric and whether the assessable value could be different in the different fact situations which would be the logical corollary if the contention of the processing houses which do not processing work for charges on the goods not their own is accepted and the assessable value determined on the basis of mere processing charges But the main questions that arise are whether processing of the kind concerned in these cases amounts to manufacture whether the provisions of section of the Amending Act which impart an artificial dimension to the concept of manufacture is ultra vires Entry List whether at all events the imposition of a tax on such processing is referable to Entry List and if the import on the processors is justified under tariff items and according as whether the Grey fabric is cotton or man made what should be the assessable value for purposes of levy of duty so far as processors are concerned took a view different from the one that commended itself to <ORG> <ORG> held that even under the concept of manufacture envisaged in Section even prior to its amendment the operations carried on by the processors amounted to manufacture and that at all events the matter was placed beyond any controversy by the mending Act i Act of Some of the processors have as stated earlier filed writ petitions under Article directly in this court challenging the impost on grounds that commended themselves for acceptance to <ORG> Before its amendment by the Amending Act Central Act VI of Section of the Central Excise ACt defined manufacture in its well accepted legal sense nomen juris and not with reference to an artificial and statutorily expanded import manufacture includes any process incidental or ancillary to the completion of a manufactured product and i ii Omitted as unnecessary The reasoning of <ORG> was on these lines In the instant case the excise duty claimed on the basis of the market value of the processed cotton fabrics or manmade fabrics cannot be levied because assuming that process amounts to manufacture all that they have done is to manufacture processed cloth processed fabric either cotton or man made and that not being a taxable event in the light of Section read with section of the Act and PG NO Items and levy of excise duty on this basis was ultra vires and contrary to law Accordingly the President of India promulgated an Ordinance called the Central Excise and Salt and Additional Duties of Excise Amendment Ordinance Central Ordinance No of sub

have been collected and which would have been validly collected if the provisions of this section had been in force on and from the appointed day The pronouncement of this court in <ORG> case otherwise covers and is a full answer to the contentions raised in this batch of cases However the correctness of the view taken in the <ORG> case on certain aspects was doubted by another Bench of this court and the matter was accordingly referred to a Bench of five judges It is perhaps necessary to refer to the order dated made by <ORG> referring the cases to a larger bench The first was whether the processing of Grey fabric amounted to manufacture within the meaning of Section as it stood prior to its amendment The second question was whether even if such processing did amount to manufacture what should he the proper basis for determining the assessable value of the processed fabrics <ORG> did not disagree with the decision in <ORG> case on the question whether processing did amount to manufacture Indeed <ORG> appears to have proceeded on the premise that the view taken in <ORG> case on the point was the correct one carried out by the processors on job work basis amount to manufacture both under the Act as it stood prior to the amendment as also under the Act subsequent to the amendment and the processed fabrics are liable to be assessed to excise duty in the hands of what may be called jobbers Since this was a decision given by a Bench of three Judges the petitioners and appellants who are carrying on business of processing on job work basis could not contend that these PG NO processes do not amount to manufacture and that the processed fabrics are not liable to be assessed to excise duty in the hands of the jobbers But it was the second question which provoked serious controversy before us se writ petitions and appeals are referred to the larger Bench it will be open to the larger Bench to consider not only the question of determination of the assessable value but also the other question namely whether processing of grey fabric by a processor on job work basis constitutes manufacture because the judgment in <ORG> case which has decided this question in favor of the revenue and against the processor is a judgment of a Bench of only three Judges and now the present writ petitions and appeals will be heard by a Bench of five Judges This is how the first question which is otherwise concluded by the pronouncement in <ORG> case is sought to be reagitated before us Out of deference to the learned counsel who vigorously argued this aspect at great length and we though we should examine the submission on this point also though the matter could by no means be considered to have been referred to a larger bench It contemplated the alternative possibilities of valuation thus It was common ground between the parties that the procedure followed by the <ORG> authorities was that the trader who entrusted cotton or man made fabrics to the processor for processing on job work basis would give a declaration to the processor as to what would be the price at which he would be selling the processed goods in the market and that would be taken by the <ORG> authorities as the assessable value of the processed fabrics and excise duty would be charged to the processor on that basis This may be illustrated by giving the following example PG NO i Value of grey cloth in the hands of the processor Rs Rs The assessable value in the case given in this example would be taken by the Excise authorities at Rs which was the sale price of the trader The view of the Referring Bench on the point was this We cannot accept the contention of the learned counsel on behalf of the petitioners and the appellants that the value of the grey cloth which is processed by the processor should not be included in the assessable value of the processed fabric since the grey cloth is one of the raw materials which goes into the manufacture of the processed fabric and the value of the processed fabric cannot be computed without including the value of the raw material That goes into its manufacture The assessable value of the processes fabric cannot therefore be limited merely to the value of the job work done but it must be determined by reference to the wholesale cash price of the processed fabric gate of the factory of the processor and the profit of Rs which the trader may make by selling the processed fabric cannot be included in the assessable value The element of selling profit of the trader would be entirely an extraneous element and it cannot be taken into account for the purpose of determining the assessable value of the processee fabric which would comprise the value of the grey cloth and the PG NO job work charges but exclude the profit at which the trader may sub sequently sell the processed fabric We have heard <NAME> <NAME> Dr <NAME> and <NAME> learned Senior Advocates in the appeals and writ petitions preferred by the processors and <NAME> learned Attorney General and <NAME> learned Senior Advocate for <ORG> and its authorities On the contentions urged the points that fall for determination are a i Whether the processes of Bleaching Dyeing Printing Sizing Shrink proofing etc Whether the amendment brought about by the Amending Act of of Section and to tariff items and of the Central Excise Act is ultra vires Entry List I and therefore beyond the competence of <ORG> Whether at all events even if the expanded concept of manufacture introduced by the Amendment is beyond the scope of Entry List whether the impost is at all events referable to and supportable by the residual Entry of List I Whether at all events even if the amendments to Central Excise Act are valid the levy under the Additional Duties Act is unsupportable and without the authority of law as there is no corresponding enlargement of the definition of manufacture under the Additional Duties Act Re Contention a The essential condition to be satisfied to justify the levies contend counsel is that there should be manufacture of goods and in order that the concept of manufacture in Entry List I is satisfied there should come into existence a new article with a distinctive character and use as a result of the processing It is contended that nothing of the kind happens when Grey fabric is processed it remains grey fabric no new article with any distinctive character emerges the raw material undergoes some change To say this is to equate processing to manufacture and for this we can find no warrant in law The word manufacture used as a verb is generally understood to mean as bringing into existence a new substance and does not mean merely to produce some change in a substance <NAME> Director of <ORG> which were referred to with approval by this Court in the case of <ORG> supra was relied upon At some point processing and manufacturing will merge But where the commodity retains a continuing substantial identity through the processing stage we cannot say that it has been manufactured manufacture is the end result of one or more processes through which the original commodity is made to pass Where there is no essential difference in identity between the original commodity and the processed article it is not possible to say that in one commodity has been consumed in the manufacture of another Although it has undergone a degree of processing it MUSt be regarded as still retaining its original identity STC made while repelling the contention of the revenue urged in that case that when cloth is printed and coloured it gets transformed to sorne other material and that therefore when such printed and coloured cloth is exported what was exported was not the same cloth and that by such printing and dyeing the original cloth got transformed into different material were relied on The cloth exported is the same as the cloth sold with this variation or difference that the colour has change by printing and processing In view which we take the cloth exported is the same as the cloth sold by the petitioners there can be no question above the exemption clause not applying to it Emphasis Supplied The following passage in the permanent Edition of Words and Phrases referred to with approval in <ORG> AIR SCp But something more is necessary and there must be transformation a new and different article must emerge having a distinctive name character or use Further learned counsel placed reliance upon <ORG> case where it was held that ground nut oil after the process of hydrogenation which improved its keeping qualities and shelf life yet remained basically ground nut oil and that the quality of the oil had been improved by the processes it was subjected to did not detract from its continuing identity as ground nut oil The change brought about in the oil it was observed by this Court rendered it more acceptable to the customers by improving its quality but did not render the oil a commodity other than ground oil which still continued to be groundnut oil notwithstanding the processing which was merely for the purpose of rendering the oil more stable thus improving its keeping qualities for those who desire to consume ground nut oil It was also urged that the affidavits filed by person engaged in and familiar with the textile trade indicated that the finished fabric was not a commercially different commodity We have carefully considered these submissions The decsion of <ORG> might perhaps be justified on the ground that a printed or dyed cloth is commercially different article from the cloth which is purchased and printed or dyed It was contended that processing the manufactured fabric does not bring into existence any new woven material but the question is does new and different goods emerge having distinctive name use and character Answering the Bench said It appears in the light of the several decisions and on the construction of the expression that the process of bleaching dyeing and printing etymologically also means manufacturing processes It is strenuously urged for the processors that the view taken by <ORG> in the <ORG> case suffers from fallacies both of reasoning and conclusion and requires to be reconsidered The prevalent and generally accepted test to ascertain that there is manufacture is whether the change or the series of changes brought about by the application of processes take the commodity to the point where commercially it can no longer be regarded as the original commodity but is instead recognised as a distinct and new article that has emerged as a result of the processes But difficulties arise in their application in individual cases The correctness of the view in the <ORG> case cannot be tested in the light of material in the form of affidavit expressing the opinion of persons said to be engaged in or connected with the textile trade as to the commercial identity of the commodities before and after the processing placed before the court in a sub sequent case These opinions are of course relevant and would be amongst the various factors to be taken into account in deciding the question On a consideration of the matter we are persuaded to think that the view taken in the <ORG> case that Grey fabric after they undergo the various processes of bleaching dyeing sizing printing finishing etc emerges as a commercially different commodity with its own price structure custom and other commercial incidents and that there was in that sense a manufacture within the meaning of Section even as unamended is an eminently plausible view and is not shown to suffer from any fallacy We think we should reject Contention a we have on the one hand to bear in mind the salutary rule that words conferring the right of legislation should be interpreted liberally and the powers conferred should be given the widest amplitude on the other hand we have to guard ourselves against extending the meaning of the words beyond their reasonable connotation in an anxiety to preserve the power of the legislature Emphasis supplied Though entries in the legislative lists are to be construed liberally and the widest possible amplitude given to them however no artificial or arbitrary extensions of the meaning of the words in the entry There is in law no manufacture unless as a result of the process a new and commercially distinct product with distinct use emerges In <ORG> case a similar argument was urged but without success Learned Judges were persuaded to the view that such processes which were referred to by the amendment were not so alien or foreign to the concept of manufacture that they could not come within that concept Entries to the legislative lists it must be recalled are not sources of the legislative power but are merely topics or fields of legislation and must receive a liberal construction inspired by a broad and generous spirit and not in a narrow pedantic sense In <ORG> case it was held As has been noted processes of the type which have been incorporated by the impugned Act were not so alien or foreign to the concept of manufacture that these could not come within that concept List even without the aid of the wider principle recognised and adopted in <NAME> case AIR SC It was then argued that if the legislation was sought to be defended on the ground that it is a tax on activity like processing and would be covered by the powers enumerated under Entry of List I of the Seventh Schedule PG NO then it was submitted that there was no charging section for such an activity and as such the charge must fail and there cannot be any levy The contention was rejected holding This argument proceeds on an entire misconception It stipulates the levy and charge of duty of excise on all excisable goods produced or manufactured Manufactured under the Act after the amendment would be the manufacture as amended in section and Tariff item I and and the charge would be on that basis Therefore it is difficult to appreciate the argument that the levy would fail as there will be no appropriate charging section or machinery for effectuating the levy on the activity like the method of processing even if such an activity can be justified under Entry of List of Seventh Schedule We are therefore of the opinion that there is no substance in this contention We respectfully agree It is not necessary for the <ORG> to show that the legislature in enacting the law consciously applied its mind to the source of its own competence In defending the validity of a law questioned on ground of legislative incompetence the <ORG> can always show that the law was supportable under any othe entry within the competence of the legislature It is divided into Parts dealing respectively with customs and excise duty value added tax income tax capital gains tax stamp duty capital transfer tax and so on There is no prohibition against the <ORG> enacting in a single statute matters which call for the exercise of power under two or more entries in List I of the Seventh Schedule Illustrations of such legislation are not wanting in our statute book and the fact that one of such entries is the residuary entry does not also attract any disability If it is not it is not necessary to go any further or search for the field in List I <ORG> has exclusive power to legislate upon that topic or field Of course it has concurrent power also in respect of the subjects in List III The contention proceeds on the pre supposition that processing does not amount to manufacture under Section of the Additional Duties Act It would be a new terror in the construction Acts of Parliament if we were required to limit a word to an unnatural sense because in some Act which is not incorporated or referred to such an interpretation is given to it for the purposes of that Act alone It was also urged that Section of the Additional Duties Act which provides that the provisions of Central Excise Act and the rules made thereunder shall so far as may be apply in relation to the levy and collection of the Additional Duties would not also enable the wider definition of manufacture in Section to be imported into Section of the Additional Duties Act to justify levy of Additional Duties on processing There are at least two circumstances which render the definition of manufacture under Section attracted to the additional levies Ievy and collection of the additional duties as they apply in relation to the levy and collection of the duties of excise on the goods specified in sub section It is plain that the statute expressly makes the provision in the Central Excise Act apply in relation to levy and collection of the additional duties It includes both imposition of a tax as well as its quantification and assessment The term imposition is generally used for the levy of a tax or duty by legislative provision indicating the subject matter of the tax and the rates at which it has to he taxed That apart Section of Amending Act VI of has amended the relevant items in the schedule to the Additional Duties Act therefore clear is that what applies to the main levy applies to the additional duties as well we find no substance in Contention either Re Contention There is really no substance in the grievance that the retroactivity imparted to the amendments is violative of Article A Competent legislature can always validate a law which has been declared by courts to be invalid provided the infirmities and vitiating infactors noticed in the declaratory judgment are removed or cured not only because of the paramount governmental interest in obtaining adequate revenues but also because taxes are not in the nature of a penalty or a contractual obligation but rather a means of apportioning the costs of government amongst those who benefit from it In testing whether a retrospective imposition of a tax operates so harshly as to violate fundamental rights under Article the factors considered relevant include the context in which retroactivity was contemplated such as whether the law is one of validation of taxing statute struck down by courts for certain defects the period of such retroactivity and the degree and extent of any unforeseen or unforseable financial burden imposed for the past period etc There is no merit in contention either Re Contention This concerns the question of the correctness of the determination of the assessable value The processors say that they have filed classification lists under rule PG NO of the Central Excises and Salt Rules as they had no other choice and that if the proper principles of determination of the assessable value do not legally justify the consequences flowing from the classification it is open to them to contend against the validity of the determination and they are not estopped from doing so The processors contend that the assessable value could only be the job work charges received by them for the processing of Grey fabric and cannot be the selling price at which the customer who entrusts the Grey fabric for processing ultimately sells it in the market The determination of assessable value at the actual or hypothetical selling price of goods of like nature and quality in the wholesale market would include the post manufacturing profits of the trader which cannot legitimately be regarded as part of the assessable value SCR at wherein it was held When the textile fabrics are subjected to the processes like bleaching dyeing and printing etc by independent processes whether on their own account or on job charges basis the value of the purposes of assessment under section of the Central Excise Act will not be the processing charges alone but the intrinsic value of the processed fabrics which is the price at which such fabrics are sold PG NO for the first time in the wholesale market The value would naturally include the value of grey fabrics supplied to the independent processors for the processing However excise duty if any paid on the grey fabrics will be given pro forma credit to the independent processors to be utilised for the payment on the processed fabrics in accordance with the Rules A or of the Central Excise Rules as the case may be <ORG> held We cannot accept the contention of the learned counsel on behalf of the petitioners and the appellants that the value of the grey cloth which is processed by the processor should not be included in the assessable value of the processed fabric In the argument as presented that the assessable value would include what is referred to as the post manufacture profits there is an obvious fallacy SCR <NAME> speaking for the Court said The value of the goods for the purpose of excise must take into account only the manufacturing cost and the manufacturing profit and it must not be loaded with post manufacturing cost or profit arising from post manufacturing operation It may be noted that wholesale market in a particular type of goods may be in several tiers and the goods may reach the consumer after a series of wholesale transactions If excise were levied on the basis of second or subsequent wholesale price it would load the price with a post manufacturing element namely selling cost and selling profit of the wholesale dealer Secondly this would also violate the concept of the factory gate sale which is the basis of determination of value of the goods for the purpose of excise There can therefore be no doubt that where a manufacturer sells the goods manufactured by him in wholesale to a wholesale dealer at arms length and in the usual course of business the wholesale cash price charged by him to the wholesale dealer less trade discount would represent the value of the goods for the purpose of assessment of excise Explaining what really is the idea of post manufacturing profit referred to in <ORG> case this court in <ORG> etc When it refers to post manufacturing expenses and post manufacturing profit arising from post manufacturing operations it clearly intends to refer not to the expenses and profits pertaining to the sale transactions effected by the manufacturer but to those pertaining to the subsequent sale transactions effected by the wholesale buyers in favour of other dealers Emphasis Supplied The principles for the determination of assessable value are laid down under section of the Act Section of the Central Excise Act envisages that the value of an article for the purposes of duty shall be deemed to be a The wholesale cash price for which an article of the like kind and quality was sold or was capable of being sold at the time of removal of the article from the factory or premises of manufacture for delivery at the place of manufacture or Where such price was not ascertainable the price at which an article of the like kind and quality was sold or capable of being sold at the time of removal of the article chargeable with duty The standard adopted as the measure of assessment may throw light on the nature of the levy but is not determinative of it and a broader based standard of reference may be adopted for the purposes of determining the measure of the levy Any statutory standard which maintains a nexus with the essential character of the levy can be regarded as a valid basis for assessing the measure of the tax In the case of processing houses they become liable to pay excise duty not because they are the owners of the goods but because they cause the manufacture of the goods It is to solve the problem arising out of the circumstances that goods owned by one person are manufacture by another that at a certain stage under rule A a notification was issued by <ORG> exempting from the operation of the rule A every manufacturer who gets his goods manufactured on his account from any other person subject to the conditions that the said manufacturer authorises the person who actually manufactures or fabricates the said goods to comply with all procedural formalities under Central Excises and Salt Act of and the rules made thereunder in respect of the goods manufactured on behalf PG NO of the said manufacturer and in order to enable the determination of value of the said goods under section of the said Act to furnish information relating to the price at which the said manufacturer is selling the said goods and the person so authorised agrees to discharge all liabilities under the said Act and the rules made thereunder On a consideration of the matter the view taken in the matter in the <ORG> case does not call for reconsideration In the result the appeals preferred by <ORG> are allowed and the Judgment of <ORG> under appeal is set aside The appeals preferred by the processors against the judgment of <ORG> and the writ petitions filed by the processors directly in this court are dismissed <ORG> and its authorities shall be entitled to recover the amounts due by way of arrears of excise duty and shall be entitled to take necessary steps to seek the enforcement of the bank guarantees if any for the recovery of the arrears <NAME> I have had the advantage of reading in draft the judgment proposed to be delivered by my learned brother <NAME> I respectfully agree with him There is however one aspect of the matter in respect of which I would like to say a few words The processors in the cases before us say that they have filed classification lists under rule of the Central Excises and Salt Rules as they had no other choice and that if the proper principles of determination of the assessable value do not legally justify the consequences flowing from the classification it is open to them to contend against the validity of the determination and they are nOt estopped from doing so Section a of the Act stipulates that the value should be subject to other provisions of the Section the normal price thereof that is to say the price at which such goods are ordinarily sold by the assessee to a buyer in the course of wholesale trade for delivery at the time and place of removal where the buyer PG NO is not a related person and the price is the sole consideration for the sale For the present purpose we are not concerned with the provisos nor the situation where the normal price of goods is not ascertainable for any reason it was held that where for the purpose of calculating assessable value a notional sum is laid down by the legislature to be arrived at one a certain basis it is not permissible for the courts to engraft into it any other deduction or allowance or addition or read it down on the score that unless the said deduction or allowance or addition is authorised elsewhere in the Act or in the Rules The circumstances that thereby the benefit of any exemption granted by the legislation may be lost and that in some cases hardship might result are not matters which would influence courts on the construction of the statute A tax payer is entitled only to such benefit as is granted by the legislature And it was held that there was no hardship in these cases It was further reiterated that when the textile fabrics are subjected to the processes like bleaching dyeing and printing etc by independent processes whether on their own account or on job charges basis the value for the purposes of assessment under section of the Central Excise Act will not be the processing charge alone but the intrinsic value of the processed fabrics which is the price at which such fabrics are sold for the first time in the wholesale market The value would naturally include the value of grey fabrics supplied to the independent processors for the processing However excise duty if any paid on the grey fabrics will be given proforma credit to the independent processors to be utilised for the payment on the processed fabrics in accordance with the relevant rules carried on by a processor on job work basis in respect of grey cotton fabrics and manmade fabrics be<ORG>onging to the customer and entrusted by him for processing amount to manufacture with the meaning of the Act prior to its amendment so as to attract <ORG>evy of excise duty on the processed fabrics and in any event after the Amendment Act these processes amount to manufacture and excise duty is <ORG>eviab<ORG>e on the processed fabrics If the trader who entrusted cotton or man made fabrics to the processor for processing on job work basis wou<ORG>d give a dec<ORG>aration to the processor as to what wou<ORG>d be the price at which he wou<ORG>d be se<ORG><ORG>ing the processed goods in the market that wou<ORG>d be taken by the Excise authorities as the assessab<ORG>e va<ORG>ue of the processed fabrics and excise duty wou<ORG>d be charged to the processor on that basis Where a manufacturer se<ORG><ORG>s the goods manufactured by him in who<ORG>esa<ORG>e to a who<ORG>esa<ORG>e dea<ORG>er at the arms <ORG>ength and in the usua<ORG> course of business the who<ORG>esa<ORG>e cash price charged by him to the who<ORG>esa<ORG>e dea<ORG>er <ORG>ess trade discount wou<ORG>d represent the va<ORG>ue of the goods for the purpose of assessment of excise But the price received by the who<ORG>esa<ORG>e dea<ORG>er who purchases the goods from the manufacturer and in his turn se<ORG><ORG>s the same in who<ORG>esa<ORG>e to other dea<ORG>er wou<ORG>d be irre<ORG>evant for determination of the va<ORG>ue of the goods and the goods wou<ORG>d not be charged on that basis necessary to reiterate that the value for the assessment under section of the Act will not be the processing charge alone but the intrinsic value of the processed fabrics which is the price at which the fabrics are sold for the first time in the wholesale market PG NO RANGANATHAN I agree but I should like to add a few words on two of the points argued before us First I should like to clarify the nature of the decision in <ORG> <ORG> the <ORG> case to which I was a party since learned counsel for the petitioners sought to rely on my judgment in that case as supporting his contention that the <ORG> cannot seek to uphold the amendment presently in question by reference to Entry of List I in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution In that case <ORG> was concerned with the interpretation of the amendment to of the Central Excises and Salt Act by Act of The pre amendment section postulated the determination of excise duty on the basis of the wholesale cash price of the excisable goods at the factory gate and an explanation provided that in determining this price no abatement or deduction shall be allowed in respect of trade discount and the amount of duty payable at the time of the removal of the goods from the factory The question had been answered by several <ORG> in the negative principally on the ground that the duty sought to be levied under the Act was an excise duty the very nature of which required a proximate connection with production or manufacture and that what had passed beyond this region and entered the domain of sale could not pass as excise duty with a view to overcome these decisions had contended that since Entry of List I in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution enabled <ORG> to enact a legislation even beyond the purview of an excise duty covered by Entry of that list the <ORG> should not read into the amended section the limitations that had been considered inherent in the section before its amendment It was in repelling this contention that certain observations were made by me in paras to of the judgment to which Sri <NAME> drew our attention It will however be clear from the discussion in the paragraphs referred to that the contention was repelled not on the ground that the legislature could not make a wider levy by reference to Entry but only on the ground that the history context and language of the amendment did not warrant the wider interpretation that the language of the new section should be given an enlarged scope and interpretation by relating it to Entry of List I of Seventh Schedule cannot in our opinion be accepted We do not think in considering this amendment that it is necessary for us to discuss whether if <ORG> were to enact a law imposing on goods manufactured or produced a duty based not only on the manufacturing cost profits but also including in the dutiable value the whole or some part post manufacturing cost profits such a law would be intra vires or not because it appears to us that no such law has been enacted in this case It was concluded after referring to the previous position as well as the statement of objects and reasons for the amendment that there was nothing to show that the legislature had intended to make ally change and that the rule against a presumption of implicit alteration of the law should be invoked in the context It was considered not necessary or possible to stretch the language of the definition in beyond the ambit of the provision as delineated in the earlier decisions Entry in List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution permits the enactment by <ORG> of a law relating to taxation of income The legislature retained the levy on the basis of the wholesale cash price at the factory gate as before and only introduced a definition of the expression value in terms a little more elaborate but basically not very different from what had been contained in the earlier section If such extended concept is within the range of duties of excise as envisaged under Entry and I agree that with my learned brothers that is there is no difficulty Nevertheless the specific statutory definition cannot be ignored and it it cannot be held valid by reference to Entry its validity has to be considered with reference to the residuary Entry In my view therefore there is nothing in the decision in the <ORG> case that supports the contention of the petitioners have that the amendment of the definition of manufacture cannot be PG NO sustained by reference to Entry of List I in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India if it cannot be upheld as falling under the purview of Entry The argument is in three phases and runs thus i of the Act which is the charging section fastens the charge of duty at the state of manufacture out this expression is deliberately left undefined though the statute takes special care in to adopt for its purposes the definition of the specified goods as contained in the Act there is no warrant or justification for giving such a narrow interpretation to the wide language of of the Act Learned counsel for the petitioner in advancing this argument apparently has in mind the famous dictum of Lord <NAME> in <NAME> <ORG> A echoed in several decisions of this Court and of the various <ORG> in India PG NO Now there are three stages in the imposition of a tax there is the declaration of liability that is the part of the statute which determines what persons in respect of what property are liable Next there is the assessment Liability does not depend on assessment I do not see any force in this argument One can say with as much appropriateness that the Income tax Act levies a tax on income as that the the Income Tax Officer levies the tax in accordance with the provisions of the Act It is an expression of wide import and takes in all the stages of charge quantification and recovery of duty though in certain contexts it may have a restricted meaning The words levy and collection in sub section cannot be construed differently from the words levied and collected used in sub section PG NO In this context reference has to be made to a decision of this Court which had to consider a provision almost identical with of the Act appearing in the Finance Act in a somewhat indirect manner as the decision contains some observations which at first sight appear to support the line of argument of the petitioner herein This decision was really concerned with ZD of the Income Tax Act which in turn called for a reference to of the Finance Act which is in the following terms I When goods of the description mentioned in this section chargeable with a duty of excise under the Central Excises Act are assessed to duty there shall be levied and collected a as respects certain goods a special duty of excise equal to per cent of the total amount so chargeable on such goods as respects certain other goods a special duty of excise equal to per cent apply in relation to the levy and collection of the duty of excise leviable under this section in respect of any goods as they apply in relation to the levy and collection of the duties of excise on such goods under that Act or rules Duty of excise was defined by the section to mean the duty of excise leviable under the Central Excises Salt Act The question was whether the tax credit could also be given in respect of the amount of the special duty of excise levied and collected under the Finance Act It said It is true that the expression leviable is an expression of wide import and includes stages of quantification and recovery of the duty but in the context in which that expression has been used in clause of sub section of ZD it is clear that it has been used in the sense of chargeability to duty In other words the duty of excise in respect whereof tax credit is available would be in respect of such duty of excise as is chargeable under the Excise Act and clearly the Special excise duty in respect whereof additional tax credit is sought by the appellant company is not chargeable under the Excise Act but chargeable under the Excise Act Having said this the <ORG> added Sub clauses and of of the Finance Act on which reliance has been placed by counsel for the appellant company in terms refers to the procedural aspect such as the qualification and collection of the special duty and simply because the qualification and collection of the special duty under the Finance Act is to he done in accordance with the provisions of the Excise Act such duty does not become leviable that is to say chargeable under the Excise Act The above observations no doubt lend some support to the contention of the petitioner as the wording of of the Finance Act is identical with that of and has been interpreted as attracting only the procedural aspect of the Central Excise Act There are three ingredients of the charging provision viz The additional duties are charged a on manufacture storage of production of certain named goods at the rates specified in the first schedule Now the assessable value is to be determined on the basis of which the special duty will have to be worked out cannot be found out from the Act which contains no definition or indication in this regard Having regard to the nature and content of the levy indicated in it is obvious that has to have the effect of attracting not only the purely procedural and machinery provisions of the Act but also some of its charging provisions I have referred to the fact that a provision similar to that in of the Finance Act is also found in other Finance Act On perusal of these provisions it will be found that a like position exists there also A question has been raised as to why if it were the intention of the <ORG> to take in all the provisions PG NO including definitions from the Act it was considered necessary to make a specific reference to the definitions of the various goods on which additional duty was being imposed as contained in the schedule to the Act of the Central Sales Act applies to declared goods as defined in and enumerated in of that Act as being of special importance in inter state trade and commerce enumerates various items of goods among which arc the six items specified in of the Act and this list further specifies that they shall have the same meaning as is attached to the respective items in the First Schedule to the Central Excises Salt Act vide items ii a vii viii ix The idea in was to restrict the powers of the States to levy sales tax in respect of such goods and other goods In the idea was conceived of the <ORG> levying an additional excise duty on these goods and distributing the same to the States subject to the condition specified in Schedule II that such States did not impose any sale or purchase tax on these commodities it was realised that served no specific purpose under the Act except that of the definitions which was an aspect PG NO already covered by The next question that arises for considerion is whether even assuming that the terms of are applicable its terms are wide enough to take in not merely the provisions of the Central Excises and Salt Act and in particular its definition clauses as they stood in on the date when the Act came into force but also the amendments effected therein from time to time Legislatures sometimes take a short cut and try to reduce the length of statutes by omitting elaborate provisions where such provisions have already been enacted earlier and can be adopted for the purpose on hand In this event the provisions of the earlier Act or those so incorporated as they stand in the earlier Act at the time of incorporation will be read into the later Act It may only make a reference of a broad nature as to thc law on a subject generally as in <NAME> <NAME> Whether a particular statute falls into the first or second category is always a question of construction In the present case in my view the legislation falls into the second category It only declares generally that the provisions of the Act shall apply so far as may be that is to the extent necessary and practical for the purposes of the Act as well That apart it has been held even when a specific provision is incorporated and the case apparently falls in the first of the above categories that the rule that repeals modifications or amendments of the earlier Act will have to be ignored is not adhered to incertain situations <ORG> was considering the question whether the amendment of of the Penal Code by the Criminal Law Amendment Act then the borrowed provisions become an integral and independent part of the subsequent Act and are totally uneffected by any repeal or amendment in the previous Act This principle however will not apply in the following cases a where the subsequent Act and the previous Act are supplemental to each other where the two Acts are in pari materia where the amendment in the previous Act if not imported into the subsequent Act also would render the subsequent Act wholly unworkable and uneffectual and where the amendment of the previous Act either PG NO expressly or by necessary intendment applies the said provisions to the subsequent Act The present case falls within the scope of these exceptions even if is construed as incorporating certain specific provisions of the into itself While the Act imposes a general levy of excise duty on all goods manufactured and produced and aim of the present Act is to supplement the levy by an additional duty of the same nature on certain goods There is no reason or logic why all the incidents attaching under the earlier legislation in so as they are not clearly inconsistent with the later one should not be extended to the later legislation as well In the circumstances I agree that we should give full and literal effect to the language of and hold that it has the effect not only of attracting the procedural provisions of the Act but also all its other provisions including those Containing the definition
