It appears that she committed certain misconduct as a result of which her services were terminated by the employer on th December Having regard to the said misconduct as also her other past misconducts the workman was dismissed from service She even refused to accept the dues as admissible to her and the same was sent by Money Order on The appellant herein espoused the cause of Smt As the conciliation proceedings failed the matter was referred to <ORG> under Section of the Industrial Disputes Act for short the Act Aggrieved the appellant who espoused the cause of the workman filed a petition under Article of the Constitution before <ORG> A learned Single Judge of <ORG> dismissed the writ petition A letters patent appeal filed by the appellant also met with the same fate In <NAME> case supra it was held by the <ORG> that where a domestic inquiry is found defective and the employer leads evidence before <ORG> and subsequently <ORG> gives its approval that the charges are proved the order of termination would relate back to the date of original order of termination SCC this <ORG> however observed that some of the decisions rendered by this <ORG> subsequent to <NAME> case supra require a relook as the same are not in consonance with the <ORG> decision Section A of the Industrial Disputes Act for short the Act confers a wide power upon <ORG> <ORG> or the National <ORG> to give appropriate relief in case of discharge or dismissal of workmen While adjudicating on a reference made to it <ORG> <ORG> or the National <ORG> as the case may be if satisfied that the order of discharge or dismissal was not justified it may while setting aside the same direct reinstatement of the workman on such terms and conditions if any as it thinks fit or give such other relief to the workman including the award of any lesser punishment in lieu of discharge or dismissal as the circumstances of the case may require But once whether on the basis of the evidences brought on record in the domestic inquiry or by reason of additional evidence the employer makes out a case justifying the order of dismissal we fail to understand as to how such order of dismissal can be given effect to only from the date of the award and not from the date of passing of the order of punishment According to the learned senior counsel there is a difference between a termination which is not followed by an inquiry and where inquiry is found to be defective on account of procedural breach It is not in dispute that in a proceeding for obtaining approval of an order of dismissal from <ORG> or <ORG> as the case may be in terms of Section of the Act or where a reference has been made under Section thereof if it is found that an inquiry has been conducted in violation of the principles of natural justice the employer is entitled to raise the said question in its written statement by way of preliminary issues and pray for grant of such an opportunity to prove the charges levelled against him In such a case the employer would not have the benefit which he had in cases where domestic inquiries have been held It was pointed out that the import effect of commission to hold an enquiry was merely this that the tribunal would not have to consider only whether there was a prima fade case but would decide for itself on the evidence adduced whether the charges have really been made out no difference whether the matter comes before the tribunal for approval under or on a reference under of the Industrial Disputes Act In either case if the enquiry is defective or if no enquiry has been held as required by Standing orders the entire case would be open before the tribunal and the employer would have to justify on facts as well that its order of dismissal or discharge was proper <ORG> was on a reference under and the same principle was applied there also the only difference being that in that case there was an enquiry though it was defective A defective enquiry in our opinion stands on the same footing as no enquiry and in either case the tribunal would have jurisdiction to go into the facts and the employer would have to satisfy the tribunal that on facts the order of dismissal or discharge was proper The employer thus has got a right to adduce evidence before the <ORG> justifying its action even where no domestic inquiry whatsoever has been held SCR this Court while interpreting the provision of Section A of the Act held that in terms thereof the management need not necessarily rely on the materials on record as while introducing Section A of the Act the <ORG> must have been aware of the decisions of this Court which are operating in the field for long time The Court formulated the propositions of law emerging from the decisions rendered by this Court the relevant portions whereof are as under From those decisions the following principles broadly emerge Even if no enquiry has been held by an employer of if the enquiry held by him is found to be defective the <ORG> in order to satisfy itself about the legality and validity of the order has to give an opportunity to the employer and employee to adduce evidence for the first time justifying his action and it is open to the employee to adduce evidence contra The <ORG> gets jurisdiction to consider the evidence placed before it for the first time in justification of the action taken only if no enquiry has been held or after the enquiry conducted by an employer is found to be defective It has never been recognized that the <ORG> should straightaway without anything more direct reinstatement of a dismissed or discharged employee once it is found that no domestic enquiry has been held or the said enquiry is found to be defective Case supra SCR <ORG> sought to make a distinction between an approval which is required to be made under Section of the Act and a reference under Section thereof stating <ORG> was cited to support the view of relation back of the Award to the date of the employer termination orders We do no agree that the ratio of <ORG> corroborates the proposition propounded If the <ORG> for the first time passes an order recording a finding of misconduct and thus breathes life into the dead shall of the Management order predating of the nativity does not arise The reference to Sasa Musa <ORG> enlightens this position The latter case of <ORG> supra specifically refers to <ORG> case and <NAME> case and holds that where the Management discharges a workmen by an order which is void for want of an enquiry or for blatant violation of rules of natural justice the relation back doctrine cannot be invoked The jurisprudential difference between a void order which by a subsequent judicial resuscitation comes into being de novo and an order which may suffer from some defects but is not still born or void and all that is needed in the law to make it good is a subsequent approval by a tribunal which if granted cannot be obfuscated When in terms of the proviso appended to clauses of Section of the Act an approval is sought for and is refused the order of dismissal becomes void If an approval is not obtained still the order of punishment cannot be given effect to It is therefore not correct to contend that the <ORG> in a reference under Section of the Act when passes an order recording a finding of misconduct brings life into the dead Unfortunately the Court did not take notice of the binding decisions in <ORG> case supra and <ORG> case supra We may however observe that although in certain contingencies an employer may in a case of grave nature of misconduct dismiss a workman without holding an enquiry but ordinarily such an enquiry will not be dispensed with In the event it is found ultimately by <ORG> that the employer had taken recourse to unfair labour practice or the order of termination has been passed malafide or by way of victimization it will be open to the <ORG> to pay compensation even in a case where ultimately charges are proved despite holding that the order of termination is valid for the reason that principles of natural justice have not complied with For the aforesaid reasons we do not find any merit in this appeal
