the plaintiff purchased it in in execution of a decree and the sale was made expressly subject to a mortgage in favour of one <NAME> A decree was obtained in due course by the mortgagee and at the execution sale which followed the mortgagee became the purchaser Subsequently he transferred the property to the third defendant from whom the plaintiff now seeks to recover possession The <ORG> of first instance held that the plaintiff was entitled to a decree for possession without redeeming the purchaser at the mortgage sale Upon appeal the District Judge reversed that decision and held that although the title of the plaintiff as the holder of the equity of redemption might be declared his claim for possession must be rejected as he had not offered to redeem the purchaser at the mortgage sale The plaintiff as holder of the equity of redemption is not entitled to recover possession after the mortgage sale has taken place The fact that he was left out of the mortgage suit does not nullify the decree in that litigation I A It is not necessary for our present purpose to consider whether the mortgagee can still sue the plaintiff on his mortgage of The plaintiff respondent has at this stage offered to redeem the defendant but for this we would have directed that the decree should declare his right to redeem and disallow his claim for recovery of possession The result is that this appeal is allowed the decree made by Mr Justice <NAME> set aside and the case remitted to the District Judge so that a decree may be made in favour of the plaintiff as if this were framed as a suit for redemption An account will betaken by the District Judge of the amount due on the mortgage decree including interest thereon up to the date when the mortgagee purchaser was placed in possession by the <ORG> The interest due thereafter will be set off against the profits received from the land by the mortgagee purchaser The plaintiff must pay the contesting defendants their costs in all the <ORG>s which will be added to the sum due under the mortgage decree If the aggregate sum so calculated is deposited by the plaintiff in <ORG> to the credit of the contesting defendants within six months from the date when the decree is drawn up by the District Judge pursuant to this judgment the plaintiff will recover possession upon redemption If the plaintiff fails to make the deposit as directed the suit will stand dismissed with costs in all the <ORG>s
