of this Court a submission was made on behalf of the petitioner that in the light of the decision of this Court in the case of Administrator Municipal Corporation Bilaspur Supra decided by a Bench of three learned Judges of this Court construing Section of the Act the question as to the constitutional validity of that proviso arises for consideration Taking note of the said submission the bench passed the order dated relevant portion of which reads as follows In view of the construction made by a Bench of three learned Judges in the above quoted decision the question of considering the constitutional validity of the provision does arise The question that arises for consideration is when several items of properties houses buildings or lands within the municipality the annual letting value of each of which dose not exceed Rs Since determination of the question largely depends on interpretation of Section A and its interaction with other relevant provisions of the Act it would be convenient to quote the relevant statutory provisions before proceeding to consider the merits of the case Definition of annual letting value In this Chapter the expression annual letting value shall mean i where any building or land is let out the annual rent for which it is actually let out ii where the rent of any building has been determined under the Madhya Pradesh Accommodation Control Act of the annual rent as so determined and iii in any other case the annual rent for which any building or land exclusive of furniture or machinery contained or situated therein or thereon might reasonably be expected to let from year to year and shall include any payment made or agreed to be made by a tenant to the owner of the building or land on account of occupation taxes insurance or other charges incidental to the tenancy Provided that if it appears to the <ORG> that the annual rent of any building or land is much lower than the annual rent for which it might reasonably be expected to let at the time of assessment such letter rent shall be deemed to be the annual letting value in respect of such building or land Section reads as follows Taxes which may be imposed A Council may from time to time and subject to the provisions of this Chapter and any general or Special order which the State Government may make in this behalf impose in the whole or in any part of the Municipality any of the following taxes for the purposes of the Act namely a tax payable by the owner of houses buildings or lands situated within the limits of Municipality with reference to annual letting value of the house building or land called property tax A Imposition of property tax Notwithstanding anything contained in this Chapter as and from the financial year there shall be charged levied and paid for each financial year a tax on the lands or buildings or both situate in a Municipality other than Class IV Municipality at the rate specified in the table below TABLE where the annual letting value per centum of the annual exceeds Rs but does not letting value exceed Rs ii where the annual letting value per centum of the exceeds Rs but does not annual letting value exceed Rs iii where the annual letting value per centum of the annual exceeds Rs but does not letting value exceed Rs iv where the annual letting value per centum of the annual exceeds Rs but does not letting value exceed Rs letting value The property tax levied under sub section shall not be leviable in respect of the following properties namely a building and lands owned by or vesting in i the Union Government ii <ORG> iii the Council buildings and lands the annual letting value of which does not exceed eighteen hundred rupees Provided that if any such building or land in the ownership of a person who owns any other building or land in the same Municipality the annual letting value of such building or land shall for the purpose of this clause be deemed to be the aggregate annual letting value of all buildings or lands owned by him in the Municipality Emphasis supplied xxx xxx xxx From the statutory provisions quoted above it is clear that the incidence of the tax is the house building or land situated within the limits of the municipality The amount of tax to be paid by the owner is to be determined with reference to the annual letting value of the house building or land in question The manner of determination of the annual letting value is prescribed in section of the Act The Table in Section which provides for the rate at which the tax is to be levied starts with property the annual letting value of which exceeds Rs This position is further clarified in clause of subsection of Section in which it is laid down that house building and lands annual letting value of which does not exceed Rs which is owned by a person who owns any other building or land in the same municipality the annual letting value of such building or land shall be deemed to be the aggregate annual letting value of all building or lands owned by him in the municipality Then the further question for determination is whether such a building or land annual letting value of which does not exceed Rs The provision in sub section of section A which is a charging section makes no provision regarding the rate at which the tax is to be paid in case the building or land in question annual letting value of which is less than Rs Another question that arises for consideration in this connection is whether sub section of Section A and the proviso to sub section should be construed together and the annual letting values of all the buildings owned by a person to be taken together for determining the amount to be paid as tax in respect of each building It is not the economic results sought to be obtained by making the provision which is relevant in interpreting a fiscal statute Words cannot be added to or substituted so as to give a meaning to the statute which will serve the spirit and intention of the legislature The statute should clearly and unambiguously convey the three components of the tax law i the subject of the tax the person who is liable to pay the tax and the rate at which the tax is to be paid If there is any ambiguity regarding any of these ingredients in a taxation statute then there is no tax in law As Lord <NAME> said many years ago in at As understand the principle of all fiscal legislation it is this If the person sought to be taxed conies within the letter of the law he must be taxed however great the hardship may appear to the judicial mind to be On the other hand if the <ORG> seeking to recover the tax cannot bring the subject within the letter of the law the subject is free however apparently within the spirit of the law the case might otherwise appear to be The All England Law Reports page Lord <NAME> in his opinion at page observed My Lords there is a maxim of income tax law which though it may sometimes be over stressed yet ought not to be forgotten It is that the subject is not to be taxed unless the words of the taxing statute unambiguously impose the tax on him and that the deeming proviso to clause of sub section as expressly stated is for the purpose of this claluse held that since the aggregation of annual letting value of all buildings or lands is permitted then all such buildings or lands have to be taken as one unit for the purpose of taxation The <ORG> was of the view that any other construction would render the proviso nugatory and defeat the object of the Act The construction placed on the said provision does not flow from the plain language of the provision Take for instance a case where a person owns buildings of which are small ones fetching annual rental value of Rs each then applying the ratio of Administrator <ORG> Bilaspur supra the annual rental value of each of the small buildings will come to Rs The appeal is allowed and the judgment of <ORG> under challenge is set aside
