The mosque stood on a portion of this area and the rest of it was let out to tenants the rents being appropriated for the expenses of the mosque <NAME> or <NAME> continued to hold this area of land as mutwali of the mosque until his death about seventy years ago and after him his son Sheikh <NAME> succeeded him as mutwali A preliminary decree for partition was actually made in that suit in The plaint in that suit was subsequently amended on December By the addition of all the heirs of <NAME> as defendants who it was alleged were claiming the property as their personal property and by adding a prayer for the declaration that the property in suit was wakf property and not the personal property of the defendants On September a petition of compromise was filed in that suit on behalf of plaintiffs Nos and i The first two paragraphs of the petition were as follows That your petitioners have on consideration of all the circumstances and facts as disclosed in the evidence produced in the case and which the parties may produce on their behalf have decided that it would be to their best interest and in the interest of public for whose benefit the plaintiffs brought this suit to compromise the suit on the following terms and conditions That out of the disputed property the portions shown in the plan herewith tiled and marked A measuring bigha cotta cbhattaks sq On September the following order was passed on the petition by the District Judge The compromise has now been accepted by all parties to the suit My previous order of September refers to a petition filed on behalf of ten defendants They alleged that the partition decree in Suit No of as well as the compromise decree in Suit No of wore not binding upon them and they also prayed that the whole of the then area of bighas cottas chhattaks may be declared wakf property and the defendants restrained from obtaining possession either directly or by realising rents of the said <ORG> By his judgment dated July the Subordinate Judge held that the whole of the holding was wakf and that the plaintiffs as worshippers iu the mosque were entitled to maintain the suit in that Court without the Senction of the Advocate General and that the compromise decree in Suit No of was without jurisdiction and not binding upon them and he accordingly passed a decree in favour of the plaintiffs They entertained considerable doubt as to the maintainability of such a suit as this without the sanction of the Advocate General under Section of the Code of Civil Procedure having regard to Sub section which has been added to the corresponding Section of the Code of Civil Procedure but they considered it unnecessary to decide the point as they were of opinion that the plaintiffs were bound by the rule of res judicata and the suit should be dismissed on that ground The first is whether the suit is maintainable in view of the provisions of Sub section of Section of the Code of Civil Procedure and the second is whether the suit is barred by the rule of res judicata under Explanation Section Civil Procedure Code It is urged broadly on behalf of the respondents that all Buits founded upon any breach of trust for public purposes of a charitable or religious nature irrespective of the relief sought must be brought in accordance with the provisions of Section Civil Procedure Code If it had so intended it would have said so in express words whereas it said on the contrary that only suits claiming any of the reliefs specified in Sub section shall be instituted in conformity with the provisions of Section Sub section The reliefs specified in Sub section a to do not cover any of the reliefs claimed in this suit unless the words further or other relief in Clause can be held to cover them First because the words further or other relief must on general principles of construction be taken to mean relief of the same nature as Clauses a to Secondly because such construction would cut down substantive rights which existed prior to the enactment of the Code of and it is unlikely that in a Code regulating procedure the <ORG> intended without express words to abolish or extinguish substantive rights of an important nature which admittedly existed at that time It is a sound rule of interpretation to take the words of a statute as they stand and to interpret them ordinarily without any reference to the previous state of the law on the subject or the English law upon which it may hi founded but when it is contended that the <ORG> intended by any particular amendment to make substantial changes in the pre existing law it ie impossible to arrive at a conclusion without considering what the law was previously to the particular enactment and to see whether the words used in the statute can be taken to effect the change that is suggested as intended Section where particular reliefs only were sought in such cases Most of <ORG> held that the power to appoint a new trustee necessarily involved the power to remove an old trustee The <ORG> in adopt the former view and inserted Clause a expressly giving power to remove a trustee in addition to the power to appoint new trustees now Clause Accounts and inquiries though not expressly mentioned in the relief clauses had been held by some of the <ORG> to be necessarily incidental to the power to remove an old trustee and appoint a new one But the most important change was made by Sub section of Section Under the Code of as well as the Code of the question had arisen whether Section was mandatory and therefore all suits claiming any relief mentioned in Section should be brought as required by that section or whether the remedy provided by Section was in addition to any other remedy that existed under the law for the redress of any wrongful action in connection with a public trust of a charitable or religious nature Such rights when claimed on behalf of the public or any section thereof had been held to be capable of enforcement by a suit under Section of those Codes now replaced by Order I Rule and it had also been held that private persons who had individual rights under such trusts could bring suits to enforce such individual rights by an ordinary suit without being obliged to bring a suit of a representative nature as above mentioned that a suit which prayed for any of the relief mentioned in Section could only be instituted in accordance with the provisions of that section The words used in Sub section are appropriate and sufficient if that was the purpose but they are insufficient and inadequate if it was intended to make a complete change such as is suggested on behalf of the respondents Their Lordships see no reason to consider that Section was intended to enlarge tho scope of Section by the addition of any relief or remedy against third parties i strangers to the trust The only other question is whether the suit is barred by the rule of res judicata i whether the compromise decree of September in Suit No of precludes the present from bringing this suit it is said that the previous Suit No of was instituted under the provisions of Section with the sanction of the Advocate General and therefore became a representative suit and the decree in that suit whether by adjudication of the <ORG> or by consent of parties is binding upon that section of the public which was represented by the plaintiffs that suit and therefore upon the plaintiffs in the present suit by virtue of Explanation of Section of the Code The learned Judges of <ORG> were of opinion that the consent decree of could not be questioned on the grounds stated by the Subordinate Judge as there was no want of jurisdiction of the Judge to entertain the suit or to order the amendment as prayed for or to direct a decree to be made on compromise of the suit It is extremely doubtful whether a decree passed under the circumstances of this case can be held to be res judicata as against any persons other than those who consented to that decree was based on Scottish law and as explained in the case of In re South American and Mexican Company Ex part Bank of England Ch appears to lay down broadly that persons instituting a suit on behalf of the public have no right to bind the public by a compromise decree though a decree passed against them on contest would bind the public by adding strangers to the trust as defendants and by prayers for relief not covered by Section the suit ceased to be one of a representative character and the decree based on the compromise such as it was viz On both grounds therefore the arguments for the respondents fail and their Lordships will humbly advise <NAME> that the decree of <ORG> be set aside and the judgment and decree of the Subordinate Judge restored with costs of <ORG> appeal and the costs of this appeal
