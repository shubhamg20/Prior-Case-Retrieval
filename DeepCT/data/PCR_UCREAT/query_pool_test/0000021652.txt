It is alleged provoked by the aforesaid conduct and behaviour she committed suicide The complainant and father of the deceased aggrieved by the order of <ORG> preferred these appeals by way of special leave to appeal While civil case may be proved by mere preponderance of evidence in criminal cases the prose cution must prove the charge beyond reasonable doubt There is a higher standard of proof in criminal cases than in civil cases but there is no absolute standard in either of the cases The standard adopted must be the standard adopted by a prudent man which of course may vary from case to case circumstances to circumstances Per <NAME> Ray Circumstantial evidence as well as the prosecution witnesses in the instant case clearly prove beyond doubt that the accused instigated and abetted Ravind er Kaur deceased in the commission of the offence by com mitting suicide by burning herself A The suicide having been committed within a period of seven years from the date of her marriage in accordance with the provisions of Section A the Court may presume having regard to all the other circumstances of the case that such suicide had been abetted by the husband and his relations She used to visit her parents at Amritsar occa sionally and during those visits she used to tell them that there was demand for dowry and also taunting of her by the members of the family of her in laws and also insinuation that she was carrying on illegitimate child There are sufficient relevant and acceptable evidence to that effect It is alleged that provoked by the aforesaid conduct and behaviour she committed suicide Learned Addl Sessions Judge held that there was absence of burn injuries on the fingertips of the mother in law and other members of the family After marriage she used to stay in the house of her in laws at Raja Sansi During these visits she used to tell them that her in laws were not happy with the dowry given to the latter It is further stated that the accused used to tell her that they had been offered by fridge etc On the totality of these evidence on record it was held by the learned Sessions Judge that the accused were guilty of abetment to suicide and as such punishable under of the I <ORG> on appeal was of the view that the guilt of the accused had not been proved and as such acquitted them It was contended on behalf of the accused that there was no direct evidence of the act of suicide by <NAME> There is ample and sufficient evidence that she had complained that she was taunted for bringing meager dowry and that even insinuated that she was carrying an illegitimate child There is also evidence that the persons in the house of her in laws in cluding the mother in law mother of the accused <NAME> made no attempt to save her from the burn injuries The absence of any burn injury in the hands of the people around indicates and establishes that there was no attempt to save the deceased though she was seen being burnt While civil case may be proved by mere preponder ance of evidence in criminal cases the prosecution must prove the charge beyond reasonable doubt There is a higher standard of proof in criminal cases than in civil cases but there is no absolute standard in either of the cases The standard adopted must be the standard adopted by a prudent man which of course may vary from case to case circumstances to circumstances Having regard to the circumstances of the case there is no direct evidence indicating the circumstances in which the death took place the conduct of the accused and the nature of the crime with which the accused was charged there cannot be any scope of doubt that the learned Sessions Judge was right and the conviction was properly made The fact the two view are reasonably possible is not established by the fact that two different conclusions are reached by two adjudica tory authorities For the reasons aforesaid I respectfully agree with the judgment and order proposed by my learned brother These appeals are at the instance of <NAME> the complainant against the judgment and order passed in Criminal Appeal No SB of by <ORG> at Chandigarh acquitting the accused re spondents of the charge under of the Indian Penal Code on setting aside the conviction and sentence passed by the Additional Session Judge on August convicting and sentencing all the accused The appeal was allowed on holding that there was no evidence on record that the ac cused at the time of commission of suicide by <NAME> in any way instigated or abetted her to commit suicide and as such the prosecution failed to establish the charge against the accused and their conviction consequently can not be sustained She used to visit the house of her parents at Amritsar occasionally and during these visits she used to tell them that her in laws were not happy with the dowry given to her and they used to taunt her and insisted her to bring more dowry and that they even used to taunt her that her parents at the time of the marriage did not serve them with proper meals The accused also used to tell her that they were being offered Fridge etc after <NAME> his father <NAME> accused and his mother <NAME> along with <NAME> and <NAME> maternal uncles of <NAME> came to the house of <NAME> at Amritsar and pursuaded that he should send <NAME> with them where upon <NAME> told them that his daughter complained against the ill treatment and cruel behaviour towards her for bringing insufficient dowry and they also taunted her for this as well as for her illegitimate child and put pressure on her to bring more dowry On June <NAME> <ORG> Ajnala came to the dead house at Amritsar at about and examined the dead body of <NAME> He recorded the statements of <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> All the three accused were charged for an offence under of the Indian Penal Code and they pleaded not guilty to the charge framed against them He further held referring to the provisions of A of the Evidence Act that having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case it may be presumed that the ac cused persons have abetted the suicide committed by the deceased and they fail to reverse this prosecution case by any evidence The accused respondents preferred an appeal being Crimi nal Appeal No of in <ORG> and Haryana The appeal was allowed and the conviction and sentence was set aside on the ground that the prosecution failed to establish the charge against the accused persons It has been contended by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant that the cruel behaviour mal treatment and taunts for not bringing sufficient dowry have been made to the deceased <NAME> soon after her coming to the house of her in laws <NAME> father of the deceased on these assurances given by the accused and their relations sent his daughter <NAME> to her in laws house Being depressed with these taunts and iII treatment the deceased committed suicide by sprinkling kerosene on her person and setting her to fire The court of appeal below had wrongly found that the prosecution could not prove charge against the accused and set aside the order of con viction and sentence made by the trial court and acquitted the accused It has been urged in this connection that the defence that it was a case of accidental fire and not of suicide was also not believed by the trial court and the trial court gave very cogent and plausible reasons for not believing this story and holding that it was a case of suicide committed by the deceased <NAME> by the taunts and ill treatment made to her by her in laws and this forced her to take her own life by suicide It has been submitted that the accused have abetted the commission of suicide by <NAME> deceased and the accused are therefore guilty of the said charge The learned counsel Mr <NAME> has made three fold submissions before this Court He has further submitted that the prosecution has not proved beyond reasonable doubts that the deceased committed suicide The prosecution did not prove that there was any instigation by the accused persons charged with the offence in this case PF lodged by the complainant it has been specifi cally stated that due to constant harassment of <NAME> by the accused persons for having brought less dowry in her marriage as well as due to constant taunts and also torture the deceased committed suicide by pouring kerosene oil on her and burnt herself and afterwards she died <NAME> has also stated in his deposition that his daughter used to tell them that her husband father in law and mother in law always taunted her saying that her parents had not given sufficient dowry during the marriage and had not even served them with proper meals at the time of marriage He further stated that on th June at <NAME> maternal uncle of <NAME> came to shop and told him that his daughter had committed suicide by sprinkling kerosene oil on her body and then setting her on fire It has also been stated that due to the bad treatment meted out towards his daughter <NAME> at the hands of her husband <NAME> her mother inlaw <NAME> and her father in law <NAME> that she had not brought scooter and fridge and had brought less dowry in her marriage they had forced her to put kerosene oil on her body and commit suicide and as they often taunted her saying that she had begotten immoral and illegal pregnancy and for this reason she had committed suicide and thus had lost her life Furthermore though the house of the accused persons is not far off yet the information was given not by his son in law or other members of the family promptly but it was given by the maternal uncle of the son in law <NAME> at to the appellant although the incident occurred at about It is also evident that the deceased <NAME> who had second to third degree burns on her person was brought to the hospital in the evening and the doctor I immediately examined her and declared that she was already dead <ORG> rightly held that the intending circumstances show that she was not allowed to move till the process of burning had become irrecoverable and till she succumbed to her injuries We do not find any infirmity in this finding and we also hold on consideration and appraisement of the evidences as well as the circumstances set out hereinbefore that it was not a case of accidental fire but a case of suicide commit ted by the deceased <NAME> being constantly abused taunted for bringing less dowry and also being defamed for carrying an illegitimate child It is pertinent to mention that in the appeal before <ORG> it was not urged on behalf of the accused that the case of suicide was not proved and as such there was no finding by <ORG> on this score I shows that before a person can be convicted of abetting the suicide of any other person it must be established that such other person committed sui cide This decision is not at all applicable to the instant case in view of our specific finding that the evidence adduced on behalf of the prosecution clearly establish that the deceased <NAME> committed suicide at the instiga tion and abetment of the accused persons in the commission of the said offence It has also been urged that <ORG> considered the evidences and came to a reasonable finding that the prosecution could not prove the ingredients of Section IPC as there was no instigation by the accused nor there was any conspiracy for the commission of that offence It is for the Judge of fact to consider in each case whether as a result of such cross examination and contradiction the witness stands thoroughly discredited or can still be believed in regard to a part of his testimony If the Judge finds that in the process the credit of the witness has not been completely shaken he may after reading and considering the evidence of the witness as a whole with due caution and care accept in the light of the other evidence on the record that part of his testimony which he finds to be creditworthy and act upon it We have already referred to the material portions of the FIR as well as all the statements made by in his evidence as well as his statement under Section Cr The appellant sometime in November went to her in laws house On hearing this her father brought her to his house and after eight days the accused persons <NAME> his father <NAME> and two maternal uncles came to the house of the appellant and requested him to send his daughter with them assuring that there would be no further taunts or any iII treatment by the respondents <NAME> told them that there was no improvement in the treatment meted out to her and she was being taunted and tortured by her in laws in the same way and she was not happy They had also taunted that she was having illegitimate child She further stated that two days prior to the present occurrence she and her sister <NAME> went to Raja Sansi to enquire about the welfare of our sister <NAME> who told them weepingly that she was being beaten by the accused and again was mal treated for bringing less dowry and scooter and fridge etc She further stated that the respondents were leveling allegations that she had been carrying an illegiti mate child and that she should die It was also stated by her that her mother in law <NAME> was present in the house and she was abusing <NAME> in their presence This finding was arrived at by the learned Sessions Judge on a proper appreciation of the evidences adduced by the prosecution <ORG> without properly considering and weighing the evidences of the prosecution witnesses and on a wrong appreciation of the evidences found that the prosecution failed to prove the ingredients of Section of I It was also held that there was no evidence on record that the accused at the time of commis sion of suicide by <NAME> deceased in any way insti gated or abetted her to commit suicide even though it has been brought but in evidences that the deceased was being maltreated by the accused continuously after her coming to the house of her in laws It was further held that the prosecution has singularly failed to establish the charge against the accused and their conviction and sentences were consequently unsustainable We have already stated hereinfore that <NAME> <NAME> have clearly stated in their depositions about the ill treatment torture and the cruel behaviour meted out to the deceased <NAME> which instigated her to take the extreme step of putting an end to her life by sprinkling kerosene oil on her body and setting fire We have also stated hereinbefore that though the incident occurred at the information of the death of <NAME> by burning was given to her father <NAME> at in his shop at Amritsar It is also in evidence that <NAME> was brought to the hospital after much delay when she was already dead We have already referred to hereinbefore the evidences of the prosecution witnesses who clearly testified to the greedy and lusty nature of the accused in that they persist ently taunted the deceased and tortured her for not having brought sufficient dowry from her father Circumstantial evidence as well as the evidences of the prosecution witnesses clearly prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused persons instigated and abetted <NAME> deceased in the commission of the offence by committing suicide by burning herself <ORG> drew an inference from the conduct of <NAME> in making a delay of about hours after receipt of the information regarding her daughter death to make a statement to the police about the incident with lodging the I on the same date i June or on the following morning It has been rightly held by the Additional Sessions Judge that in the circumstances it cannot be said that there has been any delay in reporting the matter to the police We fully accept this finding of the Additional Sessions Judge and we also held that the delay in lodging the FIR in the above circumstances does not raise any doubt regarding the veracity of the said two witnesses and there is no infirmity in the evidences of and which would render them unsafe to base the conviction of the accused as wrongly observed by the High Court It is also convenient to refer to this connection to the provisions of Section A of Indian Evidence Act which provide that A Presumption as to abetment of suicide by a married women When the question is whether the commission of suicide by a woman had been abetted by her husband or any rela tive of her husband and it is shown that she had committed suicide within a period of seven years from the date of her marriage and that her husband or such relative of her husband had subjected her to cruelty the court may presume having regard to all the other circumstances of the case that such suicide had been abetted by her husband or by such relative of her husband In the instant case the deceased <NAME> was married to the accused <NAME> in November and she committed suicide on June It has also been found on a consideration of the circumstantial evidence that she was compelled to take the extreme step of committing suicide as the accused persons had subjected her to cruelty by constant taunts mal treatment and also by alleging that she has been carrying an illegitimate child The suicide having been committed within a period of seven years from the date of her marriage in accordance with the provisions of this Section the Court may presume having regard to all the other circumstances of the case which we have set out earlier that such suicide has been abetted by the husband and his relations It has been contended on behalf of the accused respond ents that Section A of the Indian Evidence Act was inserted in the Statutes Book by Act of whereas the offence under Section I It has therefore been submitted by the learned counsel for the respondents that the provi sions of this Section cannot be taken recourse to while coming to a finding regarding the presumption as to abetment of suicide committed by a marriage woman against the ac cused persons The provisions of the said Section do not create any new offence and as such it does not create any substantial right but it is merely a matter of procedure of evidence and as such it is retrospective and will be applicable to this case It is profitable to refer in this connection to Hals bury Laws of England Fourth Edition Volume Page wherein it has been stated that The general rule as mat all statutes other than those which are merely declaratory or which relate only to mat ters of procedure or of evidence are prima facie prospective and retrospective effect is not to be given to them unless by express words or necessary implication it appears that this was the intention of the legislature It has also been stated in the said volume of <ORG> at page that The presumption against retrospection does not apply to legislation concerned merely with matters of procedure or of evidence on the contrary provisions of that nature are to be construed as retrospective unless there is a clear indication that such was not the inten tion of <ORG> During the pendency of the application section of the Matrimonial Causes Act came into force on July which provided that any presumption of condonation which arises from the contin uance or resumption of marital intercourse may be rebutted on the part of a husband as well as on the part a of wife by evidence sufficient to negative the necessary intent The question arose whether this provision which came into force on July can be applied in the instant case It was held that the husband evidence was admissible in that Section of the Act of only altered the law as to the admissibility of evidence and the effect which the courts are to give to evidence so that the rule against giving retrospective effect to Acts of Parliament did not apply For the reasons aforesaid we set aside the judgment and order of acquittal passed by <ORG> and affirm the conviction of the accused of the offence under Section I and sentence imposed upon them by the Additional Sessions Judge Amritsar
