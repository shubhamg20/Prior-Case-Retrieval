The subsequent events tell a different story It was further pointed out that the decision raises more questions than it has answered see Annual Survey of Indian Law at The Survey goes on to observe the principles laid down by the majority in <ORG> are so broadly formulated that they provide sufficient leeway to subsequent courts in applying those principles while the lack of clarity in the judgment allows judicial creativity ibid at The prophecy has come true and while the ink on the opinions in <ORG> was yet to dry <ORG> were flooded with writ petitions calling for settlements of several issues which were not yet resolved or which propped on floor post <ORG> But it is settled that establishing and administering of an educational institution for imparting knowledge to the students is an occupation protected by Article and additionally by Article a if there is no element of profit generation Until <ORG> there were four oft quoted leading cases holding the field of education All these cases amongst others came up for the consideration of this Court in <ORG> Education including technical education medical education and universities subject to the provisions of entries and of List I vocational and technical training of labour <ORG> felt that the matter called for hearing by <ORG> The <ORG> dealt with the questions by classifying the discussion under the following five heads Is there a fundamental right to set up educational institutions and if so under which provision In order to determine the existence of a religious or linguistic minority in relation to Article what is to be the unit the <ORG> or the country as a whole The questions and the answers as given by the majority are set out hereunder What is the meaning and content of the expression minorities in Article of the Constitution of India A Linguistic and religious minorities are covered by the expression minority under Article of the Constitution Since reorganization of the <ORG>s in India has been on linguistic lines therefore for the purpose of determining the minority the unit will be the <ORG> and not the whole of India Thus religious and linguistic minorities who have been put on a par in Article have to be considered <ORG>wise What is meant by the expression religion in Article Can the followers of a sect or denomination of a particular religion claim protection under Article on the basis that they constitute a minority in the State even though the followers of that religion are in majority in that State A This question need not be answered by this Bench it will be dealt with by a regular Bench a What are the indicia for treating an educational institution as a minority educational institution Would an institution be regarded as a minority educational institution because it was established by a person belonging to a religious or linguistic minority or its being administered by a person belonging to a religious or linguistic minority A This question need not be answered by this Bench it will be dealt with by a regular Bench To what extent can professional education be treated as a matter coming under minorities rights under Article A Article gives religious and linguistic minorities the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice The use of the words of their choice indicates that even professional educational institutions would be covered by Article Whether the admission of students to minority educational institution whether aided or unaided can be regulated by <ORG> or by the university to which the institution is affiliated A Admission of students to unaided minority educational institutions viz schools and undergraduate colleges where the scope for merit based selection is practically nil cannot be regulated by the <ORG> or university concerned except for providing the qualifications and minimum conditions of eligibility in the interest of academic standards emphasis by us The right to admit students being an essential facet of the right to administer educational institutions of their choice as contemplated under Article of the Constitution the State Government or the university may not be entitled to interfere with that right so long as the admission to the unaided educational institutions is on a transparent basis and the merit is adequately taken care of The right to administer not being absolute there could be regulatory measures for ensuring educational standards and maintaining excellence thereof and it is more so in the matter of admissions to professional institutions emphasis by us A minority institution does not cease to be so the moment grant in aid is received by the institution An aided minority educational institution therefore would be entitled to have the right of admission of students belonging to the minority group and at the same time would be required to admit a reasonable extent of non minority students so that the rights under Article are not substantially impaired and further the citizens rights under Article are not infringed What would be a reasonable extent would vary from the types of institution the courses of education for which admission is being sought and other factors like educational needs <ORG> concerned has to notify the percentage of the non minority students to be admitted in the light of the above observations Observance of inter se merit amongst the applicants belonging to the minority group could be ensured In the case of aided professional institutions it can also be stipulated that passing of the common entrance test held by the <ORG> agency is necessary to seek admission As regards non minority students who are eligible to seek admission for the remaining seats admission should normally be on the basis of the common entrance test held by the <ORG> agency followed by counselling wherever it exists a Whether the minorities rights to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice will include the procedure and method of admission and selection of students A A minority institution may have its own procedure and method of admission as well as selection of students but such a procedure must be fair and transparent and the selection of students in professional and higher education colleges should be on the basis of merit Even an unaided minority institution ought not to ignore the merit of the students for admission while exercising its right to admit students to the colleges aforesaid as in that event the institution will fail to achieve excellence Whether the minority institutions right of admission of students and to lay down procedure and method of admission if any would be affected in any way by the receipt of State aid A While giving aid to professional institutions it would be permissible for the authority giving aid to prescribe bye rules or regulations the conditions on the basis of which admission will be granted to different aided colleges by virtue of merit coupled with the reservation policy of the State qua non minority students The merit may be determined either through a common entrance test conducted by the university or the <ORG> concerned followed by counselling or on the basis of an entrance test conducted by the individual institutions the method to be followed is for the university or the <ORG> to decide The authority may also devise other means to ensure that admission is granted to an aided professional institution on the basis of merit In the case of such institutions it will be permissible for the <ORG> or the university to provide that consideration should be shown to the weaker sections of the society Whether the statutory provisions which regulate the facets of administration like control over educational agencies control over governing bodies conditions of affiliation including recognition withdrawal thereof and appointment of staff employees teachers and principals including their service conditions and regulation of fees etc would interfere with the right of administration of minorities A So far as the statutory provisions regulating the facets of administration are concerned in case of an unaided minority educational institution the regulatory measure of control should be minimal and the conditions of recognition as well as the conditions of affiliation to a university or board have to be complied with but in the matter of day to day management like the appointment of staff teaching and non teaching and administrative control over them the management should have the freedom and there should not be any external controlling agency However a rational procedure for the selection of teaching staff and for taking disciplinary action has to be evolved by the management itself For redressing the grievances of employees of aided and unaided institutions who are subjected to punishment or termination from service a mechanism will have to be evolved and in our opinion appropriate tribunals could be constituted and till then such tribunals could be presided over by a judicial officer of the rank of District Judge The <ORG> or other controlling authorities however can always prescribe the minimum qualification experience and other conditions bearing on the merit of an individual for being appointed as a teacher or a principal of any educational institution Regulations can be framed governing service conditions for teaching and other staff for whom aid is provided by the <ORG> without interfering with the overall administrative control of the management over the staff Fees to be charged by unaided institutions cannot be regulated but no institution should charge capitation fee a Where can a minority institution be operationally located Where a religious or linguistic minority in State A establishes an educational institution in the said State can such educational institution grant preferential admission reservations and other benefits to members of the religious linguistic group from other States where they are non minorities A This question need not be answered by this Bench it will be dealt with by a regular Bench Whether it would be correct to say that only the members of that minority residing in State A will be treated as the members of the minority vis vis such institution A This question need not be answered by this Bench it will be dealt with by a regular Bench Whether the member of a linguistic non minority in one State can establish a trust society in another State and claim minority status in that State A This question need not be answered by this Bench it will be dealt with by a regular Bench It has to be left to authorities to prescribe a reasonable percentage having regard to the type of institution population and educational needs of minorities except where it holds that primary education is a fundamental right and the scheme framed thereunder require reconsideration modification and if yes what A The scheme framed by this <ORG> in <NAME> case supra and the direction to impose the same except where it holds that primary education is a fundamental right is unconstitutional Reasonable surplus to meet cost of expansion and augmentation of facilities does not however amount to profiteering Whether the non minorities have the right to establish and administer educational institution under Articles and read with Articles and in the same manner and to the same extent as minority institutions and What is the meaning of the expressions education and educational institutions in various provisions of the Constitution Is the right to establish and administer educational institutions guaranteed under the Constitution A The expression education in the articles of the Constitution means and includes education at all levels from the primary school level up to the postgraduate level It includes professional education The expression educational institutions means institutions that impart education where education is as understood hereinabove The right to establish and administer educational institutions is guaranteed under the Constitution to all citizens under Articles and and to minorities specifically under Article All citizens have a right to establish and administer educational institutions under Articles and but this right is subject to the provisions of Articles and a However minority institutions will have a right to admit students belonging to the minority group in the manner as discussed in this judgment Questions such as i what is religion ii what is the indicia for determining if an educational institution is a minority institution iii whether a minority institution can operate extra territorially extending its activities into such states where the minority establishing and administering the institution does not enjoy minority status iv the content and contour of minority by reference to territories were not answered in <ORG> and were left to be determined by the regular Benches in individual cases to be heard after the decision in <ORG> We also do not propose to involve ourselves by dealing with these questions except to the extent it may become necessary to do so for the purpose of answering the questions posed before us This led to litigation in several <ORG>s At the hearing again the parties through their learned counsel tried to interpret the majority decision in <ORG> in different ways as it suited them The parties agreed that there were certain anomalies and doubts calling for clarification The <ORG> formulated four questions as arising for consideration in view of the rival submissions made before the <ORG> in <ORG> whether the educational institutions are entitled to fix their own fee structure whether minority and non minority educational institutions stand on the same footing and have the same rights whether private unaided professional colleges are entitled to fill in their seats to the extent of and if not to what extent and whether private unaided professional colleges are entitled to admit students by evolving their own method of admission The relevant factors which would go into determining the reasonability of a fee structure in the opinion of majority are i the infrastructure and facilities available ii the investments made iii salaries paid to the teachers and staff iv future plans for expansion and betterment of the institution etc Minority educational institutions have a guarantee or assurance to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice The majority opinion called it a special right given under Article What is conferred by Article of the Constitution is certain additional protection with the object of bringing the minorities on the same platform as that of non minorities so that the minorities are protected by establishing and administering educational institutions for the benefit of their own community whether based on religion or language It is clear that as between minority and non minority educational institutions the distinction made by Article in the fundamental rights conferred by Article has been termed by the majority as special right while in the opinion of <NAME> it is not a right but an additional protection Questions and have been taken up for consideration together At some places observations have been made regarding institutions divided into groups only by reference to aid that is whether they are aided or unaided educational institutions without regard to the fact whether they were minority or non minority institutions Without interfering with the autonomy of unaided institutions the object of merit based admissions can be secured by insisting on it as a condition to the grant of recognition and subject to the recognition of merit the management can be given certain discretion in admitting students The management can have quota for admitting students at its discretion but subject to satisfying the test of merit based admissions which can be achieved by allowing management to pick up students of their own choice from out of those who have passed the common entrance test conducted by a centralized mechanism The <ORG> can provide for reservation in favour of financially or socially backward sections of the society The majority opinion carved out an exception in favour of those minority educational professional institutions which were established and were having their own admission procedure for at least years from the requirement of joining any common entrance test and such institutions were permitted to have their own admission procedure The State Governments were directed to appoint a permanent Committee to ensure that the tests conducted by the association of colleges is fair and transparent He also agreed that one single standard for all the institutions was necessary to achieve the object of selection being made on merit by maintaining uniformity of standard which could not be left to any individual institution in the matter of professional courses of study To quote his words the merit criterion would have to be judged like a pyramid At the kindergarten primary secondary levels minorities may have quota At this level the merit may not have much relevance at all but at the level of higher education and in particular professional education and postgraduate level education merit indisputably should be a relevant criterion At the postgraduation level where there may be a few seats the minority institutions may not have much say in the matter Services of doctors engineers and other professionals coming out from the institutions of professional excellence must be made available to the entire country and not to any particular class or group of people All citizens including the minorities have also a fundamental duty in this behalf Before we part with the task of summing up the answers given to the four questions in <ORG> we would like to make a few observations of ours in this regard We would therefore hasten to add that in order to fully appreciate the ratio of the two opinions they have to be read in detail and our attempt at finding out and placing in a few chosen words the ratio decidendi of the two separately recorded opinions is subject to this limitation However we shall make a reference to relevant passages from the two opinions as and when it becomes necessary A point of significance which we would like to briefly note here itself a detailed discussion being relegated to a later part of this judgment is that the opinion of <NAME> has examined in detail the scope of protection conferred on minority institutions by reference to their right to seek recognition or affiliation an aspect of wider significance which does not seem to have received consideration with that emphasis either in <ORG> or in the majority opinion in <ORG> We shall revert to this aspect a little later III Issues herein A Few Preliminary observations Before we embark upon dealing with the issues posed before us for resolution we would like to make a few preliminary observations as a preface to our judgment inasmuch as that would outline the scope of the controversy with which we are actually dealing here At the very outset we may state that our task is not to pronounce our own independent opinion on the several issues which arose for consideration in <ORG> <ORG> in addition to giving clarifications on Interlocutory Applications directed setting up of two committees in each State one committee to give effect to the judgment in <ORG> and to approve the fee structure or to propose some other fee which can be charged by minority institutions vide para and the other committee to oversee the tests to be conducted by the association of institutions vide para Since the direction made in <ORG> for appointment of the Committees has been vehemently assailed during the course of hearing before us we would extract from the judgment in <ORG> the following two passages wherein in the words of <NAME> CJ the purpose and the constitution of the Committees the powers conferred on and the functions enjoined upon them are given we direct that in order to give effect to the judgment in <NAME> case the respective State Governments concerned authority shall set up in each State a committee headed by a retired <ORG> Judge who shall be nominated by the Chief Justice of that State A representative of <ORG> in short <ORG> or <ORG> in short AICTE depending on the type of institution shall also be a member The <ORG> should be free to nominate co opt another independent person of repute so that the total number of members of the <ORG> shall not exceed five Each educational institute must place before this <ORG> well in advance of the academic year its proposed fee structure Along with the proposed fee structure all relevant documents and books of accounts must also be produced before the <ORG> for their scrutiny The <ORG> shall then decide whether the fees proposed by that institute are justified and are not profiteering or charging capitation fee The <ORG> will be at liberty to approve the fee structure or to propose some other fee which can be charged by the institute The fee fixed by the <ORG> shall be binding for a period of three years at the end of which period the institute would be at liberty to apply for revision Once fees are fixed by the <ORG> the institute cannot charge either directly or indirectly any other amount over and above the amount fixed as fees If any other amount is charged under any other head or guise donations the same would amount to charging of capitation fee The Governments appropriate authorities should consider framing appropriate regulations if not already framed whereunder if it is found that an institution is charging capitation fees or profiteering that institution can be appropriately penalised and also face the prospect of losing its recognition affiliation The <ORG> will be free to nominate co opt an independent person of repute in the field of education as well as one of the Vice Chancellors of the University in that <ORG> so that the total number of persons on the <ORG> do not exceed five The <ORG> shall have powers to oversee the tests to be conducted by the association This would include the power to call for the proposed question paper to know the names of the paper setters and examiners and to check the method adopted to ensure papers are not leaked The <ORG> shall supervise and ensure that the test is conducted in a fair and transparent manner The <ORG> shall have the powers to permit an institution which has been established and which has been permitted to adopt its own admission procedure for the last at least years to adopt its own admission procedure and if the <ORG> feels that the needs of such an institute are genuine to admit students of their community in excess of the quota allotted to them by <ORG> It is clarified that different percentage of quota for students to be admitted by the management in each minority or non minority unaided professional college shall be separately fixed on the basis of their need by the respective <ORG> Governments and in case of any dispute as regards fixation of percentage of quota it will be open to the management to approach the <ORG> It is also clarified that no institute which has not been established and which has not followed its own admission procedure for the last at least years shall be permitted to apply for or be granted exemption from admitting students in the manner set out hereinabove Nevertheless he made a reference to these <ORG> in his opinion and thus impliedly recorded his concurrence with the constitution of these <ORG> The aggrieved persons before us are again classifiable in one class that is unaided minority and non minority institutions imparting professional education The issues arising for decision before us are only three i the fixation of quota of admissions students in respect of unaided professional institutions ii the holding of examinations for admissions to such colleges that is who will hold the entrance tests and iii the fee structure The questions spelled out by Orders of Reference In the light of the two orders of reference referred to hereinabove we propose to confine our discussion to the questions set out hereunder which according to us arise for decision To what extent the <ORG> can regulate the admissions made by unaided minority or non minority educational institutions Can the <ORG> enforce its policy of reservation and or appropriate to itself any quota in admissions to such institutions Whether unaided minority and non minority educational institutions are free to devise their own admission procedure or whether direction made in <ORG> for compulsorily holding entrance test by the <ORG> or association of institutions and to choose therefrom the students entitled to admission in such institutions can be sustained in light of the law laid down in <ORG> Whether <ORG> could have issued guidelines in the matter of regulating the fee payable by the students to the educational institutions Can the admission procedure and fee structure be regulated or taken over by the Committees ordered to be constituted by <ORG> The issues posed before us are referable to headings and out of five headings formulated by <NAME> CJ in <ORG> So also speaking by reference to the questions framed in <ORG> the questions and answers relevant for us would be referable to question Nos a and We propose to place on record as briefly as we can the principal submissions made confined to the issues arising for decision before us Extensively reading various relevant paragraphs and observations in different opinions in <ORG> learned counsel contends that the directions for setting up permanent committees for regulating admissions and fixing fee structure in unaided minority and non minority institutions issued in the case of <ORG> are contrary to the ratio of judgment in <ORG> It is argued that in the judgment of the eleven judges in <ORG> which deals with several diverse issues of considerable complexity every observation has to be understood in its context It is submitted that taking over the right to regulate admission and fee structure of unaided professional institutions is not a reasonable restriction within the meaning of Article of the Constitution Such restriction is virtual negation of the constitutional protection of autonomy to minorities in running educational institutions of their choice as provided in Article of the Constitution Article permits <ORG> to make regulations and place reasonable restrictions in public interest upon the rights enjoyed by citizens under Article of the Constitution Any imposition of a system of selection of students for admission would be unreasonable if it deprives the private unaided institutions of the right of rational selection which it has devised for itself Subject to the minimum qualifications that may be prescribed and to some system of computing the equivalence between different kinds of qualifications like a common entrance test it can evolve a system of selection involving both written and oral tests based on principle of fairness Reference is made to paragraph of the judgment in <ORG> It is submitted that the <ORG> can prescribe minimum qualifications and may prescribe systems of computing equivalence in ascertaining merit however the right of rational selection which would necessarily involve the right to decide upon the method by which a particular institution computes such equivalence is protected by Article and infringement of this right constitutes an unreasonable encroachment upon the constitutionally guaranteed autonomy of such institutions It is further argued that where <ORG> take over the right of the institution to grant admission and or to fix the fees it constitutes nationalization of educational institutions Such nationalization of education is an unreasonable restriction on the right conferred under Article Reliance is placed on paragraph of the judgment in <ORG> Learned counsel further argues that schemes framed relating to grant of admission and fixing of fees in <NAME> has been held to be unconstitutional by the Judge Bench in <ORG> Reference is made to paragraph of the judgment in <ORG> It is submitted that the directions to set up committees for regulation of admission and fee structure in <ORG> virtually do the same exercise as was done in <NAME> and disapproved in the larger Bench decision in <ORG> The shortfall in the efforts of the <ORG> is met by the private enterprise that however does not entitle the <ORG> to nationalize whether in the whole or in part such private enterprise It is next argued that as held in <ORG> and re affirmed in <ORG> the right to establish and administer educational institutions by minorities under Article of the Constitution is not an absolute right meaning thereby that it is subject to such regulations that satisfy a dual test that is the test of reasonableness and any regulation regulating the educational character of the institutions so that it is conducive to making the institution an effective vehicle of education for the minority community and for the others who resort to it It is submitted that between the right of minorities to establish and administer the educational institutions and the right of the <ORG> to regulate educational activities for maintaining standard of education a balance has to be struck The regulation in relation to recognition affiliation operates in the area of standard of excellence and are unquestionable if they do not seriously curtail or destroy the right of minorities to administer their educational institutions This has been the constitutional interpretation of Article not because Article admits no exception like Article but because the right conferred under Article does not extend to these areas The laws that serve national interest do not impinge upon Article Article places a limitation on the right of an aided institution by providing that if <ORG> aid is obtained no citizen shall be denied admission on grounds only of religion race caste language or any of them It is submitted that as a necessary corollary no such limitation can be placed while regulating admission in an unaided minority institution which may prefer to admit students of minority community So far as unaided minority educational institutions are concerned the submission made is that government has no right or power much less duty to decide as to which method of selection of students is to be adopted by minority institutions No doubt the <ORG> is under a duty to prevent mal administration that is to control charging of capitation fees for the seats regardless of merit and commercializing education resulting in exploitation of students but to prevent mal administration of the above nature or on the ground that there is likelihood of such mal administration the <ORG> cannot take over the administration of the institutions themselves into its own hands An apprehension that a citizen may abuse his liberty does not provide justification for imposing restraints on the liberty of citizens Learned senior counsel <NAME> appearing on behalf of unaided <ORG> through its <ORG> of both categories of minority and non minority has questioned the correctness of the directions in the case of <ORG> for setting up permanent committees for fixation of quota and determination of fees In the case of <ORG> the ratio of <ORG> that autonomy of unaided non minority institutions is an important facet of their right under Article and in case of minority under Article read with Article of the Constitution has been ignored On behalf of unaided private professional colleges learned counsel further submitted that there are many private educational institutes which have been set up by people belonging to a region or a community or a class in order to promote their own groups The learned counsel raised very serious objections to the manner in which the various permanent committees set up in several States on the directions of <ORG> are conducting themselves and forcing their decisions on private institutions It is the <ORG> which has to decide whether the fees proposed by the institute are justified and do not amount to profiteering or charging of capitation fees The <ORG> has been given liberty to approve the fee structure of the institute or to propose a different fee structure The fee fixed by the <ORG> is binding for a period of three years and at the end of the said period the institute would be at liberty to apply for revision It is submitted that as decided in <ORG> by a larger <ORG> the essence of private educational institutions is the autonomy that the institution must have in its management and administration The right to establish and administer particularly comprises the right a to admit students and to set up reasonable fee structure The autonomy of the institution therefore predicates that all seats would be filled by the management and there can be no reservations or quotas in favour of the <ORG> In <ORG> the only observations made were that some colleges may be required to admit a small percentage of students belonging to weaker sections of the society by granting them freeships or scholarships It is submitted that autonomy of a private educational institution could mean that they can according to the objects and purposes of their institutions give preference to a particular class or group of students like <ORG> in <ORG> students from backward area in Bijapur college and transport employees children in Madras <ORG> Corporation Employees College or the children of employees of <ORG> in a college established by that company An institute should have the freedom to fix its own fee structure for day to day running of the institute and to generate funds for its further growth It is submitted that <ORG> contrary to the legal position explained in <ORG> could not set up in each <ORG> permanent committees headed by retired <ORG> Judges with the power to decide on the justification of the fee proposed by the institute and propose any other fees Learned senior counsel <NAME> also supported the submissions made by other counsel on behalf of the unaided professional institutions and added that the observations of the <ORG> in <ORG> clearly go far beyond anything said by eleven judges in <ORG> Learned senior counsel particularly pointed out that in <ORG> the observations that different percentage of quota for students to be admitted by the management in each minority and non minority unaided professional institutions shall be separately fixed on the basis of their need by the respective <ORG> Government was a totally new direction nowhere to be found or supported by any of the observations in any of the opinions of the Judge <ORG> in <ORG> With regard to the most controversial observations contained in paragraph of the opinion prepared by Justice <NAME> the then CJI in <ORG> learned counsel contended that the decision in <NAME> having been overruled by Judge <ORG> in <ORG> the observations in paragraph which are more in tune with <NAME> should not be read as the ratio of the case It is submitted that as a part of autonomy of the private unaided institution the quantum of fees to be charged must be left to the institution and except for checking profiteering and capitation fees the <ORG> can have no say in fixation of fees So far as fee structure is concerned no institution can be allowed to charge capitation fees which only means something taken over and above what the institution needs by way of revenue and capital expenditure plus a reasonable surplus It is submitted that it is only the essence of the reason or principle upon which the question before a court has been decided which is alone binding as a precedent Virtually the management of non aided institutions has been completely taken over by the state and as a result of communal reservations the quota of seats fixed for government and quota fixed for the management may be filled by granting admissions to students of non minority communities The object of establishing educational institution is not to make profit The charitable nature of the occupation of establishing and running an educational institution has been recognized in <ORG> It is submitted that restrictions imposed should satisfy the requirements of Article and not only of Article Counsel Dr <NAME> is that there is nothing in <ORG> which permits fixation of quotas for government seats fixation of fee structure by the <ORG> imposition of its reservation policy and imposition of candidates on the basis of common entrance test conducted by the <ORG> In <ORG> the <ORG> can have some controlling influence on unaided institutions for the purpose of ensuring transparency in admissions and checking the collection of capitation fee Apart from supporting the contention advanced by other counsel against the scheme of committees evolved in <ORG> learned counsel submitted that the judgment of <ORG> against which they have filed an appeal before this court has resulted in a situation where affluent students are getting admission at lesser fee and poorer students are kept out of college Objecting to the fee structure prescribed by the committees in Maharashtra the suggestion made on behalf of the institute is as under a students will be charged five times of the average fee which was in vogue before <ORG> judgment It may be noted at this stage that after the decisions in <ORG> and <ORG> in the States of Kerala Karnataka Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu their respective legislatures have passed Acts regulating admissions and charging of fee in both aided and unaided minority and non minority private educational institutions engaged in imparting education in professional medical engineering and allied courses On behalf of the State of Kerala it is pointed out that only seats in private professional colleges have been reserved to be filled on the basis of central entrance test and remaining seats are to be filled by the management It is on the line suggested by this court that <ORG> had made regulations both for the purpose of admissions as well as for fixing reasonable fee which will cover not only the expenditure incurred by the institution but also give them a reasonable revenue surplus for further growth and betterment of the institution Despite the students leaving the course mid way the seats would still be filled Similarly the court has struck down Regulation framed by the <ORG> on the ground that the <ORG> cannot foist fee of students on the institution and it would be left to the management to make provisions for poorer sections of the society through free ships or scholarships It is submitted that if there are certain inherent inconsistencies between various paragraphs particularly and of the judgment in <ORG> they have to be resolved and that was exactly what was done by the five judges in <ORG> It is submitted that if the attempt by the <ORG> in <ORG> to resolve the apparent inconsistency in the judgment of <ORG> indicated a reasonable and plausible interpretation of the Judge <ORG> judgment in <ORG> this court should refrain from substituting another interpretation All earlier judgments of this court were only concerning education in schools and colleges other than those imparting professional education For the first time in <ORG> the court held that running an educational institution is an occupation and Article guarantees it as a fundamental right Such regulation also does not violate right of minority professional institutions under Article which this <ORG> has repeatedly held is not an absolute right but is merely a protection extended to minorities against oppression by the majority The issue relating to reservation of seats for schedule castes schedule tribes or OBCs either in management quota or in <ORG> quota did not come up for consideration either in <ORG> or <ORG> This has to be separately dealt with by the present Bench Similarly it is submitted that right of minority institutions to admit students from all over the country irrespective of their religion and community and also from abroad such as NRIs never arose directly for consideration either in <ORG> or <ORG> In paragraph of the judgment in <ORG> the use of the phrase certain percentage based on local needs and further phrase different percentages can be fixed for minority unaided and non minority unaided professional colleges clearly convey that quotas can be fixed based on local needs for management and for the <ORG> So far as the selection based on merit is concerned common entrance test has been suggested both for aided and non aided professional colleges When there is no common entrance test merit becomes the casualty and the rich and the affluent corner the seats So far as the right to fix a fee structure for unaided minority or non minority colleges or institutes is concerned the argument that pre fixation of fee is a serious encroachment on the rights of minority and non minority it is submitted is not valid as full discretion is given to the management in fixing their fee structure If the committee is allowed to scrutinize the justification of fee fixation after the admissions and the fee is lowered it would not be possible for the meritorious students to again seek admission Through the Committees set up in <ORG> the fee structure would be known before hand and would serve the interest of the institution as also the students seeking admission The latter provided for marginally less merited rural or poor students bearing the burden of rich and urban students Each NRI student would subsidize two other students belonging to the economically and socially weaker sections based on an annual income of say less than rupees lacs A practical approach to the problem would require a very definite percentage to be fixed for minority institutions say so that even if candidates of their choice belonging to the minority institutions are only they would still have the right to select non minority students to make up the of course from the <ORG> held by the <ORG> The result of following this procedure is that a consortium holding the tests for admissions is done away with and a monitoring committee preferably headed by a retired <ORG> or <ORG> judge would ensure fairness and transparency both in the minority and non minority professional institutions Rights of minorities cannot be placed higher than the general welfare of the students and their right to take up professional education on the basis of their merit If running of educational institutions cannot be said to be at a higher plane than the right to carry on any other business reasonable restriction similar to those placed on the right to carry on business can be placed on educational institutions conducting professional courses For the purpose of these restrictions both minorities and non minorities can be treated at par and there would not be any violation of Article which guarantees only protection against oppression and discrimination of the minority from the majority On behalf of the <ORG> of Karnataka learned senior counsel <NAME> supported the judgment in <ORG> of setting up permanent Committees for regulating admission and fee structure The merit for admission to professional courses is generally determined by <ORG> agencies It is submitted that the educational institutions cannot merely read the answer to question no given by judgment in <ORG> and ignore the other observations in other paragraphs of the judgment It is submitted that the reservation spoken of in paragraph of <ORG> is to cater to the needs of poorer and weaker sections and also other students depending upon the local needs So far as the regulation of fee structure is concerned it is submitted that in paragraph in <ORG> there is a mention of appropriate machinery to be devised by the <ORG> or University to ensure that no capitation fee is charged and profiteering is checked In reply to the argument that post fixation audit may be permitted to check profiteering and capitation the learned counsel answers that if the role of the <ORG> is limited to supervisory post fixation audit it would amount to denying credible restriction to the charging of capitation fee It is chimerical to suggest that the student should first pay the exorbitant fee fixed by the institution and later on complain about it to the post audit machinery to recover the excess through court of law The general principle for scrutinizing the fee structure is two fold that education is a charity that educational institutions cannot charge such fee as is not required for the purpose of fulfilling that object which means cost plus reasonable surplus for expansion and growth of the institution So far as the admissions based on common entrance test are concerned it is submitted that paragraphs and of <ORG> permit regulations to be framed for admission in professional institutions by <ORG> agency to ensure admission on merit The <ORG> regulation providing for <ORG> is a reasonable restriction and it will pass the test of Article both in respect of aided and unaided non minority institutions Private unaided institutions have also to admit students on the basis of merit in a fair and transparent manner in the interest of student community Right of private educational institutions to admit students can be regulated Such regulations if in national and public interest do not in any manner impinge on the right of minority Learned counsel points out that so far as the State of Karnataka is concerned no reservation policy is being insisted upon in the seats or quota given to the management Arguments were also advanced supporting the directions in <ORG> by learned senior counsel <NAME> appearing for the <ORG> of Tamil Nadu Learned counsel pressed into service Article A providing for Fundamental Duties in the Constitution It is submitted that fundamental duty is enjoined on citizens to so direct their individual and collective activities that the nation constantly rises to higher levels of endeavour and achievement A few concepts There are a few concepts which should be very clear in our minds at the very outset as these are the concepts which flow as undercurrents in the sea of issues surfacing for resolution in all educational cases These concepts are referable to i What is education ii What is the inter relationship of Articles and of the Constitution iii In the context of minority educational institutions what difference does it make if they are aided or unaided or if they seek recognition or affiliation or do not do so iv Would it make any difference if the instructions imparted in such educational institutions relate to professional or non professional courses of study Education Education according to Chambers Dictionary is bringing up or training strengthening of the powers of body or mind culture It also connotes the whole course of scholastic instruction which a person has received What education connotes is the process of training and developing the knowledge skill mind and character of students by formal schooling Power then got associated with money and in th century it shifted its focus to mind ibid <NAME> <NAME> has well put it in his opinion in <ORG> para Education plays a cardinal role in transforming a society into a civilised nation Dr <NAME> sought to ensure that the seeds of knowledge were germinated in the minds of as many citizens as possible with a view to enabling them to perform their assigned roles on the stage of democracy Fundamental duties recognized by Article A include amongst others i to develop the scientific temper humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform and ii to strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity so that the nation constantly rises to higher levels of endeavour and achievement Articles and inter relationship between The right to establish an educational institution for charity or for profit being an occupation is protected by Article Notwithstanding the fact that the right of a minority to establish and administer an educational institution would be protected by Article yet the Founding Fathers of the Constitution felt the need of enacting Article Article is intended to instill confidence in minorities against any executive or legislative encroachment on their right to establish and administer educational institution of their choice But for Article an educational institution even though based on religion or language could have been controlled or regulated by law enacted under Clause of Article and so Article was enacted as a guarantee to the minorities that so far as the religious or linguistic minorities are concerned educational institutions of their choice will enjoy protection from such legislation However merely because Article has been enacted minority educational institutions do not become immune from the operation of regulatory measure because the right to administer does not include the right to mal administer The real purpose sought to be achieved by Article is to give minorities some additional protection Such a right is generally speaking subject to laws imposing reasonable restrictions in the interest of the general public In particular laws may be enacted on the following subjects i the professional or technical qualifications necessary for practicing any profession or carrying on any occupation trade or business ii the carrying on by the <ORG> or by a corporation owned or controlled by the <ORG> of any trade business industry or service whether to the exclusion complete or partial of citizens or otherwise Care is taken of minorities religious or linguistic by protecting their right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice under Article Therefore a minority educational institution has a right to admit students of its own choice it can as a matter of its own freewill admit students of non minority community The only restriction on the freewill of the minority educational institution admitting students belonging to non minority community is as spelt out by Article itself that the manner and number of such admissions should not be violative of the minority character of the institution Aid and affiliation or recognition both by <ORG> bring in some amount of regulation as a condition of receiving grant or recognition <NAME> case AIR SC and Judge Bench case in <ORG> must satisfy the following tests a the regulation is reasonable and rational it is regulative of the essential character of the institution and is conducive to making the institution an effective vehicle of education for the minority community or other persons who resort to it it is directed towards maintaining excellence of the education and efficiency of administration so as to prevent it from falling in standards <NAME> case and <ORG> go on to say that no regulation can be cast in the interest of the nation if it does not serve the interest of the minority as well This proposition except when it is read in the light of the opinion of <NAME> stands overruled in <ORG> where <NAME> CJ speaking for majority has ruled vide para any regulation framed in the national interest must necessarily apply to all educational institutions whether run by the majority or the minority Such a limitation must necessarily be read into Article Chief Justice <NAME> speaking for the majority in <ORG> took clue from the provisions of the <ORG> Reorganisation Act and held that in view of India having been divided into different linguistic <ORG>s carved out on the basis of the language of the majority of persons of that region it is the <ORG> and not the whole of India that shall have to be taken as the unit for determining linguistic minority viz a viz Article The principle would remain the same whether it is a <ORG> legislation or a <ORG> legislation dealing with linguistic or religious minority The population of the entire country is irrelevant for the purpose of determining such status However she refused to take the <ORG> as a unit for the purpose of determining minority status as in her opinion the question of minority status must be determined with reference to the country as a whole Whether a minority educational institution though established by a minority can cater to the needs of that minority only Can there be an enquiry to identify the person or persons who have really established the institution Can a minority institution provide cross border or inter State educational facilities and yet retain the character of minority educational institution In Kerala Education Bill the scope and ambit of right conferred by Article came up for consideration Article does not require that minorities based on religion should establish educational institutions for teaching religion only or that linguistic minority should establish educational institution for teaching its language only The object underlying Article is to see the desire of minorities being fulfilled that their children should be brought up properly and efficiently and acquire eligibility for higher university education and go out in the world fully equipped with such intellectual attainments as will make them fit for entering public services educational institutions imparting higher instructions including general secular education So long as the institution retains its minority character by achieving and continuing to achieve the above said two objectives the institution would remain a minority institution What will happen if the institution was receiving aid out of <ORG> funds The apparent conflict was resolved by the Judges employing a beautiful expression The learned Judges went on to observe that such sprinkling would enable the distinct language script and culture of a minority being propagated amongst non members of a particular minority community and that would indeed better serve the object of conserving the language religion and culture of that minority He said It matters not if a single philanthropic individual with his own means founds the institution or the community at large contributes the funds It is equally irrelevant that in addition to the minority community others from other minority communities or even from the majority community can take advantage of these institutions Such other communities bring in income and they do not have to be turned away to enjoy the protection The nature and content of these articles stands more than clarified and reconciled inter se as also with other articles if only we understand that these two articles are intended to confer protection on minorities rather than a right as such What would happen if a minority belonging to a particular <ORG> establishes an educational institution in that <ORG> and administers it but for the benefit of members belonging to that minority domiciled in the neighbouring <ORG> where that community is in majority Would it not be a fraud on the Constitution In St Stephen their Lordships had ruled that Article is a protective measure only for the benefit of religious and linguistic minorities and no illfit or camouflaged institution should get away with the constitutional protection para The question need not detain us for long as it stands answered in no uncertain terms in <ORG> Emphasising the need for preserving its minority character so as to enjoy the privilege of protection under Article it is necessary that the objective of establishing the institution was not defeated If so such an institution is under an obligation to admit the bulk of the students fitting into the description of the minority community Therefore the students of that group residing in the <ORG> in which the institution is located have to be necessarily admitted in a large measure because they constitute the linguistic minority group as far as that <ORG> is concerned The management bodies of such institutions cannot resort to the device of admitting the linguistic students of the adjoining <ORG> in which they are in a majority under the fagade of the protection given under Article If any other view was to be taken the very objective of conferring the preferential right of admission by harmoniously constructing Articles and may be distorted It necessarily follows from the law laid down in <ORG> that to establish a minority institution the institution must primarily cater to the requirements of that minority of that <ORG> else its character of minority institution is lost In Kerala Education Bill minority educational institutions came to be classified into three categories namely i those which do not seek either aid or recognition from the <ORG> ii those which want aid and iii those which want only recognition but not aid Once an educational institution is granted aid or aspires for recognition the <ORG> may grant aid or recognition accompanied by certain restrictions or conditions which must be followed as essential to the grant of such aid or recognition This Court clarified in Kerala Educational Bill that the right to establish and administer educational institutions conferred by Article does not include the right to mal administer and that is very obvious Merely because an educational institution belongs to minority it cannot ask for aid or recognition though running in unhealthy surroundings without any competent teachers and which does not maintain even a fair standard of teaching or which teaches matters subversive to the welfare of the scholars Therefore the <ORG> may prescribe reasonable regulations to ensure the excellence of the educational institutions to be granted aid or to be recognized The dividing line is that in the name of laying down conditions for aid or recognition the <ORG> cannot directly or indirectly defeat the very protection conferred by Article on the minority to establish and administer educational institutions Dealing with the third category of institutions which seek only recognition but not aid their Lordships held that the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice must mean the right to establish real institutions which will effectively serve the needs of the community and scholars who resort to these educational institutions The considerations for granting recognition to a minority educational institution and casting accompanying regulation would be similar as applicable to a non minority institution subject to two overriding considerations i the recognition is not denied solely on the ground of the educational institution being one belonging to minority and ii the regulation is neither aimed at nor has the effect of depriving the institution of its minority status However the terrain of thought as has developed through successive judicial pronouncements culminating in <ORG> is that looking at the concept of education in the backdrop of constitutional provisions the professional educational institutions constitute a class by themselves as distinguished from the educational institutions imparting non professional education It is not necessary for us to go deep into this aspect of the issue posed before us inasmuch as <ORG> has clarified that merit and excellence assume special significance in the context of professional studies Difference between professional and non professional education institutions Dealing with unaided minority educational institutions <ORG> holds that Article does not come in the way of the <ORG> stepping in for the purpose of securing transparency and recognition of merit in the matter of admissions Regulatory measures for ensuring educational standards and maintaining excellence thereof are no anathema to the protection conferred by Article However a distinction is to be drawn between unaided minority educational institution of the level of schools and undergraduate colleges on one side and the institutions of higher education in particular those imparting professional education on the other side There could be regulatory measures for ensuring educational standards and maintaining excellence thereof The source of this distinction between two types of educational institutions referred to hereinabove is to be found in the principle that right to administer does not include a right to mal administer Educational institutions imparting higher education i graduate level and above and in particular specialized education such as technical or professional constitutes a separate class While embarking upon resolving issues of constitutional significance where the letter of the Constitution is not clear we have to keep in view the spirit of the Constitution as spelt out by its entire scheme Graduate level study is a doorway to admissions in educational institutions imparting professional or technical or other higher education and therefore at that level the considerations akin to those relevant for professional or technical educational institutions step in and become relevant A number of legislations occupying the field of education whose constitutional validity has been tested and accepted suggest that while recognition or affiliation may not be a must for education up to undergraduate level or even if required may be granted as a matter of routine recognition or affiliation is a must and subject to rigorous scrutiny when it comes to educational institutions awarding degrees graduate or post graduate post graduate diplomas and degrees in technical or professional disciplines Having so stated and clarified these principles which would be germane to answering the four questions posed before us now we take up each of the four questions seriatim and answer the same I It would be unfair to apply the same rules and regulations regulating admission to both aided and unaided professional institutions It must be borne in mind that unaided professional institutions are entitled to autonomy in their administration while at the same time they do not forego or discard the principle of merit It would therefore be permissible for the university or the <ORG> at the time of granting recognition to require a private unaided institution to provide for merit based selection while at the same time giving the management sufficient discretion in admitting students This can be done through various methods II For instance a certain percentage of the seats can be reserved for admission by the management out of those students who have passed the common entrance test held by itself or by the <ORG> university and have applied to the college concerned for admission while the rest of the seats may be filled up on the basis of counselling by the <ORG> agency This will incidentally take care of poorer and backward sections of the society The prescription of percentage for this purpose has to be done by the <ORG> according to the local needs and different percentages can be fixed for minority unaided and non minority unaided and professional colleges The same principles may be applied to other non professional but unaided educational institutions viz In such professional unaided institutions the management will have the right to select teachers as per the qualifications and eligibility conditions laid down by the <ORG> university subject to adoption of a rational procedure of selection A rational fee structure should be adopted by the management which would not be entitled to charge a capitation fee Appropriate machinery can be devised by the <ORG> or university to ensure that no capitation fee is charged and that there is no profiteering though a reasonable surplus for the furtherance of education is permissible Conditions granting recognition or affiliation can broadly cover academic and educational matters including the welfare of students and teachers It is well established all over the world that those who seek professional education must pay for it The number of seats available in government and government aided colleges is very small compared to the number of persons seeking admission to the medical and engineering colleges All those eligible and deserving candidates who could not be accommodated in government colleges would stand deprived of professional education This void in the field of medical and technical education has been filled by institutions that are established in different places with the aid of donations and the active part taken by public minded individuals The object of establishing an institution has thus been to provide technical or professional education to the deserving candidates and is not necessarily a commercial venture At the school level the recognition or affiliation has to be sought from the educational authority or the body that conducts the school leaving examination It is only on the basis of that examination that a school leaving certificate is granted which enables a student to seek admission in further courses of study after school A college or a professional educational institution has to get recognition from the university concerned which normally requires certain conditions to be fulfilled before recognition It has been held that conditions of affiliation or recognition which pertain to the academic and educational character of the institution and ensure uniformity efficiency and excellence in educational courses are valid and that they do not violate even the provisions of Article of the Constitution but conditions that are laid down for granting recognition should not be such as may lead to governmental control of the administration of the private educational institutions However we have reproduced para by dividing it into two parts A reading of the majority judgment in <ORG> in its entirety supports the conclusion that while the first part of para is law laid down by the majority the second part is only by way of illustration tantamounting to just a suggestion or observation as to how the <ORG> may devise a possible mechanism so as to take care of poor and backward sections of the society Such submissions forcefully advanced at the <ORG> have been kept in view by us while reading the several opinions in <ORG> and <ORG> It was urged that the task was difficult and unwittingly for the sake of aiming at brevity certain omissions have taken place Illustratively it was pointed out that vide para of <ORG> <NAME> CJ has said Merit is usually determined for admission to professional and higher education colleges by either the marks that the student obtains at the qualifying examination or school leaving certificate stage followed by the interview or by a common entrance test conducted by the institution or in the case of professional colleges by government agencies emphasis by us In <ORG> vide para sub para i a the abovesaid passage has been quoted as under Admission to professional colleges should be based on merit by a common entrance test conducted by the government agencies emphasis by us It was pointed out that <ORG> vide para was just making a note of what is prevailing as the usual systems for admitting students but <ORG> vide para gives an impression that the view taken in <ORG> is to confine to common entrance test conducted by the government agencies as the only source of admission to professional colleges While expressing their appreciation of the task performed in <ORG> of attempting resolution of several issues raised post <ORG> the learned counsel addressing us have tried to put across and demonstrate several such anomalies which <ORG> read in juxta position with <ORG> has raised We cull out and state what <ORG> has to say about such category of institutions i Minority educational institution unaided and unrecognized <ORG> is unanimous on the view that the right to establish and administer an institution the phrase as employed in Article of the Constitution comprises of the following rights a to admit students to set up a reasonable fee structure to constitute a governing body to appoint staff teaching and non teaching and to take action if there is dereliction of duty on the part of any of the employees Obviously such institutions would fall in the category of those who would exercise their right under the protection and privilege conferred by Article to their hearts content unhampered by any restrictions excepting those which are in national interest based on considerations such as public safety national security and national integrity or are aimed at preventing exploitation of students or teaching community The essential ingredients of the management including admission of students recruiting of staff and the quantum of fee to be charged cannot be regulated para <ORG> Apart from the generalized position of law that right to administer does not include right to mal administer an additional source of power to regulate by enacting condition accompanying affiliation or recognition exists Balance has to be struck between the two objectives i that of ensuring the standard of excellence of the institution and ii that of preserving the right of the minority to establish and administer its educational institution Subject to reconciliation of the two objectives any regulation accompanying affiliation or recognition must satisfy the triple tests i the test of resonableness and rationality ii the test that the regulation would be conducive to making the institution an effective vehicle of education for the minority community or other persons who resort to it and iii that there is no in road on the protection conferred by Article of the Constitution that is by framing the regulation the essential character of the institution being a minority educational institution is not taken away para <ORG> iii Minority educational institutions receiving State aid Conditions which can normally be permitted to be imposed on the educational institutions receiving the grant must be related to the proper utilization of the grant and fulfillment of the objectives of the grant without diluting the minority status of the educational institution as held in <ORG> See para thereof As aided institutions are not before us and we are not called upon to deal with their cases we leave the discussion at that only We find great force in the submission made on behalf of the petitioners that the <ORG>s have no power to insist on seat sharing in the unaided private professional educational institutions by fixing a quota of seats between the management and the <ORG> The <ORG> cannot insist on private educational institutions which receive no aid from the <ORG> to implement <ORG> policy on reservation for granting admission on lesser percentage of marks i on any criterion except merit As per our understanding neither in the judgment of <ORG> nor in the <ORG> decision in <ORG> which was approved by <ORG> there is anything which would allow the <ORG> to regulate or control admissions in the unaided professional educational institutions so as to compel them to give up a share of the available seats to the candidates chosen by the <ORG> as if it was filling the seats available to be filled up at its discretion in such private institutions Merely because the resources of the <ORG> in providing professional education are limited private educational institutions which intend to provide better professional education cannot be forced by the <ORG> to make admissions available on the basis of reservation policy to less meritorious candidate A few observations contained in certain paragraphs of the judgment in <ORG> if read in isolation appear conflicting or inconsistent with each other But if the observations made and the conclusions derived are read as a whole the judgment nowhere lays down that unaided private educational institutions of minorities and non minorities can be forced to submit to seat sharing and reservation policy of the <ORG> There are also observations saying that they may frame their own policy to give free ships and scholarships to the needy and poor students or adopt a policy in line with the reservation policy of the state to cater to the educational needs of weaker and poorer sections of the society Nowhere in <ORG> either in the majority or in the minority opinion have we found any justification for imposing seat sharing quota by the <ORG> on unaided private professional educational institutions and reservation policy of the <ORG> or <ORG> quota seats or management seats In <ORG> it has been very clearly held at several places that unaided professional institutions should be given greater autonomy in determination of admission procedure and fee structure It is common knowledge that some of the institutions grant admissions to certain number of students under such quota by charging a higher amount of fee In effect and reality under this category less meritorious students but who can afford to bring more money get admission Minority institutions are free to admit students of their own choice including students of non minority community as also members of their own community from other <ORG>s both to a limited extent only and not in a manner and to such an extent that their minority educational institution status is lost So far as the minority unaided institutions are concerned to admit students being one of the components of right to establish and administer an institution the <ORG> cannot interfere therewith Whether minority or non minority institutions there may be more than one similarly situated institutions imparting education in any one discipline in any State There is nothing wrong in an entrance test being held for one group of institutions imparting same or similar education <ORG> is necessary in the interest of achieving the said objectives and also for saving the student community from harassment and exploitation Holding of such common entrance test followed by centralized counseling or in other words single window system regulating admissions does not cause any dent in the right of minority unaided educational institutions to admit students of their choice All institutions imparting same or similar professional education can join together for holding a common entrance test satisfying the abovesaid triple tests The <ORG> can also provide a procedure of holding a common entrance test in the interest of securing fair and merit based admissions and preventing mal administration Fee regulation of To set up a reasonable fee structure is also a component of the right to establish and administer an institution within the meaning of Article of the Constitution as per the law declared in <ORG> While in business and to a certain extent in occupation there is a profit motive profession is primarily a service to society wherein earning is secondary or incidental Despite the legal position this <ORG> cannot shut its eyes to the hard realities of commercialization of education and evil practices being adopted by many institutions to earn large amounts for their private or selfish ends If capitation fee and profiteering is to be checked the method of admission has to be regulated so that the admissions are based on merit and transparency and the students are not exploited Vide para Chief Justice <NAME> has clearly ruled that the decision in <NAME> insofar as it framed the scheme relating to the grant of admission and the fixing of the fee was not correct and to that extent the said decision and the consequent directions given to <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> the <ORG> and <ORG> etc Vide para <ORG> upheld <NAME> to the extent to which it holds the right to primary education as a fundamental right but the scheme was overruled Leverage was allowed to educational institutions to generate reasonable surplus to meet cost of expansion and augmentation of facilities which would not amount to profiteering The learned senior counsel appearing for different private professional institutions who have questioned the scheme of permanent Committees set up in the judgment of <ORG> very fairly do not dispute that even unaided minority institutions can be subjected to regulatory measures with a view to curb commercialization of education profiteering in it and exploitation of students The two committees for monitoring admission procedure and determining fee structure in the judgment of <ORG> are in our view permissive as regulatory measures aimed at protecting the interest of the student community as a whole as also the minorities themselves in maintaining required standards of professional education on non exploitative terms in their institutions Legal provisions made by <ORG> or the scheme evolved by the <ORG> for monitoring admission procedure and fee fixation do not violate the right of minorities under Article or the right of minorities and non minorities under Article The suggestion made on behalf of minorities and non minorities that the same purpose for which <ORG> have been set up can be achieved by post audit or checks after the institutions have adopted their own admission procedure and fee structure is unacceptable for the reasons shown by experience of the educational authorities of various States Professional education should be made accessible on the criterion of merit and on non exploitative terms to all eligible students on an uniform basis Minorities or non minorities in exercise of their educational rights in the field of professional education have an obligation and a duty to maintain requisite standards of professional education by giving admissions based on merit and making education equally accessible to eligible students through a fair and transparent admission procedure and on a reasonable fee structure In our considered view on the basis of judgment in <ORG> and various previous judgments of this <ORG> which have been taken into consideration in that case the scheme evolved of setting up the two Committees for regulating admissions and determining fee structure by the judgment in <ORG> cannot be faulted either on the ground of alleged infringement of Article in case of unaided professional educational institutions of both categories and Article read with Article in case of unaided professional institutions of minorities However we would like to sound a note of caution to such <ORG> The learned counsel appearing for the petitioners have severely criticised the functioning of some of the <ORG> so constituted It was pointed out by citing concrete examples that some of the <ORG> have indulged in assuming such powers and performing such functions as were never given or intended to be given to them by <ORG> Retired <ORG> Judges heading the <ORG> are assisted by experts in accounts and management They also have the benefit of hearing the contending parties On Question our conclusion therefore is that the judgment in <ORG> in so far as it evolves the scheme of two Committees one each for admission and fee structure does not go beyond the law laid down in <ORG> and earlier decisions of this Court which have been approved in that case Epilogue We have answered the four questions formulated by us in the manner indicated hereinabove All other issues which we leave untouched may be dealt with by the regular Benches which will take up individual cases for decision We have placed on record in the earlier part of this judgment and yet before parting we would like to reiterate that certain recitals certain observations and certain findings in <ORG> are contradictory inter se and such conflict can only be resolved by a Bench of a coram larger than <ORG> There are several questions which have remained unanswered and there are certain questions which have propped up post <ORG> and <ORG> Issues referable to those areas which are already covered by <ORG> and yet open to question shall have to be answered by a Bench of a larger coram than <ORG> We leave those issues to be taken care of by posterity This judgment shall not have the effect of disturbing the admissions already made or with regard to which the process has already commenced The law as laid down in this judgment shall be given effect to from the academic year commencing next after the pronouncement of this judgment Needless to say any decision taken by such Committees and by the <ORG> or <ORG> shall be open to judicial review in accordance with the settled parameters for the exercise of such jurisdiction Before parting we would like to place on record our appreciation of the valuable assistance rendered by all the learned senior counsel and other counsel appearing in the case and who have addressed us highlighting very many aspects of the ticklish issues in the field of professional education which have propped up for decision in the light of the <ORG> decision in <ORG> and <ORG> decision in <ORG> All the petitions Civil Appeals and IAs shall now be listed before appropriate Benches for hearing
