In view of the finding as to the nature of the discharge set up by the st defendant the only question is whether there is any objection to a suit by the plaintiff for his share In the circumstances of the case I think there is no objection The petition is dismissed with costs That being so the only question is whether the plaintiff suit for his share of the debt can be sustained he having made his co partners defendants in the action No doubt the general rule is that one partner can give a valid discharge of a debt due to his partnership but that rule has no application if the discharge so given is in fraud of the aggrieved partner and is the result of collusion between the partner giving a discharge and the debtor This petition must be dismissed with costs
