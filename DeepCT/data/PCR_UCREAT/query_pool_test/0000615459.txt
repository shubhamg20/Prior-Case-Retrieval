The defendants have come up in appeal feeling aggrieved by the order dated passed by a learned Single Judge of this Court Original Side confirming the ex parte order of injunction and rejecting the defendants application for vacation of the ex parte order of injunction dated in a trade mark case Ever since they have been marketing their preparations under their trade mark and figures of sales have risen from Rs There are a good number of medicines already in the market associated with treatment of liver ailments disorders using the word Liv as suggestive of liver and prefixing or suffixing words or figures so as to confer a distinction on the name associated with the manufacturer or trader It is submitted by the defendant that mark Liv is neither similar to nor deceptive with the plaintiff mark Liv It has become public juris on which no one can claim proprietory rights or right to exclusive use The following questions arise for decision Whether the trade mark LIV can be said to be deceptively similar to or confusing with the trade mark LIV Whether the provisions of Order Rule are mandatory If so what is the effect of non compliance therewith Before dealing with the contentions of the parties we may refer to a few statutory provisions and settled principles in the field of trade marks First we may refer to a few provisions of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act A trade mark is a mark used or proposed to be used in relation to goods for the purpose of indicating or so as to indicate a connection in the course of trade between the goods and some person having the right to use the mark A mark shall be deemed to be deceptively similar to another mark if it so nearly resembles that other mark as to be likely to deceive ar cause confusion A mark the use of which would be likely to deceive or cause confusion is prohibited from being registered Their Lordships have then stated the law for the Courts faced with an action for infringement of a trade mark and laid down the following principles Where the two marks are identical no further questions arise for then the infringement is made out When the two marks are not identical the plaintiff would have to establish that the mark used by the defendant so nearly resembles the plaintiff registered trade mark as is likely to deceive or cause confusion and in relation to goods in respect of which it is registered The onus would be on the plaintiff The court has to compare that two marks the degree of resemblance which is necessary to exist to cause deception not being capable of definition by laying down objective standard The ultimate test is whether the mark used by the defendant as a whole is deceptively similar to that of the registered mark of the plaintiff The resemblance may be phonetic visual or in the basic idea represented by the plaintiff mark The identification of the essential features of the mark is in essence a question of fact and depends on the judgment of the <ORG> based on evidence led before it as regards the usage of the trade ii In a passing off action the issue is Is the defendant selling goods so marked as to be designed or calculated to lead purchasers to believe that they are the plaintiff goods iii In an infringement action the issue is Is the defendant using a mark which is the same as or which is colourable imitation of the plaintiff registered trade mark iv The element of deception or confusion becomes irrelevant in the second issue as the same is implicit inherent or presumed to be present One need not place side by side the two to find out if there are any differences in the design and if so whether they are of such character as to prevent one from being mistaken for the other Their Lordships have held that an ordinary purchaser is not gifted with the powers of observation of <NAME> and cited with approval the following statement from Karly Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names th edition paragraph Two marks when placed side by side may exhibit many and various differences yet the main idea left on the mind by both may be the same A person acquainted with one mark and not having the two side by side for comparison might well be deceived if the goods were allowed to be impressed with the second mark into a belief that he was dealing with goods which before the same mark as that with which he was dealing with goods which bore the same mark as that with he was acquainted Thus for example a mark may represent a game of football another mark may show players in a different dress and in very different positions and yet the idea conveyed by each might be simply a game of football It could be too much to expect that persons dealing with trade marked goods and replying as they frequently do upon marks should be able to remember the exact details of the marks upon goods with which they are in the habit of dealing Marks are remembered rather by general impressions or by some significant recollection of the whole Moreover variations in detail might well be supposed by customers to have been made by the owners of the trade mark they are already acquainted with for reasons for their own If the proprietor is not in a position to use the mark to distinguish his goods from those of others or has abandoned it or the mark has become so common in the market that it has ceased to connect him with his goods there remains no jurisdiction in retaining it on the register The distinctiveness of the trade mark in relation to the goods of a registered proprietor of such a trade mark may be lost in a variety of ways by the goods not being capable of being distinguished as the goods of such a proprietor or by extensive piracy so that the marks become public juris In <ORG> case supra <NAME> said the eye of the judge is the final arbiter but the Judge must not use if the expression be allowed his own eyes he has got to look at the articles with the eyes of the public who may be expected to buy those articles especially when the people who buy those articles include people of all classes including many persons living in the jungle uneducated illiterate and who may be regarded as equivalent to the incautious ignorant or unwary up country purchasers In arriving at the conclusion of fact as to whether deception or confusion is likely the court will have regard to a the nature and extent of the reputation relied upon the closeness or otherwise of the respective fields of activity in which the plaintiff and the defendant carry on business the similarity of the mark name etc used by the defendant to that of the plaintiff the manner in which the defendant makes use of the name mark etc In assessing whether confusion or deception is likely the court attaches importance to the question as to whether the defendant can be shown to have acted with a fraudulent intent although a fraudulent intent is not a necessary part of the cause of action Evidence may be called on the point but is not essential except in cases of doubt and the assistance it gives to the <ORG> will be of a limited nature unless it includes evidence of actual deception The learned counsel for the defendant appellant submitted that there are two very important relevant considerations which must be kept in view in deciding the case at hand The learned counsel has cited a host of authorities in support of his submission that a word or its abbreviation having become public juris ceases to be subject matter of proprietorship also ceases to be source of deception ar confusion for the person likely to deal with such goods would ignore the public juris and go distinguishing the products by the prefixes and or suffixes It is not that airy man in the street would just reach the counter in a shop ask for the goods by spelling out the trade mark and the salesman would hand over one or the other of the two goods which would be carried away by the unwary customer unmindful of what he intended to purchase and what he in fact got into his hands We find merit in both the contentions so advanced Any symbol word or get up commonly used by traders in connection with their trade and in respect of which no particular trader can claim an exclusive right to use may be considered common to that particular trade or public juris or devices which are descriptive of particular goods are open to use by all persons engaged in the trade What is important is that the trading public has a right to use them in connection with their business A word or words used by a number of firms as part of their designation may be considered as words in common use See Law of Trade Mark and Passing Off Narayanan th Edn We would first deal with the cases generally associated with this aspect and then pass over to the medicinal cases arising in the field of medicinal and pharmaceutical preparations Now it is well recognised principle that has to be taken into account in considering the possibility of confusion arising between any two trade marks that where those two marks contain a common element which is also contained in a number of other marks in use in the same market such a common occurrence in the market tends to cause purchasers to pay more attention to the other features of the respective marks and to distinguish between them by those features This principle clearly requires that the marks comprising the common element shall be in fairly extensive use and as I have mentioned in use in the market in which the marks under consideration are being on will be used The two trade marks were used in respect of electrical and electronic apparatus Their Lordships held that micro chip technology being the base of many of the products the word Micro has much relevance in describing the products It was descriptive of the micro technology used for production of many electronic goods which daily come to the market No one can claim monopoly over the use of the said word Anyone producing any product with the use of micro chip technology would be justified in using the said word as a prefix to his trade name There is not even the remotest chance of the buyers and users being misguided or confused by the two trade names and logos Same is the case with the carton which merely reproduces both the trade names and the logos Their Lordships then concluded If it be viewed simply as a word mark consisting COCA and COLA joined by a hyphen and the fact be borne in mind that COLA is a word in common use in Canada in naming beverages it is plain that the distinctive feature in the hyphenated word is the first word Coca and not Cola It is difficult indeed impossible to imagine that the mark <ORG> Cola as used by the defendant in which the distinctive feature is for the same reason the first word <ORG> and not Cola would lead anyone to confuse it with the registered mark of the plaintiff The trade mark used by the defendant and the registered mark of the plaintiff are not trade marks so nearly resembling each other or so clearly suggesting the idea conveyed by each other that the contemporaneous use of both in the same area in association with wares of the same kind would be likely to cause dealers in or users of such wares to infer that the same person assumed responsibility for their character or quality or for the conditions under which or the class of persons by whom they were produced or for their place of origin Their Lordships held When the two words in question in this case are first looked at and regarded as made up words as they in fact are their reason and virtue may elude the mind but when it is recognised that both are intended to be used in connection with aluminium hydroxide or a substance substantially composed of aluminum hyproxide and also a substance which is considered or counted as a gel it is seen that both words are intended to convey by their characteristics an indication of what it is that is being sold We may now proceed to notice a few cases in the filed of medicines and pharmaceuticals VIT is a well known abbreviation used in pharmaceutical trade to denote vitamin preparation Their Lordships held If greater regard is paid to the uncommon element in these two words it is difficult to hold that one will be mistaken for or confused with the other The letters and in DROPOVIT and the corresponding letters and in PROTOVIT cannot possibly be slurred over in pronunciation and the words are so dissimilar that there is no reasonable probability of confusion between the words either from the visual or phonetic point of view Evidence was adduced to show that the word Seltzer was having general usage in the trade and there were several trade mark using a prefix to the word Seltzer and available in the market It was held If the fact be borne in mind that the distinctive feature of the mark ALKASELTZER is the first word Alka and not Seltzer Alka rather than SELTZER is what would remain in the average memory Their Lordship held It is quite obvious that once you get a statutory regulation of the channels of supply is essential that the court in considering the possibilities of deception should be taken into account the extent to which such a possibility is minimised or perhaps obliterated altogether by the statutory regulations What we are concerned with are not unlikely cases which may happen once in one hundred years but reasonable probabilities and we have to ask ourselves in relation to those facts Is there such a risk that a doctor or a chemist or the two of them in combination by some carelessness in expression some obscurity in handwriting some slip of recollection or some careless mistake which you would not expect highly trained professional people to fail into will refer to the product in such a way as will lead the court to say that there is a reasonable probability of confusion It seems to me that if one is really to give weight to such a risk it involves attributing to those highly skilled experienced and careful people to whom the <ORG> has entrusted and to whom alone the <ORG> has entrusted the precautions necessary under the Poisons Act qualities of carelessness or incompetence which although may exist in a person here and there on occasions that of course cannot be denied are not usually found in that class of persons One of the relevant considerations kept in view by the DB vide para was that the goods being Schedule drugs were obtainable only on doctor prescription It was further held that there was no phonetic similarity and there was no cause for confusion there were several medicinal oils using THENNAMARAKKUDI a geographical name as part of trade mark It was held that word having become public juris nobody could claim any exclusive right to its use We may briefly refer to several other cases throwing light on the point However a few additional considerations arise when dealing with cases of such drugs which cannot be sold except on prescription of a doctor and which are sold only by such persons who have special knowledge or expertise in the field Nobody can claim exclusive right to use any word abbreviation or acronym which has become public juris If the two trade marks by two competing traders use a generic word or an expression public juris common to both the trade marks it has to be seen if the customers who purchase the goods would be guided by the use of such word expression or would ignore it and give emphasis to prefixes or suffixes or words used in association therewith Nobody can claim an exclusive right to the use of Liv as a constituent of any trade mark The possibility of deception or confusion is reduced practically to nil in view of the fact that the medicine will be sold on medical prescription and by licensed dealers well versed in the field and having knowledge of medicines Having examined the two cartons we are clearly of the opinion that there is no possibility of one being accused of deceptively similar with the other and the likely customer mistaking one with the other even by recollecting faint impressions Sufficient it to observe that it was in the facts and circumstances of each of the above said cases that the defendant trade name trade mark was found to be offending and hence restrained Therein also their Lordships have held The act does not lay down any criteria for determining what is likely to deceive or cause confusion within the meaning of Section and Section Therefore every case must depend on its own particular facts and the value of authorities lies not so much in the actual decision as in the tests applied for determining what is likely to deceive or cause confusion For deceptive resemblance two important questions are who are the persons whom the resemblance must be likely to deceive or confuse and what rules of comparison are to be adopted in judging whether such resemblance exists As to confusion it is perhaps an appropriate description of the state of mind of a customer who on seeing a mark thinks that it differs from the mark on goods which he had previously bought but is doubtful whether that impression is not due to imperfect recollection Their Lordships formed an opinion that the use of the word DHARA was not of itself decisive of the matter in the facts found in that case However we would like to deal with the plea raised on behalf of the defendant appellant before us just as it was raised before the learned Single Judge though unsuccessfully demanding instantaneous vacating of the ex parte order of injunction even without going into the merits of the case solely because the plaintiff respondent had failed to discharge its obligation mandatorily cast by the proviso to Rule of Order of <ORG> The defendant through their attorneys have made repeated telephone calls to the office of the attorneys of the plaintiff despite which the plaintiff till date has supplied the defendant with a complete set A copy of the said letter was also delivered personally to Mr <NAME> office The said set does not even have a complete index and there are only pages in the same The injunction granted in favour of the plaintiff is liable to set aside on this ground alone Rule carves out an exception in favour of granting an injunction without notice to the opposite party where it appears that the object of granting injunction would be defeated by the delay Conferment of this privilege on the party seeking an injunction is accompanied by an obligation cast on the court to record reasons for its opinion and an obligation cast on the applicant to comply with the requirements of Clauses a and of the proviso Though the observations have been made primarily on the obligation of the <ORG> to record the reasons but in our opinion they equally apply to the obligation cast on the applicant by the proviso Their Lordships have observed The imperative nature of the proviso has to be judged in the context of Rule of Order of the Code Before the proviso aforesaid was introduced Rule said the court shall in all cases except where it appears that the object of granting the injunction would be defeated by the delay before granting an injunction direct notice of the application for the same to be given to the opposite party The proviso was introduced to provide a condition where court proposes to grant an injunction without giving notice of the application to the opposite party being of the opinion that the subject of granting injunction itself shall be defeated by delay The condition so introduced is that the court shall record the reasons why an ex parte order of injunction was being passed in the facts and circumstances of a particular case In this background the requirement for recording the reasons for grant of ex parte injunction cannot be held to be a mere formality This requirement is consistent with the principle that a party to a suit who is being restrained from exercising a right which such party claims to exercise either under a statute or under the common law must be informed why instead of following the requirement of Rule the procedure prescribed under the proviso has been followed The party which invokes the jurisdiction of the court for grant of an order of restraint against a party without affording an opportunity to him of being heard must satisfy the court about the gravity of the situation and court has to consider briefly these factors in the ex parte order We are quite conscious of the fact that there are other statutes which contain similar provisions requiring the court or the authorities concerned to record reasons before exercising power vested in them But same cannot be said in respect of the proviso to Rule of Order Such ex parte orders have far reaching effect as such a condition has been imposed that court must record reasons before passing such order Proviso to Rule of Order of the Code attracts the principle that if a statute requires a thing to be done in a particular manner it should be done in that manner or not all We are of the opinion that if the court is satisfied of non compliance by the applicant with the provisions contained in the proviso then on being so satisfied the court which was persuaded to grant an ex parte ad interim injunction confiding in the applicant that having been shown indulgence by the court he would comply with the requirements of the proviso it would simply vacate the ex parte order of injunction without expressing any opinion of the merits of the case leaving it open to the parties to have a hearing on the grant or otherwise on the order of injunction but bi part only
