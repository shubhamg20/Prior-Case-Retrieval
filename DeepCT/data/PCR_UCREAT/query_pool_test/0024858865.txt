Whether Reporters of Local newspapers may be allowed to see the Judgment The employees of <ORG> are divided into two categories viz This ceiling was further raised to Rs lakhs with effect from and according to the petitioners it was applicable to all Government employees of <ORG> Another grievance of the Petitioner is that the ceiling on gratuity is applicable only to those employees who are in Executive cadre and there is no ceiling in case of non executive employees It has also been alleged by the respondent that Executives being Officers Managers at various levels are different and distinct class compared to non executives who constitute workmen It has also been stated that Executive enjoys several benefits and allowances which are not available to non executives and there cannot be any comparison since the two are distinct class categories It has further been stated in Counter Affidavit that vide Government of India Ordinance dated under payment of Gratuity Act the amount of ceiling was increased from Rs lakh to Rs lakhs and further vide Payment of Gratuity Amendment Act dated the ceiling was raised to Rs lakhs Section of the Payment of Gratuity Act provides that for every completed year of service or part thereof in excess of six months the employer shall pay gratuity to an employee at the rate of days wages based on the rate of wages last drawn by the employee concerned Sub section of Section before its amendment with effect from provided that the amount of gratuity payable to an employee shall not exceed Rs Section of the Payment of Gratuity Act reads as under Nothing in this section shall affect the right of an employee to receive better terms of gratuity under any award or agreement or contract with the employer Thus despite the upper sealing prescribed by sub section the employees are entitled to receive higher gratuity if it is so agreed under any award or an agreement or contract between the employer and the employees The counter affidavit shows that a Memorandum of Agreement of Joint Wage Negotiating Committee for steel industry signed in October provided that there was to be no ceiling or limit on the amount of gratuity payable Thus in view of the agreement between the respondent and its workmen there is no ceiling on the amount of gratuity payable to the non executive employees and such an agreement is specifically permitted by Section of the Payment of Gratuity Act So long as there is a subsisting agreement between the respondents and its non executive employees to the effect that there will be no ceiling on the gratuity payable to the workmen and such an agreement is permissible in law no fault can be found with the respondent treating its employees forming part of executive cadres differently from the employees who are workmen in the matter of Payment of Gratuity Even otherwise the employees who are workmen constitute an altogether different class from the employees who are Managers and officers being members of various executive cadres of the respondent company Differential treatment based on intelligible differentia is permissible under the Constitution so long as it has a reasonable nexus with the objective sought to be achieved in this behalf Since the employees forming part of managerial cadres belong altogether to a different class they cannot claim as a matter of right the same treatment which is given to the non executive employees on account of a binding agreement between them and the respondent company The issue of differential treatment to executive and non executive employees in the matter of payment of gratuity came up for consideration before this court in CWP No decided on September This court after considering the provisions of Payment of Gratuity Act and the agreement of the respondent with its non executive employees repelled the contentions that fixation of higher gratuity to the non executive class under the agreement was inconsistent with the provisions of the Payment of Gratuity Act This court also held that the two categories namely the executives and the non executives belong to two different and distinct classes and there was a rationale relationship with the object sought to be achieved in extending better terms of gratuity to the non executive employees in pursuance of the agreement and in terms of sub section of Section of the Payment of Gratuity Act The respondent amended its Gratuity Rules as and when there was amendment in the provisions of the Payment of Gratuity Act and those rules applied to all employees irrespective of whether they are from executive cadres or from non executive cadres For the reasons given above I find no merit in the contention that the executives are entitled to Payment of Gratuity without any ceiling as is being paid to the non executive employees lakhs with effect from st January and the enhanced ceiling was applicable not only to <ORG> employees but also to the employees of public sector undertakings enterprises I find that the petitioner has not placed on record any order or notification of <ORG> revising the ceiling for payment of gratuity to the employees of all the public sector undertakings to Rs The respondent is a company duly registered under Companies Act and it has framed its own Rules in the matter of Payment of Gratuity to its employees The employees of the respondents are therefore entitled to Payment of Gratuity only in terms of Payment of Gratuity Act and the Gratuity Rules framed by the respondent company When it is necessary for the <ORG> or authorities to fix a line or a date and there is no mathematical or logical way of fixing it precisely the decision of the <ORG> or authority must be accepted unless it is shown to be capricious or whimsical or wide off the reasonable mark The effective date fixed by the respondent being based upon the date of amendment of Payment of Gratuity Act I find no merit in the contention that the date of th September for the purpose of revising the ceiling of gratuity was fixed arbitrarily For the reasons given above I do not find any merit in the petition and the same is hereby dismissed
