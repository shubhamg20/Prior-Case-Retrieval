The petitioners claim that no sales tax was payable on the sales of wheat bran as according to the petitioners it was exempted under item No of the Notification No Bikrikar San dated th December annexure to No of as a cattle feed whereas in short the submission advanced on behalf of the <ORG> is that the effect of exemption notification dated th December is taken away because a retroactive notification with effect from th December was issued on th March Notification No which made bran exigible to tax The petitioners claim in No of by a petition dated th March that no sales tax was leviable on the sale of wheat bran which according to the petitioners was a cattle feed was rejected by the Deputy Commissioner of Commercial Taxes <NAME> Circle <NAME> respondent No by his order dated th May annexure to No of wrongly mentioned as order dated th March in paragraph of the writ petition and also in the prayer portion Similar orders as in annexures and A were passed by the Assistant Commissioner of Commercial Taxes Singhbhum Circle Jamshedpur respondent No in No of and by the Deputy Commissioner of Commercial Taxes Bokaro Circle Bokaro Steel City respondent No in No of as in annexure Before I deal with the question involved in these writ cases it is most pertinent to quote the three notifications referred to in the aforesaid paragraphs In exercise of the powers conferred by Clause a of Sub section of Section of the Bihar Sales Tax Fifth Ordinance Bihar Ordinance No of the Governor of Bihar in supersession of all previous notifications in this regard is pleased to exempt the sale of goods specified in the second column of the Schedule annexed hereto from the levy of sales tax subject to the conditions and restrictions if any set out in the corresponding entry in the third column thereof This notification shall come into force with effect from th December Notification dated th March on which the submission on behalf of the respondent <ORG> is based as follows Before I quote these notifications it is pertinent to mention that in the Bihar Gazette Extraordinary dated th March there were two notifications dated th March and they are as follows i No In exercise of the powers conferred by the proviso to Sub section of Section of the Bihar Sales Tax Fifth Ordinance Bihar Ordinance No of the Governor of Bihar is pleased to make the following amendments in the Schedule appended to the Government of Bihar Finance Commercial Taxes Department Notification No Bikrikar San dated the th December as amended from time to time namely Amendments In the said Schedule the words excluding atta maida sujji and paddy appearing within bracket in column against serial No shall be substituted by the words excluding atta maida sujji bran and paddy This notification has been marked annexure in the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the respondents in No of In exercise of the powers conferred by Clause a of Sub section of Section of the Bihar Sales Tax Fifth Ordinance Bihar Ordinance No of the Governor of Bihar is pleased to make the following amendments in the Schedules appended to the Government of Bihar <ORG> Notification No Bikrikar San dated the th December as amended from time to time namely Amendments This notification has been marked annexure A in the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the respondents in No of In exercise of the powers conferred by Sub section of Section of Part I of the Bihar Finance Act Bihar Act No of the Governor of Bihar is pleased to make the following amendments in the Schedule appended to the Government of Bihar Finance Commercial Taxes Department Notification No Bikrikar San dated the th December as amended from time to time namely Amendments This notification shall come into force with effect from st July Thus a look at the Notification No dated th December shows that amongst others cattle feed and poultry feed were exempted from levy of sales tax without any condition or restriction being imposed as per column of the Schedule to the notification and the said notification came into force with effect from th December The stand taken on behalf of the respondents was that the extent and scope of the words cattle feed was fully explained by Notification No dated th March and no item other than the four items mentioned therein classified for the exemption under entry No of Notification No dated th December as amended by Notification No dated th March Further stand taken on behalf of the respondents was that <ORG> was included in the Notification No for fixing the rate of tax per cent and hence it was submitted that as the rate of tax was fixed by the Notification No issued on the same date i th March <ORG> chokar was exigible to tax under the specific entry made in this regard in that notification On behalf of respondents it was further submitted that if the intention of the legislature was to exempt it <ORG> from taxation it would have been included to the category of cattle feed in the amended entry of Notification No of the same date i th March Though from the period th December the petitioner in No of effected sale of wheat bran obtained by it in the manufacturing process the petitioner paid sales tax including additional taxes thereon under a mistaken impression that it was liable to tax however on realising the mistake the petitioner of No of filed a petition annexure of Writ Case No of before respondent No the Deputy Commissioner of Commercial Taxes Barh Circle Barh claiming refund of the same which was refused by the impugned annexures annexures and of No of The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the explanation put by <ORG> by Notification No dated th March only explained the words cattle feed and poultry feed and it neither restricted nor extended the meaning of the words cattle feed and poultry feed What is apparent is that by the subsequent Notification No dated th March only an explanation in serial No of the original notification dated th December was inserted and there was no amendment in column of the original notification dated th December which had exempted cattle feed and poultry feed from the purview of sales tax Thus the significant question to be decided is whether chokar wheat bran was a cattle feed I will take up this question first as this is the main question Learned counsel for the petitioners has drawn my attention to the materials on the record including unambiguous admissions by the authorities of the <ORG> to the effect that chokar was essentially a cattle feed and has referred to various annexures appended to the supplementary affidavit filed on behalf of the petitioners of No of Learned counsel for the petitioners has drawn my attention to the averment made by the petitioners to the effect that chokar bran was essentially a cattle feed As a fact this averment has not been traversed repudiated by the respondents in their counter affidavit and thus chokar bran being essentially a cattle feed stands admitted by the respondents In order to strengthen the submission further the learned counsel for the petitioners has drawn my attention to a letter dated th October annexure to the supplementary affidavit filed on behalf of the petitioners in No of Sir I am directed to refer to your letter No dated th October on the subject and to say that wheat bran is essentially a cattle feed My attention was also drawn to another letter of <ORG> dated th October annexure to the supplementary affidavit filed by the petitioners My attention was further drawn to another letter annexure of the supplementary affidavit filed by the petitioners from the Director <ORG> dated th February addressed to the Executive Director of <ORG> The learned counsel for the petitioners while drawing my attention to this letter submitted that the <ORG> New Delhi was an incorporate body of <ORG> and was highly technical body from whom a clarification about wheat bran and their use in India was called for and the reply from them annexure was as follows Wheat Associates Representing Wheat Grower Organizations of the United States Again my attention was drawn to a certificate dated st March annexure to the supplementary affidavit filed by the petitioners granted by the Director in charge <ORG> New Delhi <NAME> The learned counsel for the petitioners also referred to a letter dated rd February written by <NAME> Private Secretary to the Minister of Revenue and Land Reforms and Relief Rehabilitation Department <ORG> This letter is dated rd February and has been marked as annexure to the supplementary affidavit filed by the petitioners The learned counsel for the petitioners also drew my attention to an affidavit sworn by the proprietor of the firm <ORG> at North Market Road Ranchi which deals mainly in cattle feed It is again pertinent to quote this affidavit annexure to the supplementary affidavit filed by the petitioners In <ORG> Ranchi That I on behalf of my firm use to purchase wheat bran chokar from various flour mills and sell the same to the customers who purchase it for the purpose of feeding their cattle The learned counsel for the petitioners also referred to two other affidavits i annexures and of the supplementary affidavit filed by the petitioners which are to the same effect as that of annexure That I on behalf of my firm use to purchase wheat bran chokar from various flour mills and sell the same to the customers who purchase it for the purpose of feeding their cattle That I on behalf of my firm use to purchase wheat bran chokar from various flour mills and sell the same to the customers who purchase it for the purpose of feeding their cattle In modern times cattle feed and poultry feed include a large variety of concentrates in addition to roughages that have a high value because they are rich in easily digested nutrients and feed supplement Amongst the feeds which are considered essential for the proper nutrition of animals and birds which are to be kept in a state of efficient production are included vitamins and more particularly vitamins A and which have been found to have a profound effect upon live stock farming by increasing the efficiency of animal production and preventing serious nutritional diseases Vitamin A which is required for growth reproduction production and even for maintenance and vitamin which is needed to enable the animal to assimilate and use other important elements of its feed are most apt to be lacking in natural live stock feeds and that they are included as additives in mixed feeds so as to make good the deficiency Whichever way one looks at the matter therefore whether one looks at it from the angle of the etymological meaning of the word in the context in which it is used here along with fodder and concentrates or whether one looks at it from the angle of a person conversant with the industry or trade of live stock farming or poultry raising the words cattle feed and poultry feed cannot any longer be considered as meaning only that conventional food which is necessary for the bare maintenance of cattle or birds as the case may be Such feed must consist of both the elements namely ration for maintenance and ration for production purpose As to what a wheat bran is has been explained in a letter dated th February annexure of the supplementary affidavit filed by the petitioners from the Director <ORG> representing <ORG> at New Delhi which may be referred to in paragraph of the judgment It further held that commodities had to be classified in accordance with their normal use and the words in a notification have to be interpreted as understood in common parlance The respondents have not placed any material in rebuttal of the materials filed by the petitioners i annexures to of the supplementary affidavit in No of These unimpeachable documents placed on the record by the petitioners are sufficient to hold that wheat bran is used primarily for feeding the cattle and in common parlance it would be classified as a cattle fodder and hence it is not possible to take a view that it would go outside the purview of cattle fodder only on account of some special use to which it may be put to by some consumers and for the reasons as given in those decisions also I hold that wheat bran chokar is a cattle feed Then remains the only other question to be consideredi i whether the petitioners are liable to pay sales tax on the sale of wheat bran As already stated above in the earlier part of the judgment the stand of the respondents was that the effect of the exemption Notification No dated th December is taken away because a retroactive notification with effect from th December was issued on th March Notification No which made bran exigible to tax In that view of the matter the submission advanced by the learned counsel for the respondents was that because of the retroactive notification dated th March No In my opinion there is no force in this submission This Notification No of th June came into force with effect from st July and as this was not brought on the record by either of the parties a copy of the notification was produced in the court at the time of argument and by this notification in item No of the exemption Notification No of th December the words cattle feed and poultry feed were withdrawn and only four specific items were mentioned The position would still be clear that cattle feed and poultry feed were exempted from levy of additional tax by Notification No dated th October and by this notification items to were exempted from levy of additional tax and item No was cattle feed and poultry feed reference of this notification be made at page and for item No at page of the Bihar Sales Tax Law by <NAME> Edition It is well settled that the taxing notification prescribing a rate of tax by itself will not have the overriding effect on the exemption notification There is no substance in this submission of the learned counsel for the respondents Section A by itself cannot override the power under Section On the other hand if certain goods have been classified for purposes of Section A and the point of tax has also been declared by <ORG> if such goods had been exempted from sale the department cannot contend that the exemption should not be construed in favour of the assessee Under similar situation as in the present case it was held that even though ice cream and lassi have been made taxable under Section A on account of the notifications issued under Section the turnover of these items could not be included in the net taxable turnover Thus the view taken by the revising authority that the sale of ice cream was not taxable in view of the exemption granted under the notification issued under Section in respect of milk products appears to be correct It was further held that transactions or sales which enjoy exemptions have to be included in the gross turnover but they are exempted when the net turnover is calculated FD CT dated th May issued under Section of the Act Rajasthan Sales Tax Act prescribing the rate of tax on gowar will not have overriding effect on entry of the Schedule appended to the Act which deals with exemption It further held that the notification will not nullify entry of the Schedule so far as the exclusion of gowar from cattle feed is concerned This was a Bench decision of <ORG> and it dealt with a case under the Bihar Sales Tax Act itself and it held that where under Section a particular commodity is exempted from liability of the payment of sales tax any notification relating to the rate of tax payable on any commodity must be subjected to the governing provision of Section It further held that Section postulates before the rate is made applicable i liable to sales tax It was further held that if however under Section there is also an exemption the question of applying any rate of tax obviously does not arise and where in the notification issued under this section any commodity is included which runs counter to express exemption under Section Section shall prevail over the incidental inclusion of such a commodity under Section which must be taken to be without the necessary sanction In the former case but for the provisions as regards the exemptions or refund or rebate of tax the sales or purchases would have to be included in the gross turnover of the dealer because they are prima facie liable to tax and the only thing which the dealer is entitled to in respect thereof is the deduction from the gross turnover in order to arrive at the net turnover on which the tax can be imposed In the latter case the sales or purchases are exempted from taxation altogether The legislature cannot enact a law imposing or authorising the imposition of a tax thereupon and they are not liable to any such imposition of tax If they are thus not liable to tax no tax can be levied or imposed on them and they do not come within the purview of the Act at all The very fact of their nonliability to tax is sufficient to exclude them from the calculation of the gross turnover as well as the net turnover on which sales tax can be levied or imposed Thus on a review of the aforesaid decisions I hold that the taxing notification fixing a particular rale of tax on a particular item has no overriding effect on the exemption notification which expressly exempted the particular item from levy of tax I further hold that Notification No issued on th March making bran exigible to tax retrospectively with effect from th December on which much reliance has been placed on behalf of the respondents does not nullify entry No of the exemption notification No dated th December so far as exclusion of cattle feed and poultry feed from sales tax is concerned for the simple reason that fields of operation of the two notifications referred to above under the different sections of the Act are altogether different has already been referred to above and in that Bench decision of <ORG> it was also held that if once an exemption is granted under Section of the Act in respect of any class of goods or class of persons then unless such exemption is withdrawn it shall remain in force I fully agree with the aforesaid view taken by <ORG> and I hold that if once the exemption is granted in respect of any class of goods then unless such exemption is withdrawn it shall remain in force Having held as such I hold that there is no force in the submission advanced by the learned counsel for the respondents that because of the retroactive notification dated th March No It is well settled that there can be no tax by implication and thus the submission advanced on behalf of the respondents that the retroactive notification No dated th March inferentially and by implication taxed bran by superseding the exemption notification also fails I further hold that as exemption from tax on cattle feed and poultry feed item No of the exemption Notification No of th December was withdrawn only on th June by Notification No which came into force with effect from the st July the exemption notification with regard to cattle feed and poultry feed No Then remains other important limb of the submission advanced by the learned counsel for the respondents to be considered i the stand taken by the learned counsel for the respondents was that the Notification No issued oh th March restricted the meaning of cattle feed and poultry feed by adding an explanation to the effect that Spashtikaran Pashuchara tatha kukutchara se abhipret hai Hence it was exhaustive and therefore it excluded any other item except the four mentioned in the explanation Thus though it would bear repetition on th March simultaneously two notifications were published and both were made retrospective from th December one was No by which rate of tax on bran was fixed reference of which has already been made in earlier paragraph and the other being No published in both languages i Hindi and English The learned counsel for the respondents submitted that the explanation to Notification No dated th March published in Hindi was exhaustive and it explains as to what cattle feed and poultry feed were and hence it excluded bran as bran was not included in the four items of the explanation in short the submission was that the explanation limited the categories enumerated therein and as bran was not mentioned therein it cannot be taken to be still under exemption On the other hand the submission advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioners was that the explanation does not restrict the meaning of the expression sought to be explained The learned counsel for the petitioners further submitted that there may be some cases in which an explanation can widen the meaning of the expression but in no case it can restrict in the eye of law In order to appreciate the aforesaid submissions advanced on behalf of the parties it would be most pertinent to mention just here that the Notification No published on th June the expressions cattle feed and poultry feed of item No in the exemption Notification No dated th December were dropped and only those four items as mentioned in the explanation to the expression pashuchara tatha kukutchara in the Notification No dated th March were retained Can it then be said as submitted by the learned counsel for the respondents At the outset the answer to the submission advanced on behalf of the respondents is in the negative It is true that in some cases an explanation can widen the scope of the expression sought to be explained but in such cases effect must be given to the legislative intent and the courts have to find out the true intention of the legislature It is also well settled that even if the explanation is not very happily worded but if the intention of the legislature is clear and unambiguous in that case effect must be given to the legislative intent Reference be made to the case of <NAME> Sales Tax Officer Section III Kanpur reported in AIR SC Reference of this notification has already been made in paragraph above Thus the submission advanced by the learned counsel for the respondents in my opinion is clearly untenable as it proceeds on a misconception of the scope of an explanation and hence it is without any substance and fails The same case is also reported in AIR SC and by <ORG> it has further been held in that case as follows It is no doubt true that in construing fiscal statutes and in determining the liability of a subject to tax one must have regard to the strict letter of the law and not merely to the spirit of the statute or the substance of the law If the <ORG> satisfies the court that the case falls strictly within the provisions of the law the subject can be taxed If on the other hand the case is not covered within the four corners of the provisions of the taxing statute no tax can be imposed by inference or by analogy or by trying to probe into the intentions of the legislature and by considering what was the substance of the matter We must of necessity therefore have regard to the actual provisions of the Act and the rules made thereunder before we can come to the conclusion that the appellant was liable to assessment as contended by the sales tax authorities It is also well settled that if in construing taxing statutes if two interpretations are possible effect must be given to one that favours the citizen and not to one that imposes a burden on him Then remains the only other part of the submission advanced by the learned counsel for the respondents to be considered It is well settled that if the inconsistency contradiction between the notification issued in English and the notification issued in Hindi does not affect the substance of the matter it is the notification published in English language which must prevail in view of the provisions of the Constitution of India just referred to above over the notification published in Hindi Even if there was divergence between the two versions i Hindi version of the notification and the English version of the notification by virtue of Article of the Constitution of India referred to above it is the English version that will prevail There is no competition between the two It is also pertinent to quote Clause of Article of the Constitution of India which is as follows Notwithstanding anything in Sub clause of Clause where the Legislature of a State has prescribed any language other than the English language for use in Bills introduced in or Acts passed by the <ORG> or in Ordinances promulgated by the Governor of the State or in any order rule regulation or bye law referred to in paragraph iii of that sub clause a translation of the same in the English language published under the authority of the Governor of the State in the Official Gazette of that State shall be deemed to be the authoritative text thereof in the English language under this article On the other hand learned counsel for the respondents in view of the Bihar Official Language Act read with Article of the Constitution submitted that the original notification being in Hindi the proper course was to look at the publication in Hindi principally for the purpose of properly interpreting the provision of the enactment and not the English version of the notification which merely gives the status of an authoritative text The order of detention was in Hindi the official language of the <ORG> but there was also an English version of the order of detention At the time of arrest the Hindi as well as English versions of the order of detention were served on detenu together with the grounds of detention which were also in Hindi and English versions The English version of the grounds of detention recited that the District Magistrate was satisfied that if the detenu was allowed to remain at large he would indulge in activities prejudicial to the maintenance of public order or security of the <ORG> The satisfaction which was recited in the order of detention and on which the order of detention was manifestly and avowedly based was that it was necessary to detain the petitioner with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order There was no reference to the security of the <ORG> in the recital of the satisfaction contained in the order of detention either in Hindi version or in English version In such circumstances it was held that the addition of the words security of the <ORG> in the recital of the satisfaction of the District Magistrate in the English version was the result of inadvertence and the order of detention could not be invalidated on the basis of such an obvious error ignoring the order of detention in both its Hindi and English versions Hindi version of grounds of detention and the totality of the context so far as English version was concerned On the facts of that case it was further held that Hindi being the official language of the <ORG> it was Hindi version of the grounds of detention which was to be regarded as authentic and the validity of detention on the facts of that case was to be judged with reference to the Hindi version of the grounds of detention Article iii and Clause of Article of the Constitution were not under consideration in the case of <NAME> AIR SC and thus reliance placed by the learned counsel for the respondents on this case in support of his submission was under a misconception There was apparent inconsistency between the amending statute admittedly in Hindi and the English version of that amendment i Section A a of the Bihar State Universities Act as amended in and hence the ratio decided in this case was on the particular facts and circumstances of that case This case too does not support the submission advanced by the learned counsel for the respondents Thus in view of the weighty pronouncement as referred to above I hold that in view of the provisions as contained in Article iii of the Constitution of India the notification dated th March appearing in English must prevail over the notification of the same date appearing in Hindi I further hold that though it is true that Hindi has been adopted as the official language of the State of Bihar under the Bihar Official Language Act there was no conflict inconsistency contradiction in the Hindi and English versions of the notification dated th March and hence it was the English version of the notification dated th March which must prevail over the Hindi notification of the same date I further hold that even if there was some inconsistency conflict which there is none in the two notifications they did not affect the substance of the matter in the present case and in that view of the matter also it was the notification in English which must prevail under Article iii of the Constitution of India Before concluding this point to me it appears that it is of importance that in the matter of issuing and publishing notifications which are now issued in Hindi and it may be noted that it is only that Hindi version of the <ORG> that is available to the general public great care should be taken and the people concerned with making these notifications should have taken greater care in having them published in Hindi Thus all the submissions advanced by the learned counsel for the respondents fail as being without any substance
