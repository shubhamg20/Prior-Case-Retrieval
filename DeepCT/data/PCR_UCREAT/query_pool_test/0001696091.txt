Challenge in these appeals is to the judgment of <ORG> of <ORG> accepting the appeal filed by the respondents who were found guilty of offences punishable under Section read with Section of the Indian Penal Code in short the IPC <ORG> held that if on taking overall view of the case right of self defence is made out or looks probable from the evidence on record that right should not be construed narrowly because the right of self defence is a very valuable right and it has a social purpose The witnesses succeeded in apprehending <NAME> along with the knife with which he had assaulted the deceased and <NAME> He took up investigation and recorded the statement of first information at the police station The dead body was then sent for postmortem examination with constable <NAME> and <NAME> Dr <NAME> conducted autopsy on the dead body of <NAME> on at noon and following ante mortem injuries were found Since the accused persons pleaded innocence trial was held The accused persons took the stand that on the date of occurrence accused <NAME> went to throw cow dung in the field in the morning and he was assaulted by <NAME> with lathi He assaulted the deceased <ORG> it is submitted accepted the plea of right of private defence but without any material to substantiate the plea <ORG> came to an abrupt conclusion that the right has been exercised and the accused persons were acting in self defence <ORG> on analyzing the evidence came to a conclusion that the accused persons were exercising the right of private defence Section IPC provides that nothing is an offence which is done in the exercise of the right of private defence The Section does not define the expression right of private defence It merely indicates that nothing is an offence which is done in the exercise of such right Whether in a particular set of circumstances a person legitimately acted in the exercise of the right of private defence is a question of fact to be determined on the facts and circumstances of each case No test in the abstract for determining such a question can be laid down In determining this question of fact the <ORG> must consider all the surrounding circumstances It is not necessary for the accused to plead in so many words that he acted in self defence In a given case the <ORG> can consider it even if the accused has not taken it if the same is available to be considered from the material on record Under Section of the Indian Evidence Act in short the Evidence Act the burden of proof is on the accused who sets up the plea of self defence and in the absence of proof it is not possible for the <ORG> to presume the truth of the plea of self defence The <ORG> shall presume the absence of such circumstances It is for the accused to place necessary material on record either by himself adducing positive evidence or by eliciting necessary facts from the witnesses examined for the prosecution An accused taking the plea of the right of private defence is not necessarily required to call evidence he can establish his plea by reference to circumstances transpiring from the prosecution evidence itself The question in such a case would be a question of assessing the true effect of the prosecution evidence and not a question of the accused discharging any burden Where the right of private defence is pleaded the defence must be a reasonable and probable version satisfying the <ORG> that the harm caused by the accused was necessary for either warding off the attack or for forestalling the further reasonable apprehension from the side of the accused The burden of establishing the plea of self defence is on the accused and the burden stands discharged by showing preponderance of probabilities in favour of that plea on the basis of the material on record Sections to define the extent of the right of private defence of body If a person has a right of private defence of body under Section that right extends under Section to causing death if there is reasonable apprehension that death or grievous hurt would be the consequence of the assault AIR SC runs as follows It is true that the burden on an accused person to establish the plea of self defence is not as onerous as the one which lies on the prosecution and that while the prosecution is required to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt the accused need not establish the plea to the hilt and may discharge his onus by establishing a mere preponderance of probabilities either by laying basis for that plea in the cross examination of the prosecution witnesses or by adducing defence evidence The accused need not prove the existence of the right of private defence beyond reasonable doubt A plea of right of private defence cannot be based on surmises and speculation While considering whether the right of private defence is available to an accused it is not relevant whether he may have a chance to inflict severe and mortal injury on the aggressor In order to find whether the right of private defence is available to an accused the entire incident must be examined with care and viewed in its proper setting Section deals with the subject matter of right of private defence The plea of right comprises the body or property i of the person exercising the right or ii of any other person and the right may be exercised in the case of any offence against the body and in the case of offences of theft robbery mischief or criminal trespass and attempts at such offences in relation to property Section lays down the limits of the right of private defence Sections and give a right of private defence against certain offences and acts The right given under Sections to and to is controlled by Section To claim a right of private defence extending to voluntary causing of death the accused must show that there were circumstances giving rise to reasonable grounds for apprehending that either death or grievous hurt would be caused to him The burden is on the accused to show that he had a right of private defence which extended to causing of death Sections and IPC define the limit and extent of right of private defence Sections and IPC deal with commencement and continuance of the right of private defence of body and property respectively The right commences as soon as a reasonable apprehension of danger to the body arises from an attempt or threat to commit the offence although the offence may not have been committed but not until there is that reasonable apprehension In <NAME> State of Punjab AIR SC it was observed that as soon as the cause for reasonable apprehension disappears and the threat has either been destroyed or has been put to route there can be no occasion to exercise the right of private defence In order to find whether right of private defence is available or not the injuries received by the accused the imminence of threat to his safety the injuries caused by the accused and the circumstances whether the accused had time to have recourse to public authorities are all relevant factors to be considered In moments of excitement and disturbed mental equilibrium it is often difficult to expect the parties to preserve composure and use exactly only so much force in retaliation commensurate with the danger apprehended to him where assault is imminent by use of force it would be lawful to repel the force in self defence and the right of private defence commences as soon as the threat becomes so imminent Such situations have to be pragmatically viewed and not with high powered spectacles or microscopes to detect slight or even marginal overstepping Due weightage has to be given to and hyper technical approach has to be avoided in considering what happens on the spur of the moment on the spot and keeping in view normal human reaction and conduct where self preservation is the paramount consideration The <ORG> dealing with the plea has to weigh the material to conclude whether the plea is acceptable The right of self defence is a very valuable right serving a social purpose and should not be construed narrowly Situations have to be judged from the subjective point of view of the accused concerned in the surrounding excitement and confusion of the moment confronted with a situation of peril and not by any microscopic and pedantic scrutiny In adjudging the question as to whether more force than was necessary was used in the prevailing circumstances on the spot it would be inappropriate as held by this <ORG> to adopt tests by detached objectivity which would be so natural in a <ORG> room or that which would seem absolutely necessary to a perfectly cool bystander The person facing a reasonable apprehension of threat to himself cannot be expected to modulate his defence step by step with any arithmetical exactitude of only that much which is required in the thinking of a man in ordinary times or under normal circumstances In these cases he is not obliged to retreat and may not merely resist the attack where he stands but may indeed pursue his adversary until the danger is ended and if in a conflict between them he happens to kill his attacker such killing is justifiable The right of private defence is essentially a defensive right circumscribed by the governing statute i the IPC available only when the circumstances clearly justify it It is a right of defence not of retribution expected to repel unlawful aggression and not as retaliatory measure A right to defend does not include a right to launch an offensive particularly when the need to defend no longer survived If that be so there was no question of exercise of right of private defence From the evidence it is clear that after the accused persons assaulted the deceased and the injured witnesses they were beaten by the villagers In the FIR also there is mention about the beating given by villagers Conviction can be based on the testimony of single witness if he is wholly reliable If the evidence is unblemished and beyond all possible criticism and the <ORG> is satisfied that the witness was speaking the truth then on his evidence alone conviction can be maintained Undisputedly there were injuries found on the body of the accused persons on medical evidence That per se cannot be a ground to totally discard the prosecution version This is a factor which has to be weighed along with other materials to see whether the prosecution version is reliable cogent and trustworthy When the case of the prosecution is supported by an eyewitness who is found to be truthful as well mere non explanation of the injuries on the accused persons cannot be a foundation for discarding the prosecution version Other plea emphasized related to alleged exercise of right of private defence Merely because there was a quarrel and two accused persons sustained injuries that does not confer a right of private defence extending to the extent of causing death as in this case Though such right cannot be weighed in golden scales it has to be established that the accused persons were under such grave apprehension about the safety of their life and property that retaliation to the extent done was absolutely necessary No evidence much less cogent and credible was adduced in this regard The right of private defence as claimed by the accused persons have been rightly discarded SCC it was held as follows Non explanation of injuries by the prosecution will not affect prosecution case where injuries sustained by the accused are minor and superficial or where the evidence is so clear and cogent so independent and disinterested so probable consistent and creditworthy that it outweighs the effect of the omission on the part of prosecution to explain the injuries It is for the defence to put questions to the prosecution witnesses regarding the injuries of the accused persons When that is not done there is no occasion for the prosecution witnesses to explain any injury on the person of an accused State of Bihar AIR SC it was observed that the obligation of the prosecution to explain the injuries sustained by the accused in the same occurrence may not arise in each and every case In other words it is not an invariable rule that the prosecution has to explain the injuries sustained by the accused in the same occurrence If the witnesses examined on behalf of the prosecution are believed by the <ORG> in proof of guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt question of obligation of prosecution to explain injuries sustained by the accused will not arise When the prosecution comes with a definite case that the offence has been committed by the accused and proves its case beyond any reasonable doubt it becomes hardly necessary for the prosecution to again explain how and under what circumstances injuries have been inflicted on the person of the accused In the case at hand trifle and superficial injuries on accused are of little assistance to them to throw doubt on veracity of prosecution case The respondents are therefore convicted of offence punishable under Section Part I Custodial sentence of years would meet the ends of justice The appeals are allowed to the aforesaid extent The respondents who are on bail shall surrender to custody forthwith to serve the remainder of sentence
