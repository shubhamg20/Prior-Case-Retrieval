The assessments were made in the status of resident and ordinarily resident In the course of the assessment proceedings for the assessment year the Income tax Officer became aware that these assessees were non residents and that they had income outside the taxable territories which if taken into account under the relevant provisions of the Indian Income tax Act would attract tax at a rate higher than that at which they had been assessed Accordingly he reopened the assessments of these two assessees for the said years and issued notices to them under section of the Act In the returns filed by the assessees in response to these notices they declared their status as non residents and furnished their incomes as they appeared in the original returns made by them The Income tax Officer however assessed them to tax at the rates applicable to non residents but on the income that arose or accrued in the taxable territories Against these assessments appeals were taken to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner it being contended that section of the Act did not authorise the assessment at the maximum rate that the notices were invalid inasmuch as they did not contain the necessary particulars required to be stated therein and further that the provision of the Indian Income tax Act imposing the liability to tax on a non resident at the maximum rate was unconstitutional as offending article of the Constitution of India Under section of the Act the assessees moved the <ORG> to refer certain questions of law for the consideration of this court and the questions of law so referred ar Whether the provision of the Income tax Act for the levy of maximum rate is not a denial of equality before the law within the meaning of article of the Constitution of India and void under article and the present assessment as a non resident at the maximum rate is not therefore void Whether the aforesaid reassessments under section for all the assessment years to in the case of <NAME> and assessment years to in the case <NAME> are valid We shall deal with the second question first One of the grounds urged on behalf of the assessees is that the notice did not comply with the requirements of the section and furnished no information to the assessee of the particular reasons which led to the reopening of the assessments What is contended in this regard is that in the copy of the notice issued by the Income tax Officer the Income tax Officer stated that he had reason to believe that the assessees income assessable to income tax for the relevant assessment year had a escaped assessment been under assessed been assessed at too low a rate been subject to excessive relief and been the subject of computation of the excessive loss or depreciation allowance He continued in the notice I therefore propose to reassess the said income less depreciation that has a escaped assessment He also indicated that the notice was issued after obtaining the necessary satisfaction of the Commissioner of Income tax Madras If the assessee fails to furnish his total world income to enable the tax to be levied on the basis of a rate dependent upon such total world income the Income tax Officer is authorised to levy the tax at the maximum rate as provided by section of the Indian Income tax Act Since the assessees had failed to disclose their status as non residents but had in their original returns indicated that they were residents of Panruti and failed also to furnish particulars of their incomes derived outside the taxable territories the tax had been levied at a rate relevant to the income disclosed in those returns income that accrued or arose within the taxable territories only Mr <NAME> for the assessee contends that the Income tax Officer was bound to disclose in the notice issued by him the particular reason for the reopening of the assessments and whether the case requiring action fell with one or the other of the heads referred to It is contended that section requires that that should be done and if that is not done the notice is not a proper notice and the proceedings stand wholly invalidated The relevant requirements in so far as they are material to the present case are that the Income tax Officer should have reason to believe that by reason of the failure on the part of the assessee to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for his assessment for that year the income profits or gains chargeable to income tax had escaped assessment for that year or been under assessed or been assessed at too low a rate If he has such reason he is required to serve on the assessee a notice containing all or any of the requirements which may be included in a notice under sub section of section It is clear therefore that when the Income tax Officer honestly believes that the income profits or gains have been assessed at too low a rate by reason of the failure of the assessee to disclose all material facts necessary for his assessment the only notice that he is called upon to issue to the assessee is a notice of the description referred to in section sub section It does not even appear from the section that the Income tax Officer should expressly state it to be a notice under section of the Act If it is a case where the assessee had already been assessed for a particular year a subsequent notice issued calling upon him to comply with the requirements of section sub section would clearly indicate to the assessee that it was a case of reopening of the assessment Even otherwise if the assessee had not submitted his return and the assessment year had elapsed even a notice issued for the first time by the Income tax Officer under section is one which comes within the scope of section for it would be a case where there had been a failure of the assessee to make a return of his income and the income profits or gains chargeable to income tax had escaped assessment for that year It may also be specifically noticed that the requirements of a notice purporting to be the precursor of the reopening of the assessment is not in any way different from the requirements of a notice required to be issued under section of the Act In this provision the notices which the Income tax Officer is called upon to issue is to demand a return in the prescribed form and verified in the prescribed manner setting forth along with such other particulars as may be provided in the notice his total income and total world income during the previous year It follows therefore that a notice leading to the reopening of the assessment under section is not any special kind of notice which requires any information to be furnished to the assessee as to the reasons for reopening We are not satisfied also that beyond the fact that the Income tax Officer purports to exercise his jurisdiction under section of the Act and to reopen the assessment it is necessary for the Income tax Officer to inform the assessee of the particular reasons leading to the reopening of the assessment It would suffice in our opinion if the notice merely stated that the Income tax Officer believed that the case of the assessee required reopening of the assessment under section of the Act and to indicate that he had complied with the requirements of the provision by obtaining the prior approval of the Commissioner of Income tax and in terms of the section called upon the assessee to submit a return containing such particulars as section sub section requires The conditions for reopening of the assessment are not the same as the contents of the notice to be issued to the assessee The conditions requisite are merely that the Income tax Officer should have reason to believe that one or the other of the grounds necessitating the revision of the assessment existed in the case Which precise grounds operated on his mind and what reasons impelled him to come to that conclusion are not required to be intimated to the assessee It may be that when the Income tax Officer commences the proceedings under section he might have had reason to believe that a particular item of income had escaped to be included in the assessable income of the assessee It may transpire in the course of the proceedings that excessive relief had been given to the assessee and it would be open to the Income tax Officer to deal with that aspect of the matter also We are unable to gather anything from this decision which supports the contention at present raised with regard to the requirements of the notice That was a case where the Income tax Officer issued a notice under section of the Act as it stood then for the purpose of raising the rate of tax on the grounds that the rate originally fixed was too low The argument was that the Income tax Officer was bound to begin proceedings again as regards assessment and proceed as if there was an enquiry in respect not only of the portion which had escaped assessment but of all other items also The learned judges observe The scheme of section of the Act is that if the conditions of the main section are satisfied a notice has to be issued to the assessee containing all or any of the requirements which may be included in a notice under sub section of section But before issuing the notice the proviso requires that the officer should record his reasons for initiating action under section and obtain the sanction of the Commissioner who must be satisfied that the action under section was justified There is no requirement in any of the provisions of the Act or any section laying down as a condition for initiation of the proceedings that the reasons which induced the Commissioner to accord sanction to proceed under section must also be communicated to the assessee It is not intended by the proviso that the reasons should be communicated to the assessee The learned judges also observed that it was unnecessary for the notice to state whether the Income tax Officer was limiting the assessment for the period of eight years or four years that is to say whether it was a case which the Income tax Officer thought came within the scope of a or The learned judges observed that all that the section itself says is that the Income tax Officer may serve on the assessee The main notice to be issued is therefore a notice under section of the Act and section only authorises the issue of such a notice in spite of there having been a previous assessment or inspite of the time for the issue of a notice in the normal way having expired It is true that when answering a notice issued under the section the assessee may take a plea of limitation and for purposes of such a plea it may be necessary for him to know whether his case is being treated as one under clause a or as one under clause It appears to me however that whether the case is treated as coming under one clause or the other will transpire in the course of the assessment proceedings and it is neither required of the Income tax Officer not is it necessary that he should specify the clause in the notice itself The power to make such an assessment exhausts itself when once it is exercised So also it is claimed the power to reopen an assessment should be deemed to be exhausted when resort to that provision has been had once Section was intended to deal with cases of escapement of income tax broadly speaking It may happen that the Income tax Officer comes to know that a particular item of income had escaped assessment and take steps to bring that income to tax by way of proceedings under section If the underlying intendment of the section is to deal with cases of escaped income we fail to see why the Income tax Officer should be prevented from having resort to that provision when on a subsequent occasion he becomes aware that another item of income had also escaped assessment The section could be resorted to only within the period of limitation prescribed and it can be invoked in our opinion on any number of occasions which justifies resort to it The learned judge observed that within the time limit specified in section of the Indian Income tax Act there is no restriction as to the number of proceedings that can be taken to reopen the assessment by way of assessment or reassessment computation or re computation We agree with this view of the learned judge The question was very shortly disposed of with the observatio A simple reading of the sub section leaves no doubt that it places no limit to the number of notices that may be issued so long as they are within the time limit specified in that section There can be no restriction as to the number of proceedings that can be taken to reopen the assessment where it is found that any income of the assessee has for one reason or another escaped assessment In the assessment order for the assessment year the Income tax Officer states that when the assessee submitted a return in response to the notice under section he correctly declared his degree of residence as non resident There is no doubt therefore that the assessee was fully aware of the reasons that led to the reopening of the assessment We have next to consider whether the present case would fall within sub clause a or of section That would lead us to a consideration of the question whether the disclosure of the status of the assessee as a resident or non resident is not a material fact necessary for his assessment The law broadly stated imposes the liability to tax on the income of any assessee at a rate dependent on the total world income In the particular case of a non resident who has income accruing or arising both within and without the taxable territories the income arising without the taxable territories is brought to tax but at a rate dependent upon his total world income It is undoubtedly a material fact necessary for the assessment and it is indisputable that in the present case the assessee had failed to disclose this material fact in his return for the relevant assessment years This is clearly a case that falls within the scope of section a It is argued by Mr <NAME> in this regard that there has been no failure on the part of the assessee to disclose this material fact and that at the best it can only be regarded that in consequence of information which the Income tax Officer came to possess the assessment had been made at too low a rate It is alleged that the assessees might have thought that they fell into all the categories of resident non resident or resident but not ordinarily resident There has undoubtedly been a failure on the part of the assessee to disclose the material fact We must repel the argument that the case is one which comes under sub clause It is next contended that the provision in the Income tax Act levying tax at the maximum rate on a non resident is violative of article of the Constitution Suffice it to say courts have uniformly held that discrimination cannot be lightly inferred and that a classification of the subject matter for legislation is permissible under the Constitution so long as that classification is based upon some real an substantial distinction and has reasonable relation to the object of the legislation Having thus broadly stated the proposition it should necessary follow that the classification of persons for the purpose of levying tax on their incomes on the basis of their status as residents and non residents it undoubtedly a real one But what is contended is that for the purpose of levy of tax such classification and the imposition of a differential levy has no relation to the object of the taxing enactment It is urged also that the legislature is not competent to tax the other income that is to say income which does not arise or accrue within the taxable territories in the case of a non resident and that being so it must equally follow that there can be no lawful authority for the levy of tax on a non resident at a higher rate dependent upon the extra territorial income In so far as a non resident as a person who earns income within the taxable territories is concerned undoubtedly a sufficient territorial connection is established between the person sought to be taxed and the country seeking to tax him In so far as income derived from the taxable territory is concerned it is competent to the Indian legislature to fix the rate of tax upon such income on the basis of any reasonable classification We are only dealing with the question whether a rate of tax dependent upon the classification of the assessee as resident or non resident has a reasonable relation to the object of the legislation The assessee will pay the costs of the department Question answered against the assessee
