In this case at the instance of the assessee the following two questions have been referred to us for our opinion Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case conclusion reached by the <ORG> in holding that the assessee did not commence its business prior to June and consequently not entitled to expenditure incurred by it amounting to Rs For assessment year it submitted its return for the period November to December showing a loss of Rs The company actually started production of conductors on June and for the period from January to June the company claimed a loss of Rs According to <ORG> the assessee company commenced its business on June and therefore the expenditure incurred prior to that date from January onwards was not allowable The assessee took the matter in appeal but the Appellate Assistant Commissioner confirmed the view of the Income tax Officer and dismissed the appeal The matter was taken in further appeal before the <ORG> According to the <ORG> the point which required decision in this case was whether the assessee company could be said to have commenced its business activities from the beginning of the accounting period viz November so as to enable the assessee to claim the expenditure incurred by it from that date as business expenditure The <ORG> held that the decision of the Income tax Officer and the Appellate Assistant Commissioner was correct namely that the assessee did not commence its business prior to June and hence there was no necessity to change that conclusion Thereafter at the instance of the assessee the questions set out hereinabove have been referred to us for our opinion According to that section for the purposes of the Act previous year means in the case of a business or profession newly set up in the said financial year the period beginning with the date of the setting up of the business or profession and ending with the said financial year or if the accounts of the assessee have been made up to a date within the said financial year then at the option of the assessee ending on that date as the case may be In this connection there are several decisions specifying what can be said to be the date of setting up of the business When a business is established and is ready to commence business then it could be said of that business that business is set up but before it is ready to commence business it is not set up There may however be an interval between the setting up of the business and the commencement of the business and all expenses incurred during that interval would be permissible deductions The distinction is this that when a business is established and is ready to commence business then it can be said of that business that it is set up ITR SC <ORG> referred to the decision of Chagla in <ORG> case ITR Bom <ORG> in that case was concerned with the words in a new and separate unit set up after the commencement of the Act by way of substantial expansion of its undertaking At page of the report <NAME> delivering the judgment of <ORG> observed The words set up in the principal clause in our opinion is equivalent to the word established but operations for establishment cannot be equated with the establishment of the unit itself or its setting up The applicability of the proviso has therefore to be decided by finding out when the company commenced operations for establishment of the unit which operations must be antecedent to the actual date on which the company is held to have been set up for purposes of the principal clause This is also the meaning that <ORG> derived in the case in <ORG> ITR Bom where that court was concerned with the interpretation of the expression set up as used in section of the Income tax Act The criterion for determining the period of exemption is based on the commencement of the operations for the establishment of the unit In fact it is the operations for establishment of a unit which ultimately culminate in the setting up of the unit ITR Guj a Division Bench of this High Court has held there is a clear distinction between commencing a business and setting it up The business must be put into such a shape that it can start functioning as a business or a manufacturing organization It placed orders for machinery and equipment in January and some of the machinery was received in February It also placed orders for raw materials and stores and took on lease premises from an industrial estate The assessee claimed to deduct a sum of Rs In the case before <ORG> the business could not be said to be set up until July when the machinery had been installed and the factory was ready to commence business <ORG> held that it was only when the machinery was installed that business could be said to be put into such a shape that it could start functioning as a business or a manufacturing organisation These were merely operations for the setting up of the business and the business could be set up only as a culmination of these operations when all that was necessary for the setting up of the business was done and it was only after the machinery was installed and the factory was ready to commence business that it could be said that the new business was set up by the assessee All the activities which go to make up the business need not be started simultaneously in order that the business may commence The business would commence when the activity which is first in point of time and which must necessarily precede all other activities is started It claimed the expenditure incurred for the purpose of extracting limestone as also depreciation and development rebate for the machinery installed for that purpose for assessment years and On these facts it was held that the activities which constituted the business of the assessee were divisible into three categories the first category consisted of the activity of extraction of limestone by quarrying the leased area of land This activity was necessary for the purpose of acquiring the raw material to be utilised in the manufacture of cement The second activity comprised the activity of manufacture of cement by use of the plant and machinery set up for that purpose and the third category consisted of selling manufactured cement These three activities combined together constituted the business of the assessee The activity of quarrying the leased area of land and extracting limestone from it was as much an activity in the course of carrying on the business as the other two activities of manufacture of cement and sale of manufactured cement This activity came first in point of time and laid the foundation for the second activity and the second activity when completed laid the foundation for the third activity Hence the assessee commenced its business when it started the activity of extraction of limestone Since extraction of limestone commenced in the assessee was carrying on business during the relevant years of account The expenditure incurred by the assessee in carrying on the activity of extraction of limestone as also depreciation allowance and development rebate in respect of machinery employed in extracting limestone were deductible in computing the trading profits of the assessee for assessment years and At page of the report <ORG> delivering the judgment of the <ORG> observed It is necessary in order to determine this question to consider what constituted the business of the assessee Loosely it may be said that the business of the assessee was manufacture and sale of cement But in determining questions arising under fiscal legislation loose use of expression often tends to confound the real issue To determine what was the business of the assessee we must consider what are the activities which constituted such business without being misguided by loose expressions of vague and indefinite import It may be that the whole business was not set up when the activity of quarrying the leased area of land and extracting limestone was started But as pointed out above business is nothing more than a continuous course of activities and all the activities which go to make up the business need not be started simultaneously in order that the business may commence The business would commence when the activity which is first in point of time and which must necessarily precede the other activities is started Take for example a case where an assessee engages in the business of trader which consists of purchasing and selling goods The assessee must necessarily purchase goods in order to be able to sell them and purchase of goods must therefore necessarily precede their sale Can it be said in such a case that when the assessee purchases goods for the purpose of sale he does not commence his business Is it necessary that he must start the activity of selling goods before he can be said to have commenced his business We have to consider the question as to when an assessee can be said to have commenced business from a common sense point of view We have to ask ourselves the question as to when a businessman would regard a business as being commenced Would he not consider a business as having commenced when an assential activity of that business is started The argument of the revenue seeks to confound the commencement of a business with the estabment of the business as a whole and carrying on of all the activities of the business The test which was laid down was of the starting of an activity which is an essential activity in the course of carrying on the business or in other words is a business activity and the moment that activity started the assessee must be held to have commenced the business The main object of the company was to acquire immovable property and to give it out either on leave and licence basis or on lease as residential or in the alternative business accommodation with all appurtenant amenities including the amenities of storage watch and ward facilities canteens refreshment rooms etc Thereafter building repairs rewiring installation of lift etc were carried on by the company for the purpose of converting the residential accommodation to business and storage accommodation and to render the premises more serviceable to its prospective licensees or lessees The assessee claimed that it was in a position to offer services to licensees on and from October and therefore claimed that expenditure of Rs The Income tax Officer the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and <ORG> all held that the company could not be said to have been ready to commence business prior to May the day on which it gave on leave and licence part of the said building and certainly not by October and disallowed the deduction claimed <ORG> held on reference that the business activities of the company could be said to fall into three broad categories The first business activity was to acquire either by purchase or by any other manner immovable property so that the property could be ultimately given out either on leave and licence basis or on lease to others together with the appurtenant services The second category of the business activity was to put the building accommodation and lands and gardens in proper shape and set up the appurtenant services so that ultimately the property could be given out on leave and licence basis were acquired by purchase or otherwise lift was installed and ultimately with effect from May a portion of the accommodation was actually given out on licence basis Under these circumstances it was held that at any rate from October the assessee could be said to have commenced its business activity of the second category and therefore the assessee company had commenced business on that date and all expenses incurred by the assessee between October and March namely the amount of Rs The company can be said to have set up its business from the date when one of the categories of its business activity is started and it is not necessary that all the categories of its business activities must start either simultaneously or that the last stage must start before it can be said that the business was set up In the instant case we find from the memorandum and articles of association of the company that under the objects clause of the company the object of the company is to carry on the business of manufacture buy or otherwise acquire sell import export distribute deal in and dispose of and turn to account produce ACSR all aluminium and copper conductors aluminium and copper binding wires strips covered conductor and all types of wires cables telephonic and telegraphic cables and underground cables and all other materials used in the manufacture of the above items as dealers in or manufacturers of any other articles or things of a character similar or analogous to the foregoing or any of them or connected therewith Article of the articles of association is included in the articles dealing with capital and the marginal note is Taking over a concern The assessee company also as part of the assets of that firm acquired the know how for the manufacture of aluminium conductors and other conductors and it got the benefit of the licence which was issued by <ORG> in favour of <ORG> Mr <NAME> has contended before us that the assessee company was formed for the purpose of taking over the business of the going concern of <ORG> Ahmedabad and it actually took over some of the contracts which <ORG> had entered into with <ORG> of different States in India lakh or so and it also got the benefit of some contracts which the <ORG> had entered into even before the assessee company was incorporated The balance sheet disclosed that the company had given a counter guarantee to <ORG> for guarantee given by bank for Rs for purchase of two cars and a further counter guarantee to Central <ORG> for guarantee given to various <ORG> of Rs It is true that in the auditors report it was stated that depreciation was not claimed but as Mr <NAME> explained since there was no production depreciation could not be claimed Over and above these contracts other contracts were also secured by the company before it actually started production as shown in annexure to the statement of the case and by the time it was ready to commence the business it had already secured orders worth Rs In the instant case the company has started securing orders well in advance of the date on which it actually started production of aluminium conductors The orders acquired by the assessee company from the different <ORG> ensured ready market for the company when the company actually went into production and it purchased raw materials and stock in advance so that it could go into production on an appropriate scale and supply the goods against the orders which it had already received All the time we have to bear in mind that the test is of commonsense and what in the eye of a businessman can be said to be the commencement of the business Since selling the goods manufactured by the assessee company is an important part of the business activity it can be said that the assessee company in the instant case commenced its business and its business was set up when it started securing orders against further production In this case the assessee company has commenced its business by securing orders first and going to production later on was being attended to and when the company was ready to go into production it actually started production and supplied goods against the orders which it had already booked The <ORG> was therefore in error in not analysing the activities of the assessee company in the instant case into the essential components of that business activity and ascertaining whether one or the other of those component activities had commenced before the actual date of going into production The <ORG> was in error when it overlooked this distinction between the component business activity and the business activity as a whole and the <ORG> was in error in holding that the assessee had not commenced its business prior to June The Commissioner will pay the costs of this reference to the assessee
