In addition to these five mortgages there were also three other mortgages of which the plaintiffs were not the direct mortgagees but assignees from those who were the original mortgagees The plaintiffs brought their suit to enforce the mortgages and in addition to joining the mortgagors they also joined certain persons who were defendants Nos to who had bought from the mortgagors the equities of redemption of the properties hypothecated by virtue of the five mortgage deeds referred to above But on appeal the learned District Judge came to the conclusion that the decree so far as it related to relief against these purchasers of the equities of redemption could not be in law upheld It is also common ground that the plaintiffs had no notice of what had taken place between the mortgagors and the purchasers of the equities of redemption and were not privy to the contract The defendants had borrowed a sum of money from the plaintiff for which they had given a promissory note they subsequently transferred their property to another party who executed an agreement in their favour expressly undertaking to pay to the lender of the money under the promissory note his dues thereunder There are also other cases which have been quoted by the learned Advocate for the appellant which certainly at first sight appear to support to some extent the learned Advocate argument I A their Lordships of <ORG> held that under certain circumstances to which I shall refer presently it was possible for a person who was no party to an agreement to take advantage of the provisions of such an agreement which were in fact beneficial to herself A minor Muhammadan lady prior to and in consideration of her marriage with the son of the defend ant in the suit was promised by the defendant under an agreement executed between the defendant and the lady father to be paid by the defendant the sum of Rs It was maintained on behalf of the defence on the line of reasoning adopted in the well known English case Tweddle <NAME> Jur that as the plaintiff was in no way an actual party to the agreement made between her father and the defendant she had no locus standi and was unable to sue thereunder was one decided under the Common Law of England and was not in their Lordships opinion applicable to the facts which were disclosed in the case before their Lordships The case however appears to me to be distinguishable from the present case in view of the fact that the benefit which was to accrue to the plaintiff was one for which the consideration was the marriage to take place between herself and the defendant son Then there is another case which was cited on behalf of the plaintiffs <NAME> <NAME> Ind In that case <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> held that where the transferee of a debtor liability acknowledged in the provisions of the registered instrument which conveyed to him all the original debtor properties his obligation Lo the creditor for the debt to be paid by him and where the acknowledgment was communicated to the creditor and accepted by him the creditor could sue the transferee on the registered instrument Here again their Lordships based their decision upon the equitable principle which had operated upon the minds of their Lordships of <ORG> in the case which I have just quoted it may indeed be said that the facts disclosed that the creditor was actually privy to and concerned in the transaction which took place between the transferee and the debtor In fact in the judgment of <NAME> <NAME> it is expressly stated that there was an arrangement between the plaintiff and defendant No by which the liability of defendant No under the transfer was acknowledged and accepted and it may also be observed that although under the mistaken idea of their true legal effect certain title deeds were actually handed over at that time by the purchaser to the plaintiff does constitute some authority to support the argument which has been addressed to us by the learned Advocate who has appeared for the appellants There are however on the other hand two cases which appear to be conclusive authority upon the point which has been argued in this appeal The action is brought by a mortgagee to enforce against purchaser of the mortgaged property an undertaking that he entered into with his vendor His Lordship continues The mortgagee has no right to avail himself of that The purchaser entered into no contract with him and the purchaser is not personally bound to pay his mortgage debt There is still a later case in which the same proposition has been similarly set forth in another decision of their Lordships of <ORG> We have had the advantage however of seeing what the facts were from the record of this <ORG> the case having been tried on appeal on the th June before <NAME> and <NAME> JJ The facts were substantially identical with those which exists in the present appeal A mortgagor having executed a mortgage in favour of the plaintiff sold the property to a third party who in the recitals of this sale deed agreed to pay off the mortgage with a provision of the purchase money which was for that purpose left in his hands The mortgagee sued upon his mortgage not only the mortgagor but also the purchaser but this <ORG> refused to grant any personal decree against the purchaser holding that he the mortgagee could not avail himself of the stipulation made in the contract between the purchaser and the mortgagor Their Lordships have considered this case and they think it is clear that no personal liability was incurred by the purchasers of the equity of redemption Their Lordships therefore think that the decree of the High <ORG> was right and that the point made by the appellant fails It seems therefore that we are clearly bound by the authority of these two decisions of <ORG> which are so directly in point The appeal therefore must be dismissed with costs I should mention that there was a cross objection which however is not pressed and has not been argued and that cross objection also must be dismissed with costs It is said by the learned Advocate who has appeared for the appellants and it may be mentioned that the question is referred to in ground No of the appellants grounds of appeal to this Court that there has been some arithmetical or other mistake with regard to the amount of costs which have been awarded to the defendants Nos to We have however no materials whatever before us which would enable us to discuss or consider this point It is to be borne in mind that in the present case there was no notice to the plaintiff at the time of the contract In the judgment of <ORG> we see that the promisee that is to say the plaintiff had a proposal made to him by the promisor that is to say defendant No and he accepted it He held the benefit of a contract for consideration In the present case the plaintiff who claims to be the promisee has never had a proposal made to him by the defendants against whom he is seeking a money decree and he certainly never accepted any such proposal That is the distinction between the two classes of cases and I think the present case falls within the class indicated in the <ORG> cases which have been quoted
