jurisdiction of <ORG> to issue a direction for framing a scheme for regularisation of the employees of <ORG> for short the <ORG> is in question in this batch of appeals which arise out of judgments and orders passed by <ORG> of Judicature at Allahabad in the writ petitions filed by the private respondents either dismissing or allowing the same ACT The legislature of the State of Uttar Pradesh enacted The Uttar Pradesh Krishi Utpadan Mandi Adhiniyam for short the Act Section provides for the constitution of the <ORG> posts were sanctioned but indisputably appointments have been made We are herein concerned with the orders of appointments and orders of terminations issued in respect of about employees who were appointed between the period and A resolution was passed by the <ORG> on or about th September proposing regularisation of the services of those employees who have completed one thousand days of service Approval having been sought for from <ORG> in relation to framing of appropriate rules in this behalf informations were sought for from various departments including <ORG> in regard to the appointments made in past six months by a letter dated th November On or about an order was issued by the <ORG> directing that services of all such employees who had been irregularly appointed during the period to be cancelled on last come first go basis stating The irregular appointment made in the Mandi Parishad and Mandi Samities during the period to should be cancelled immediately The following course should be adopted to terminate such appointments a There is no legal impediment in terminating the service of the employee concerned after cancelling the appointments which have been made without any created sanctioned post but the reason therefor shall have to be recorded in the order There is no legal impediment in terminating the service after cancelling the appointments of such persons as did not have educational qualifications prescribed for the post concerned but the reason therefor should be recorded in the order The termination of service of such persons as have been appointed in relation to some post and also have educational qualification prescribed for that post should be made in accordance with the procedure mentioned in their appointment order In case no procedure is mentioned in the appointments order their service should be terminated after giving either notice or pay in lieu thereof In this regard I have to inform this thing also that after making intensive examination in respect of irregular appointments made in the Mandi Parishad and Mandi Samities before kindly furnish clear report alongwith detailed statement by Further directions were issued on in the following terms In regard to the appointed subject and Semi <ORG> in regard to irregular appointments made on the post of various categories in <ORG> there has been no requirement of prescribed procedure rules In such circumstances the proposal sent to <ORG> In the said letter the opinion of the Chairman of the Board was quoted stating As the action whatsoever taken in this matter will create wide ranging ramifications both political and administrative therefore it will be proper to send the factual report of the whole case to Govt A Division Bench of <ORG> <ORG> put its seal of approval to the order of the learned Single Judge by a judgment and order dated in similar writ petitions filed by other dismissed employees SUBMISSIONS On behalf of the Board Submission of Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the Board are i In terms of the statutory mandate contained in Section of the Act the Board was bound by the directions issued by the <ORG> ii The appointments having been made in utter disregard of the mandatory provisions of the Services Regulations and the Establishment Regulations the employees did not derive any legal right to continue in the said posts iv Indisputably the provisions of Industrial Disputes Act and the rules framed thereunder relating to retrenchment of workmen were complied with and in that view of the mater it cannot be said that the orders of termination passed against the employees were illegal On behalf of the <ORG> Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the <ORG> of Uttar Pradesh submitted that from the records it would appear that the <ORG> adopted a known criterion for cancellation of appointment of such employees who were in the last slots namely to Such orders of termination ensured that the principles of last come first go basis are followed and the employees are paid one month salary in lieu of notice as also days wages for each completed year of service by way of compensation No appointment having been made after the impugned judgment of <ORG> cannot be sustained On behalf of the Writ Petitioners Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the Respondents on the other hand urged i that the appointments of the employees cannot be said to be illegal as the provisions contained in the respective regulations apply to appointments in regular cadre ii There is no embargo in appointing employees on adhoc basis in exigency of service or on work charge basis recognised in the regulations in view of the fact that such employees do not derive the benefits which are granted to the regular employees iii Section of the Act had no application in the facts of the case in view of the fact that appointment of adhoc employees is not a matter which would come within the purview of the functions of the <ORG> as envisaged under Section and of the Act iv By reason of purported directions issued under Section the rights and privileges granted to the employees under other statutes cannot be taken away ix The Board having adopted a resolution to regularise the services of its employees there was no need to obtain any approval from the <ORG> As admittedly no appointment whatsoever was made in terms of the statutory regulations since the inception of constitution of <ORG> the <ORG> could not have ignored the past practice particularly in a case of this nature where the employees concerned have requisite educational qualifications xi The court in such a situation can be said to have the requisite jurisdiction in directing a <ORG> within the meaning of Article of the Constitution of India to make a scheme of regularisation Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of another writ applicant submitted that institutions of the market committees and the <ORG> having their activities principally in rural areas the human problem should not be ignored as without such daily wagers or adhoc employees functions of the statutory body may have to be stopped The learned counsel submitted that the appointments being not void ab initio and of no effect the <ORG> could not have issued directions for termination of their services As the appointments were made having regard to the necessity felt by <ORG> and the <ORG> this Court should not exercise its discretionary jurisdiction under Article of the Constitution of India Mrs <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of <NAME> supplemented the arguments of Mr <NAME> and Mr <NAME> contending that there was no material before the government for issuing the impugned instructions vii The resolution of the Board to regularise services of such employees who have completed one thousand days of service was valid As the writ petitioners have been working in various Committees for a long period ranging from six to nine years termination of their services was arbitrary viii The principles of natural justice have been ignored in terminating the services of such employees and thus the orders terminating the services of the writ petitioners were bad in law They shall be deemed to have continued in service and as such they shall be relegated to their original position <ORG> shall within six months resolve and formulate a policy to deal with the terms of their service by giving due consideration to its earlier resolution regarding regularization of their services However as noticed supra <ORG> of the same Court in its judgment dated opined that the appointments having been made in violation of the statutory regulations the appointees must be held to have entered into service through backdoor and in that view of the matter the <ORG> has the requisite jurisdiction to issue a direction in terms of Section of the Act The judgment of <ORG> dated RELEVANT PROVISIONS OF THE STATUTES Before adverting to the rival contentions we may briefly notice the provisions of the said Act Section of the said Act provides for establishment of a Market <ORG> Fund The proviso appended thereto mandates that annual expenditure in respect of matters specified in clause ii shall not exceed of the total annual receipts of the <ORG> excluding loans raised by it and advances or grants made to it except with the prior approval of the <ORG> Section of the Act occurring in Chapter IV provides for appointments of officers and servants of <ORG> and their conditions of services The appointments of such officers who may be appointed for carrying out the purpose of the Act must be done in terms of the bye laws framed by it Sub section of Section envisages that every <ORG> shall have such number of Secretaries and such other officers as may be considered necessary by the <ORG> for the effective discharge of the functions of the <ORG> appointed by the <ORG> on such terms and conditions as may be provided for in the regulations made by it Chapter of the Act deals with external control Section A empowers the <ORG> to appoint such officers and servants as it considers necessary for efficient performance of its functions on such terms and conditions as may be provided for in the regulations made by the <ORG> Section provides for the powers and functions of the <ORG> Functions of the <ORG> are provided for in Sub section thereof stating i superintendence and control over the working of the Market Committees and other affairs thereof including programmes undertaken by such Committees for the construction of New Market Yards and development of existing Markets and Market Areas ii giving such direction to Committees in general or any Committee in particular with a view to ensure efficiency thereof iii any other function entrusted to it by this Act iv such other functions as may be entrusted to the Board by <ORG> by notification in the <ORG> The powers of the <ORG> have been enumerated under Sub section of Section of the Act which includes to do such other things as may be of general interest to Market Committees or considered necessary for the efficient functioning of the Board as may be specified from time to time by <ORG> Section of the Act empowers <ORG> to issue directions in the following terms In the discharge of its functions the Board shall be guided by such directions on question of policy as may be given to it by <ORG> If any question arises whether any matter is or is not a matter as respects which <ORG> may issue a direction under sub section the decision of <ORG> shall be final Section of the Act provides for accounts and audit Section thereof empowers the <ORG> to make regulations with the previous approval of <ORG> which shall be subject to the said Act and the rules made thereunder Section of the Act confers power upon the <ORG> to call for the proceedings of a <ORG> for the purpose of satisfying itself as regard legality or propriety of a decision or an order or orders and pass order thereon as it may deem fit if it is of the opinion that the decision or order of the <ORG> should be modified annulled or reversed The State Government with a view to satisfying itself that the powers functions and duties of the <ORG> or a <ORG> by or under this Act are exercised or performed by it properly may require the Commissioner or the Collector or any other person or persons to inspect or cause to be inspected any property office document or any work of the <ORG> or the <ORG> or to make inquiries into all or any of the activities of the <ORG> or the <ORG> in such manner as may be prescribed and to report to it the result of such inquiry within such period as may be specified Proviso appended to Section provides that no bye law other than a bye law made by adopting draft or model bye law suggested by the <ORG> shall be valid unless approved by it Section of the Act provides for rule making power The functions duties and powers of the <ORG> in terms of Sections and of the Act have been laid down in Rule Such appointment made by the <ORG> under sub section of Section of the Act for those posts wherefor the <ORG> is the appointing authority shall be intimated within days of the date of such appointments to the Directors or to such officer as may be authorised by the Director in this behalf Regulation defines Employee to mean every person appointed on whole time basis in Classes A and mentioned in Regulation whether on contract basis on deputation or otherwise but does not include persons employed on daily wages work charged and on part time basis Regulation provides for the source of recruitment inter alia providing that per cent posts in lowest grade in Class shall be filled by direct recruitment and per cent by promotion from Class and all the posts in Class shall be filled by direct recruitment Regulation provides for constitution of <ORG> for the purpose of recruitment to Class A and posts whereas Regulation provides for constitution of <ORG> for recruitment to Class and posts Regulation empowers the appointing authority to determine the number of vacancies in all the classes to be filled during the course of the year as also the number of vacancies to be reserved for candidates belonging to Schedules Castes and Scheduled Tribes and other categories under Regulation The other sub regulations contained in Regulation provides for the mode and manner in which such vacancies shall be filled up Regulation provides for determination of vacancies whereas Regulation provides for the procedure of selection by direct recruitment Indisputably <ORG> and the <ORG> have power to appoint officers and servants Section of the Act however imposes further restriction on the power of <ORG> by limiting the annual expenditure made in this regard not exceeding of the total annual receipt of the <ORG> The said regulations provide for detailed procedure for appointment and the terms and conditions therefor No appointment thus can be made in violation of the provisions of statute and statutory rules Submission of the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the employees is that the procedures prescribed by reason of the Regulations are applicable to the regular employees The question which however falls for consideration is as to whether any appointment can be made de hors the provisions of the Act and the rules Our attention has been drawn to the definition of employee which does not include persons employed on daily wages work charged and or part time basis If the expression employee does not bring within its fold any person employed on daily wages work charged or on part time basis the same would mean that the persons so appointed would not be the employees within the meaning of the said regulation It would therefore not be correct to contend that <ORG> or the <ORG> have the jurisdiction to appoint anybody on daily wages work charged or on part time basis de hors the rules The power to make appointments by the committee or the board whether contained in Section or Section of the Act are statutory in nature It implies that although <ORG> may have power to make appointments such appointments can be made in relation to the posts created therefor by the <ORG> wherefor requisite intimation has to be given to the Director or the officer authorised in this behalf They a fortiori derive no legal right to continue in service subject of course to the compliance of the provisions of any other Act or the rules conferring certain benefits to them It is required to be done in terms of the regulation only The power of the <ORG> Government is confined to issue directions on question of policy Such directions were not shown to have been issued pursuant to any decision taken by a competent authority in terms of the Rules of Executive Business of the <ORG> framed under Article of the Constitution of India In that view of the matter if a policy decision is taken by the <ORG> in regard to the appointment or terms and conditions of the servants in the event regulations made in this behalf do not contain any provisions such policy decision must conform to the directions of the <ORG> issued in that behalf if any While granting such advice the <ORG> had taken into consideration the last segment of employment If such directions had been confined to the period to on following certain basic principles like last come first go basis we do not see any reason as to why the same would be termed to be arbitrary or discriminatory The principle of natural justice would be attracted only when the services of some persons are terminated by way of a punitive measure or thereby a stigma is attached It cannot be put in a straitjacket formula It cannot be applied in a vacuum without reference to the relevant facts and circumstances of the case We have noticed hereinbefore the contents of the correspondences passed between the parties When the advice of the Chief Minister and or the <ORG> was sought for the Chief Minister wanted the details of such appointment made within the last six months However at a later stage the validity or otherwise of the appointments made by the Directors of the <ORG> on different periods had been taken into consideration REGULARISATION The direction of <ORG> to frame scheme for regularisation of the employees as also the resolution of the Board to regularise the services of the employees who had completed one thousand days of service must be considered having regard to the aforementioned legal position in mind When questioned Mr <NAME> and Mr <NAME> submitted that regularisation would mean permanence Regularisation of the services of an employee would therefore mean that the concerned persons who had no status within the purview of the definition of employee would become employee It is the <ORG> again that lays down the conditions of service subject of course to a law made by the appropriate legislature This power to prescribe the conditions of service can be exercised either by making rules under the proviso to Article of the Constitution or in the absence of such rules by issuing rules instruct ions in exercise of its executive power The court comes into the picture only to ensure observance of fundamental rights statutory provisions rules and other instructions if any governing the conditions of service It was further held No regularisation is thus permissible in exercise of the statutory power conferred under Article of the Constitution if the appointments have been made in contravention of the statutory rules The power to frame regulations is expressly conferred on the Board in terms of Section of the Act If no appointment could be made by the <ORG> in exercise of its power under Article of the Constitution of India as the same would be in contravention of the statutory rules there cannot be any doubt whatsoever that the <ORG> or for that matter <ORG> cannot make an appointment in violation of the Act and the Regulations framed thereunder It is also not the case of the respondents that they were appointed in accordance with the extant rules Regularisation cannot be claimed as a matter of right All actions of the <ORG> must conform to the constitutional requirements Representations have been made to them that after their training was completed they would be absorbed in regular employment of the <ORG> When the <ORG> was reeling under a strike of its employees these trainee engineers stood by the <ORG> to keep up the generation and distribution of electricity and had been assured of absorption The Court did not lay down any law that regularization would be directed despite the fact appointments had been made in violation of the rules The Bench did not go into the question of validity or otherwise of such a scheme Before this Court a scheme was submitted in terms whereof the scheme had undertaken to regularize work charged employees employed prior to This Court besides the proposals made therein issued certain other directions Therein it was held The contention on behalf of the <ORG> that a rule under Article for regularisation of the appointment of a person would be a form of recruitment read with reference to power under Article is unsound and unacceptable The executive has the power to appoint That power may have its source in Article In the present case the rule which regularised the appointment of the respondent with effect from February notwithstanding any rules cannot be said to be in exercise of power under Article First Article does not speak of rules whereas Article speaks of rules Therefore the present case touches the power of the <ORG> to make rules under Article of the nature impeached here Secondly when the Government acted under Article the Government cannot be said to have acted also under Article in the same breath The two articles operate in different areas Counsel on behalf of the respondent contended that regularisation would mean conferring the quality of permanence on the appointment whereas counsel on behalf of the <ORG> contended that regularisation did dot mean permanence but that it was a case of regularisation of the rules under Article Ratification or regularisation is possible of an act which is within the power and province of the authority but there has been some non compliance with procedure or manner which does not go to the root of the appointment To accede to such a proposition would be to introduce a new head of appointment in defiance of rules or it may have the effect of setting at naught the rules The said decision has been noticed in various judgments referred to hereinbefore It was observed that if the direct recruitment takes place on one hand and substituted teachers are also directed to be regularized subsequently it would create an enormous problem for the department to accommodate both the categories of persons and in the aforementioned situation in exercise of its power under Article of the Constitution of India this Court with a view to avoid further litigation and also to avoid seemingly conflicting interim orders issued by <ORG> gave certain directions Such directions having evidently been issued by this Court in exercise of its power under Article of the Constitution of India do not constitute a binding precedent Even therein the scope and ambit of this Court jurisdiction under Article vis vis existence of the statue and statutory rules and the constitutional mandate contained in Articles and of the Constitution of India had not been taken into consideration On the other hand in a series of decisions which we have noticed hereinbefore this <ORG> has now firmly laid down the law that regularization cannot be a mode of appointment OTHER CONTENTIONS Mr <NAME> has placed strong reliance upon the provisions of the Regularisation of Adhoc Appointments on Posts Outside the Purview of the Public Service Commission Rules purported to have been framed by the State in pursuance of the provisions of Clause of Article of the Constitution of India ii possessed requisite qualifications prescribed for regular appointment as the time of such ad hoc appointment and iii has completed or as the case may be after he has completed three years service shall be considered for regular appointments in permanent or temporary vacancy as may be available on the basis of his record and suitability before any regular appointment is made in such vacancy in accordance with the relevant rules or orders In making regular appointments under these rules reservations for the candidates belonging to the Scheduled Castes Scheduled Tribes Backward Classes and other categories shall be made in accordance with the orders of the <ORG> in force at the time of recruitment The appointing authority shall prepare an eligibility list of the candidates arranged in order of seniority as determined from the date of order of appointment and if two or more persons are appointed together from the order in which their names are arranged in the said appointment order the list shall be placed before <ORG> along with the character rolls and such other records of the candidates as may be considered necessary to assess their suitability <ORG> shall prepare a list of the selected candidates the names in the list being arranged in order of seniority and forward it to the appointing authority Submission of Mr <NAME> to take recourse to Regulation of the Establishment Regulations providing that in regard to the matters not specifically covered by the rules persons appointed to the services of the <ORG> shall be governed by the regulations applicable generally to the <ORG> employees is misconceived The said submission of Mr <NAME> is furthermore inconsistent with his submissions as noticed supra that even in terms of Section of the Act <ORG> had no power to issue any direction governing appointment in respect of terms and conditions of the services of the employees Persons who may be appointed to the services of the Board furthermore even according to the learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the Respondents are those who are regular employees having been appointed in terms of the provisions of the Act and the Regulations framed thereunder We have therefore no doubt in our mind that Regulation of the Establishment Regulations which is in Chapter VII of the Act refers to only such regulations and orders which would be applicable to the regular employees The fact that all appointments have been made without following the procedure or services of some persons appointed have been regularised in past in our opinion cannot be said to be a normal mode which must receive the seal of the court The <ORG> and the <ORG> were bound to take steps in accordance with law It may be that from the very inception the provisions of the Act and the Regulations framed thereunder had been given a complete go by It is also true as has been contended by Mr <NAME> and Mr <NAME> that the power to create posts was with the <ORG> but the <ORG> did not exercise its power nor the competent authorities of <ORG> proceeded to appoint employees on the sweet will of the concerned authorities without in any way bothering for the provisions of the Act and the Rules framed thereunder The officers of the local authorities had a bounden duty not only to act within the four corners of the statute but having regard to the constitutional scheme in mind As appointments had been made de hors the rules and without following the procedures known in law and in flagrant violation of constitutional scheme as laid down in Articles and of the Constitution of India the appointments although might have been made in exigencies of services they must be held to be wholly illegal and without jurisdiction An attempt has been made by the Respondents to show that the income of <ORG> has increased from Rs The availability of funds is not and cannot be a valid ground to make the appointments of persons without proper sanction and creation of posts and cannot be taken to be an excuse to perpetuate illegalities A contention has been raised by Mrs <NAME> that there was no material before the <ORG> for issuing the impugned instructions insofar as the financial position vis vis the strength of the employees had been taken into consideration It is not necessary for us to go into the aforementioned question inasmuch as we are herein concerned with the legality and or validity of the impugned orders of termination of services and the same having not been done the appointment of the concerned employees were wholly illegal and without jurisdiction and thus void and of no effect ii The <ORG> had no jurisdiction to frame any scheme for regularization in the pith of the statutory regulations operating in the field Any legislation involving appointment or laying down the conditions of service of the employees would require prior sanction of the <ORG> Availability of vacancies and or the fund by themselves would not allow <ORG> or the <ORG> to make appointments in flagrant violation of the statutory provisions Mr <NAME> appearing on behalf of the <ORG> has assured us that the <ORG> shall look into cases of such employees whose termination has been effected beyond the policy decision taken by the <ORG> although we do not intend to express any opinion as regards such employees We however direct the <ORG> and <ORG> to fill up all existing vacancies strictly in accordance with law as expeditiously as possible and preferably within six months from date In the offers of appointment which may be issued to such temporary or ad hoc employees it shall be made clear that their appointments would be ad hoc in nature and the same shall be co terminus with the appointment of regular employees In view of our findings aforementioned we are of the opinion that the judgment and order dated passed by the learned Single Judge which has been upheld by the Division Bench by its order dated does not lay down the law correctly and the judgment and order dated passed by a Division Bench of the Lucknow Bench of <ORG> in Writ Petition No of lays down the law correctly In the result Civil Appeal arising out of SLP No of is dismissed and other civil appeals filed by the <ORG> and the State of Uttar Pradesh as also civil appeal arising out of SLP No of filed by the <ORG> are allowed
