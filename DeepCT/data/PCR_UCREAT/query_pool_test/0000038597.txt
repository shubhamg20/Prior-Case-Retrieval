The facts which are necessary for the disposal of the appeal may be stated briefly as under Prior to th September the recruitment to the posts of Sales Tax Inspectors for short STIs was made through three sources by promotion from clerks by transfer from other departments and by direct recruitment Till this time no quota was prescribed for these three different sources of recruitment For the first time <ORG> in exercise of powers conferred by provisions of Article of the Constitution of India framed the rules called Maharashtra Sales Tax Inspectors Recruitment Rules for short Rules which came into force September Appointment to the posts of Sales Tax Inspectors shall be made either a by promotion of suitable clerks in the Sales Tax Depart ment who have passed at least Part of the Departmental Ex amination prescribed for the Sales Tax Inspector or for the Higher Clerical staff in <ORG> or who have been exempted from passing the Departmental Examination prescribed for Sales Tax Inspectors or for the High Clerical Staff Provided that the Clerks who have passed Part I of the Departmental Examination for Sales Tax Inspector and who have been promoted to the posts of Sales Tax Inspectors are required to pass Part II of the Departmental Examination for Sales Tax Inspector also according to the rules made in that behalf failing which they shall be liable to be reverted The ratio shall not apply to temporary vacancies not exceeding one year which may be filled by promotion Note In the period from the date on which these rules come into force to the date on which the results of the first Departmental Examination of Sales Tax Inspectors under the unified Departmen tal Examination Rules are declared promotions made to the post of Sales Tax Inspector shall be purely provisional and persons so promoted shall be required to pass the prescribed Departmental Examination within the prescribed period from the date the Departmental Examination rules come into force failing which they shall be liable to be reverted by nomination on the result of a competitive examination held by <ORG> from among can didates who i possess a degree in Arts Science Commerce Law or Agriculture of a recognised University or any recognised equivalent qualifications and ii have attained the age of years and have not attained the age of years on the first day of the month immediately following the month in which the posts are advertised by the <ORG> Provided that the upper age limit shall be relaxed upto years in the case of persons serving in <ORG> The said Rules were called Maharashtra Civil Services Regulation of Seniority Rules for short Rules These rules came into force June Rule is relevant in the present controversy and it reads thus General Principles of Seniority Subject to the other provisions of these rules the seniority of a Government servant in any post cadre or service shall ordinarily be determined on the length of his continuous service there Provided that for the purpose of computing such service any period of absence from the post cadre or service due to leave deputation for training or otherwise or on foreign service or temporary officiation in any other post shall be taken into account if the competent authority certified that the <ORG> servant concerned would have continued in the said post cadre or service during such period had he not proceeded on leave or deputation Or been appointed temporarily to such other post Provided further that the service if any rendered by him as a result of a fortuitous appointment shall be excluded in computing the length of service and for the purposes of seniority he shall be deemed to have been appointed to the post in the cadre of service on the date on which his regular appointment is made in accordance with the provisions of the relevant recruitment rules Where the dates of appointment in posts cadre or service of any two or more persons determined after assigning the deemed dates if necessary are identical the person senior in age shall be considered as senior for the purpose of deter mining the seniority Rule contains several definitions and we are concerned with for a defini tions Deemed date means the date assigned to a Government servant in accordance with the provisions of Rub Direct recruit means in relation to any post cadre or service a person appointed by nomination thereto fortuitous appointment means a temporary appointment made pending a regular appointment in accordance with the provisions of the relevant recruitment rules Promotee means In relation to any post cadre or service a Government servant appointed thereto by promotion from a lower post cadre or service The State of Maharashtra again in exercise of its powers conferred by Article of the Constitution of India carried out the amendments to the Rules We may reproduce the relevant amendments to Rules and which read as under in Rule of the Maharashtra Civil Services Regulation of Seniority Rules hereinafter referred to as the principle rules in sub rule in the second proviso after the words a fortuitous appointment the following shall be inserted namely except in a case where the competent authority certifies that it was not expedient possible or practicable to make a regular ap pointment strictly in accordance with the ratio of recruitment as prescribed in the relevant recruitment rules with the brief reason recorded therefor This is how the relevant rules were holding the field when the impugned seniority list as amended came to be published in the year and It is clear from the certificate of the Addl Commissioner of Sales Tax dated st February Ex The principle issue which needs to be considered in this appeal is how to determine the seniority amongst the promotees and direct recruits who were promoted and appointed as STIs during this block The contention raised on behalf of the promotees appellants is that the quota rule was broken down and as a result thereof the promotees were required to be appointed in view of the exigencies of service and if so appointed their promotions cannot be termed as for tuitous temporary ad hoc and that they will be entitled to earn the seniority and placement in the impugned seniority list from the date they were so promoted and working as STIs As against this the contention raised on behalf of the direct recruits was that the promotees who were promoted appointed in the vacancies falling in the quota of direct recruits such promotions of the promotees were fortuitous in excess of their quota and notwithstanding that they were so appointed and working as STIs in the vacancies reserved for direct recruits as per the quota rule they cannot get the seniority from the date of promotion or officiation and that they will get their placement in the seniority list in accordance with their quota i and until they are accommodated in their quota as regular promotees their date of promotion or officiation will not be counted for the purposes of fixing their seniority vis a vis direct recruits The direct recruits therefore prayed that present A has no substance and the same be dismissed It would be necessary to refer to the earlier proceedings which were finally disposed of by the <ORG> Bombay Bench and this Court upheld the said judgment while dismissing the SLP filed by promotees departmental candidates The State of Maharashtra pleaded that the seniority list issued on th April was in accordance with the statutory rules and the promotions given to the promotees in excess of their quota were required to be treated as fortuitous promotions and since they were not regularly appointed as STIs they will be pushed down below the direct recruits for the respective unit years of appointments in accordance with quota rule According to the State of Maharashtra the promotions given to the promotees in excess of quota were temporary ad hoc and or stop gap arrangement without reckoning the period of their officiation as STIs for the purposes of fixing their seniority The promotees strongly relied upon circular issued by the govern ment on nd September regarding the seniority of <ORG> with reference to the rules and principles of seniority between the promotees and direct recruits There is a dispute as regards the correct reading and inter pretation of this certificate dated st February The direct recruits were also made parties to this A <ORG> <ORG> vide its impugned Judgment dated rd March dismissing the A It is against this order passed by <ORG> <ORG> the appellants have filed this CM Appeal No of The impugned judgment principally proceeded on the footing that the contentions raised by the appellants were barred by principle of res judicata in view of the earlier decision of the <ORG> <ORG> rendered on rd September whereunder the seniority list dated April came to be quashed The <ORG> then directed concerned authority to prepare a fresh seniority list in terms of directions contained in its order dated September The <ORG> gave the findings on merits in order to avoid the order of remand in the event the higher court comes to the conclusion that the contentions raised by the appellants in Before we deal with the rival contentions on merits it would be appropriate to set out relevant contentions and the findings recorded thereof by the <ORG> <ORG> in its judgment dated September as to whether the contentions raised in the present proceedings are barred by res judicata constructive res judicata The principle of res judicata is sought to be applied on the footing that the identical contentions were raised in Transfer Petition No of and therefore such contentions cannot be re agitated in the present QA To this A four more promotees got themselves impleaded as interveners and filed their counter affidavit opposing the said The contention raised on behalf of direct recruits was that the promo tions given to the promotees in excess of their quota as laid down in the Rules be treated as fortuitous beyond their prescribed quota If such promotions were given to the promotees they could not be said to be fortuitous ad hoc temporary or stop gap arrangement It cannot be held that the quota rule has not been followed continuously for number of years Year is taken as unit for deciding the quota The <ORG> while coining to the above conclusions noticed that there was no material on record to indicate that the quota rule was broken down and therefore the promotions given to the promotees in excess of quota rule will have to be treated as regular promotions and not being fortuitous ad hoc temporary stop gap arrangement The words as far as practicable appearing in Rule of Rules could not be equated with impossible and for that the <ORG> had referred to the number of vacancies that fell to the share of direct recruits No material was produced on record to indicate that govern ment ever took a conscious decision to deviate from the quota rule as it was broken down and therefore promotees were required to be promoted in excess of their quota The Government had taken no active steps in the direction of direct recruitment The promotions given to the promotees in excess of their quota were either fortuitous fid hoc tem porary or stop gap arrangement and therefore notwithstanding that such promotees were officiating for long period they will have to be pushed down in the seniority list below the direct recruits for the respective year of recruitment Consistent with these findings the <ORG> concluded thus It has not been explained by the respondents whether the seniority list published by the Additional Commissioner <ORG> vide his letter dated th April is in accordance with the instructions issued by the <ORG> vide <ORG> letter dated nd September It is needless to soy that the appointments made in excess of the quota will have to be treated as fortuitous It is this seniority list which was challenged by the appellants before the <ORG> <ORG> in Original Application No A of The <ORG> <ORG> vide its judg ment and order dated rd March dismissed the said A The case of the appellants is that the said expression was inserted in the proviso with the object of avoiding fractions in arithmetical calculations of number of posts available to the two groups and for no other purpose We do not see any reason to so restrict the scope and meaning of the expression as far as practicable While construing the phrase as far as practicable in the manner suggested by the respondents it must be indicated that serious efforts were made with all promptness on the part of the <ORG> to secure the hands to fill up the required number of vacancies from the open market In view of these findings a similar contention sought to be raised in the present proceedings cannot be entertained and the <ORG> in our opinion has rightly negatived the said contention on the ground of res judicata An equally unsustainable contention was raised on behalf of the appellant that the aforesaid finding is per incuriam and as such the prin ciple of res judicata will have no application We wonder how this contention can be accepted in view of the specific finding recorded by the <ORG> in its judgment dated September which is quoted herein above It was then contended on behalf of the appellants that neither the recruitment rules of nor the seniority rules of provided for carrying forward the vacancies falling in either category Neither the contesting respondents nor the appellants ever raised this contention at any stage of the proceedings in Transfer Petition No of It was then contended on behalf of the appellants that in the year the Recruitment Rules were amended and as per the amended rules cases where appointments are not made strictly in accordance with the ratio of recruitment as prescribed in the Rules such appointments will not be fortuitous appointments if the competent authority certified that it was not expedient possible or practicable to make a regular appointment strictly in accordance with the ratio In support of this submission reliance was placed on the certificate dated st February issued by <ORG> in terms of the amended Rules On the contrary this certificate unmistakably indicates that although it was issued on st February the promotions given to the promotees in excess of their quota for the respective unit years were treated as temporary promotions No document is brought to our notice to indicate that <ORG> has ever taken any decision much less the conscious decision in accordance with law to treat the promotions of these promotees in excess of the quota on regular basis The respon dents were therefore justified in contending that this issue cannot be agitated in the present proceedings as it is barred under the principle of constructive res judicata It was contended by Mr <NAME> the learned Senior Counsel that the petitioners in Case No of sued the respondent Nos and in a representative capacity and therefore the law laid down by the <ORG> Bombay Bench in Transfer Petition No of must bind all the promotees who are similarly situated This contention raised on behalf of appellants was negatived by the <ORG> in its impugned judgment and held that the said Transfer Petition by the direct recruits was in the representative capacity We see no reason to doubt the findings of the <ORG> in this behalf which is supported by Mr <NAME> Lastly it was contended on behalf of the appellants that some of the appellants have put in more than years of service when few of the direct recruits were either schooling and or not born in the cadre If the appellants were to be pushed down it will cause a great hardship to them We are unable to subscribe to this contention because if there is patent violation of the quota rule the result must follow and the appellants who remained in the office for all these years cannot take the advantage of this situation Thus we concur with the findings recorded by the <ORG> on the issue of res judicata and consequently the A No A of will have to be dismissed on this ground alone for the reasons recorded herein above It is expressly made clear that this judgment is confined to the seniority list as on st December and no more In view of the aforesaid discussion we find no merit in this appeal and the same is dismissed In the circumstances of the case parties are directed to bear their own costs This writ petition was filed by the first respondent <NAME> the Sales Tax Inspector for short STI on behalf of himself and other similarly situated STIs who were promoted to the posts of STIs prior to September It is this provisional seniority list which was quashed by <ORG> by this impugned order and <ORG> was directed to prepare a fresh seniority list of STIs in accordance with the directions contained therein The posts of STIs are filled up by promotion as well as nomination in equal ratio Promotion to the STI from the cadre of Clerk was made from the suitable candidates on the basis of the certificate issued by <ORG> about his suitability The posts were equated as under The post of <NAME> Senior Clerk in the service of <ORG> was equated with the post of Senior Clerk in <ORG> as the scale for both these posts was identical i Rs While determining the seniority of such absorbed employees vis a vis the employees in <ORG> working on the post of Senior Clerks the Govern ment of Maharashtra <ORG> by Resolution dated June determined the norms of fixation of the seniority and it reads thus So far as terms and conditions regarding fixation of seniority are concerned the seniority of the revenue staff in the post of absorp tion should be fixed from the date from which such persons are working regularly in the equated posts prior to their absorption for all purposes including promotions confirmation etc The said order also recites that the seniority of the <ORG> staff in the post of absorption will be separately fixed from the date from which such persons were working regularly in the equated posts prior to their absorption for all purposes including promotions confirmations etc These employees who were absorbed in <ORG> were holding the posts of Senior Clerk <NAME> <NAME> Entertain ment Duty Inspectors etc in <ORG> and since their scale was found to be equivalent to the Senior Clerk in the Sales Tax Depart ment they were absorbed in the cadre of Senior Clerk in <ORG> The respondents herein the writ petitioners and other similarly situated clerks and Senior Clerks who were working in <ORG> were promoted from October onwards to the posts of STIs against regular vacancies Respondents to who were absorbed from <ORG> in <ORG> in the cadre of Senior Clerk were also promoted to the post of Sales Tax Inspectors in August The <ORG> issued a circular enclosing the list of persons in <ORG> who were promoted from the post of Senior Clerks between and From the material placed on record it is noticed that the employees who were initially working in <ORG> and were absorbed in <ORG> were making representations to <ORG> to reckon their seniority in the cadre of STIs by taking into account their service seniority in the cadre of Senior Clerk in their parent department It is this provisional seniority list which was challenged by the first respondent on behalf of himself and similarly situated STIs who were promoted between and The appellants herein and also the respondents to contested the claim of the first respondent on the ground that in view of the decision of the Government to absorb the Senior Clerks <NAME> <NAME> Entertainment Duty Inspectors etc The Resolution nowhere provides that seniority can have any effect while determining the seniority in the higher cadre of Sales Tax Inspector The effect of the impugned provisional seniority list dated April would be that the respondent Nos to who were absorbed personnel and who were promoted as the Sales Tax Inspectors after would be senior to those STIs like the first respon dent and other similarly situated persons who were promoted after selec tion prior to September <ORG> accordingly set aside the impugned provisional seniority list and directed <ORG> to prepare fresh seniority list in accordance with the directions contained in the impugned judgment In the result the appeal to stand dismissed with costs
