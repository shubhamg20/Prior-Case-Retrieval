HEADNOTE The appellant landlord filed a civil suit against the respondent tenant for possession of a shop which had been rented out by him in The suit was filed on the basis that the respondent was in arrears of rent from lst December to st May that the tenancy had been terminated by giving a suit notice and that section of the Haryana Urban Control of Rent and Eviction Act exempted the building from the purview of the Act The respondent preferred a revision petition to <ORG> which held that as the suit had not been decreed within the period of years the building in question came within the operation of the Act and as such PG NO PG NO the rent Act was applicable and <ORG> had no jurisdiction Allowing the appeal and remanding the case HELD a The rights of the parties will have to be determined on the basis of the rights available to them on the date of the suit The Judgment and Order of <ORG> set aside and order of the Sub Judge restored Those provisions world not be applicable under Section to a suit instituted within years from the date of the completion of the building in question Actus curiam neminem gravabit an act of <ORG> shall prejudice no man It is common knowledge that unless a suit is instituted soon after the date of letting it world never be disposed of within years and even then within that time it may not be disposed of Such suit or proceedings must be instituted within the stipulated period of years The fairest and most rational method to interpret the will of the legislator is by exploring his intentions at the time when the law was made by signs most natural and probable and these signs are either the words the context the subject matter the effects and consequences or the spirit and reasons of the law The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> <NAME> Special leave granted The suit was filed on the basis that the respondent was in arrears of rent from lst December to lst May and the tenancy of the respondent had been terminated by giving him notice The suit was filed for recovery of possession on the termination or expiry of the period of tenancy The Act was passed with the object to control the increase of rent of certain buildings and rented land situated within the limits of urban areas and the eviction of tenants therefrom For our present purpose it would suffice if we bear in mind two relevant provisions Section of the Act provides as follows Nothing in this Act shall apply to any building the construction of which is completed on or after the commencement of this Act for a period of ten years from the date its completion Section of the Act deals with the eviction of tenants and sub section thereof provides that the tenant in possession of a building or a rented land shall not be evicted therefrom except in accordance with the provisions of that section The section thereafter enumerates the statutory grounds for eviction upon which eviction is permitted which incidentally are more or less similar statutory ground all over the country In the PG NO premises the learned Judge of <ORG> dismissed the suit pending before the Sub Judge Aggrieved thereby the appellant has come up in appeal to this Court The only point that was urged before this Court in that decision was whether the premises which was not ten years old on the date of the suit and was exempted from the operation of the new Rent Act could be governed by it if ten years expired during the pendency of the litigation The relevant provisions of the Urban Buildings Regulation of Letting Rent and Eviction Act provided as follows Provided that nothing in this sub section shall bar a suit for the eviction of a tenant on the determination of his tenancy by efflux of time where the tenancy for a fixed term was entered into by or in pursuance of a compromise or adjustment arrived at with reference to a suit appeal revision or execution proceeding which is either recorded in court or otherwise reduced to writing and signed by the tenant The tenant had resisted the claim on the ground that having regard to the date of construction of the building it was covered by the Act that the plaint having not been amended so as to bring the suit under the Act it was barred by section and that term was no default in payment of rent As mentioned hereinbefore during the pendency of the litigation the exemption granted under section expired The question was whether the premises which was not ten years old on the PG NO date of the suit and was exempted from the operation of the Rent Act would be governed by it if ten years expired during the pendency of the litigation Allowing the appeal this Court held that the appellant must get benefits of the Act which became applicable to the premises in question during the pendency of the litigation It was held that the contention that the Court had to decide the case on the basis of cause of action that accrued prior to the date of filing the suit and not on a new cause of action was not sustainable It was further held that normally amendment in plaint is not allowed if it changes the causes of action However where the amendment does not constitute an addition of a new cause of action or raise a new case but amounts to no more than adding to the facts already on the record the amendment would be allowed even after the statutory period of limitation This Court further hold that if a tenant is entitled to the advantage of sections and of the Act and the period of years elapses during the pendency of the eviction suit or appeal before this Court which is the continuation of the suit then the tenant would be entitled to the benefits of the Act It was held that during the pendency of the litigation even if years expired the restriction under section will not be attracted as the suit had been instituted within years It is well settled that the rights of the parties will have to be determined on the basis of the rights available to them on the date of the suit This Court referred to the words used in section of the said Act which emphasised that no suit shall be instituted for eviction This clearly indicates that the restriction put under section of the said Act is to the institution of the suit itself and therefore it is clear that if the provision of PG NO this Act applies then no suit for eviction can be instituted except on the grounds specified in the sub sections of that section of the Act This applies more so in the instant case where the section of the Act provides that the tenant in possession of a building or a rented land shall not be evicted therefrom except in accordance with the provisions of this section Those provisions would not be applicable to a suit instituted within years from the date of the completion of the building in question So much so a landlord who had let out his new building could recover possession with out impediment if he instituted such proceedings within ten years of completion It is well settled that no man should suffer because of the fault of the <ORG> or delay in the procedure <NAME> has stated the maxim actus curiam neminem gravabit an act of <ORG> shall prejudice no man It is common knowledge that unless a suit is instituted soon after the date of letting it would never be disposed of within years and even then within that time it may not be disposed of <NAME> tells us that the fairest and most rational method to interpret the will of the legislator is by exploring his inten tions at PG NO the time when the law was made by signs most natural and probable It appears therefore that though we are concerned with seeking of intention we are rather looking to the meaning of the words that the legislator has used and the true meaning of what words as was said by Lord <NAME> in <ORG> <ORG> Appeal Cases at We are clearly of the opinion that having regard to the language we must find the reason and the spirit of the law Such suit or proceeding must be instituted within the stipulated period of years The judgment and order of <ORG> are set aside and the order of the learned Sub Judge is restored
