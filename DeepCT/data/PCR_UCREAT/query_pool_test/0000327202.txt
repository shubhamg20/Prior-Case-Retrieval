The petitioners in each of these two special civil applications are the same namely a limited company carrying on business of manufacturing textile cloth in Ahmedabad The two special civil applications refer to separate notices issued by the second respondent in each of these special civil application under section a of the Income tax Act seeking to reopen assessments for different years and the grounds on which the assessments are sought to be re opened are identical The petitioners challenge these notices under section of the Act of seeking to re open assessments under section The assessments of the petitioners for the assessment years to were completed in due course At the time of assessment according to the petitioners they had disclosed truly and fully all particulars necessary for the grants of depreciation allowance and had also furnished the relevant particulars of sale of assets in the respective assessment years as and when such sales took place By his letter dated March the second respondent intimated to the petitioners that he intended to initiate proceedings against the petitioners under section a of the Act of in respect of assessment years to the corresponding accounting years being to This action was proposed because according to the second respondent the petitioners had been granted excessive depreciation allowance in assessment years to and the second respondent further stated in the said letter that certain capital gains arising on transfer of assets had not been assessed in assessment years to By the letter dated March the petitioners intimated to the second respondent that the action proposed to be taken by the second respondent was without jurisdiction and or without authority of law The petitioners further contended that no income had escaped assessment by reason of failure or omission on the part of the petitioners to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for the assessments for the relevant years Thereafter two notices both dated March were issued by the second respondent Those notices were in respect of assessment years and and they were issued under section of the Income tax Act These notices were issued as according to the second respondent income chargeable to tax for the said two assessments years had escaped assessment within the meaning of section of the Act and the second respondent proposed to reassess the income for the said assessment years and had called upon the petitioners to submit returns in the prescribed form Thereafter on January two further notices were issued by the second respondent in respect of assessment years and and these notices exhibit collectively to Special Civil Application No of have been challenged in that special civil application The total depreciation which included the aforesaid amount of initial depreciation allowed up to the assessment years in fact exceeded the total cost of the said machineries In order to appreciate the rival contentions at this stage it is necessary to refer to some of the provisions of the Indian Income tax Act hereinafter referred to as the Act of Under the second paragraph of clause vi where the building have been newly erected or the machinery or plant being new has been installed after the st day of March and before the first day of April a further sum which was however not to be deductible in determining the written down value for the purposes of the clause in respect of the year of erection or installation was to be allowed the aggregate of all allowance in respect of depreciation made under this clause and clause via or under any Act repealed hereby or under the Indian Income tax Act II of shall in no case exceed the original cost to the assessee of the building machinery plant or furniture as the case may be Thus under the Act of depreciation of three kinds could be allowed namely ordinary depreciation initial depreciation which was granted in the first year of installation but which was not to be taken into consideration for the purpose of arriving at the written down value and additional depreciation which was climbable for a period of five years but which like ordinary depreciation was to be taken into consideration for the purpose of working out the written down value Under section of the Act of the written down value in the case of assets acquired before the previous year was to be the actual cost to the assessee less all depreciation actually allowed to him under that Act or any Act repealed thereby or under executive orders issued when the Indian Income tax Act was in force granted for the assessment year the aggregate of depreciation allowance whether ordinary or initial granted in respect of that block of machinery exceeded the original cost to the petitioner company of that block of machinery and according to the second respondent in that letter of March excess depreciation was granted to the petitioner company by Rs It is obvious that since the provisions of section could not be invoked because the period of limitation of four years from the assessment years under consideration had expired and since there was a period of eight year even for invoking the provisions of section a of the Act of the second respondent proposed to confine his action to the depreciation allowance granted to the petitioner company during the assessment years to because those four years would be within the period of eight years immediately preceding March The second ground for which reopening of the assessment was proposed was that some machinery was sold during assessment years to and half of the profits estimated under section had been allowed and the sale proceeds had been charged as a balancing charge only to the extent of half instead of full bow there was no written down cost of the oldest machinery and also the said balance of sale price i half of the said profits was charged as profits under section of the Act of and the second respondent proposed to reopen the assessments for assessment years to for these two purpose namely for the excess depreciation allowance allowed during these respective four years and also in connection with the balancing charge of the sale proceeds which were not fully taxed under section Under that sub section where any building machinery plant or furniture which is owned by the assessee and which was or has been used for the purpose of business or profession is sold discarded demolished or destroyed and the moneys payable in respect of such building machinery plant or furniture as the case may be together with the amount of scrap value if any exceed the written down value so much of the excess as does not exceed the difference between the actual cost and the written down value shall be chargeable to Income tax as income of the business of profession of the previous year in which the moneys payable for the building machinery plant or furniture became due and if there is any surplus still left then it would be charged as capital gains under section of the Act of As <NAME> and <NAME> in the Commentaries on Income tax Law edition have pointed out at page Where any allowance or deduction had earlier been made in respect of any loss expenditure or trading liability and subsequently the assessee has obtained or realised any amount towards such loss expenditure or trading liability section deems such realisation etc The authors illustrated the problem in this manner Let the original cost of the building be taken as and depreciation already allowed in respect thereof be taken as On sale etc The necessity to keep section as a provision in addition to section arises from the fact that in its very nature depreciation is neither loss nor expenditure nor a trading which are the subject matter of section It is against this background of the provisions of law that we have to consider the validity of the notices issued under section of the Act of Following the practice adopted in the past of it is considered as profit under section of the Act i Rs The question therefore that we have to consider is whether there was any escapement of income from assessment by reason of any failure or omission on the part of the assessee to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for the assessment of the petitioner for the relevant year As regards the question under section it obvious that it is because the old practice which was being followed by the Income tax department for several years in connection with the computation of the profit under section was discontinued that the second respondent proposed to reopen the assessment regarding the profits under section in these three years Merely because the Income tax authorities changed their practice or started applying the provisions of section in full force it cannot be said that that part of the sale proceeds which was deemed income as profit under section escaped assessment by reason of any omission or failure on the part of the assessee that it the petitioner to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for the assessment for the assessment year under consideration The question therefore remains whether failure on the part of the petitioner to mention the amount of initial depreciation that had been allowed to the petitioner company under the provision of section vi second paragraph in the earlier years amounted to failure or omission on its part to disclose fully and truly all material fats necessary for the assessment in the years under consideration It is true that excess depreciation had been allowed to the petitioner company that is depreciation allowance in excess of what was permissible to it in view of the provisions of section vi proviso clause inasmuch as the aggregate of all depreciation allowance ordinary allowance plus initial depreciation allowance was in excess of the original cost and therefore it cannot be gainsaid that by virtue of excess depreciation allowance having been granted income chargeable to tax had escaped assessment The question however is whether there was any omission of failure on the part of the petitioner to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for its assessments inasmuch as the amount of initial depreciation was not disclosed by it to the Income tax Officer at the time of the assessment for the relevant year and secondly whether the income had escaped assessment by reason of such omission or failure on the part of the petitioner company because it is only if the income has escaped assessment by reason of such omission or failure on the part of the petitioner company that the Income tax Officer can have reason to believe that by reason of such omission of failure on the part of the petitioner company income chargeable to tax had escaped assessment and then only the Income tax Officer the second respondent herein would get jurisdiction to proceed under section a At page <NAME> as he then was delivering the judgment of <ORG> has pointed out Section confers jurisdiction upon the Income tax Officer to issue a notice in respect of the assessment beyond the period of four years but within a period of eight years from the end of the relevant years if two conditions exist that the Income tax Officer has reason to believe that income profits or gains chargeable to Income tax had been under assessed and that he has also reason to believe that such under assessment has occurred by reason of either i omission or failure on the part of an assessee to make a return of his income under section or ii omission or failure on the part of an assessee to disclose fully and truly all material fats necessary for his assessment for that year These conditions are cumulative and precedent to the exercise of jurisdiction to issue a notice of reassessment We are in the present case concerned with the second condition namely that the Income tax Officer must have reason to believe that income escaped assessment or there was under assessment by reason of omission of failure on the part of the assessee to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for his assessment for that year It is no doubt true that if the Income tax Officer had consulted his own records he could have found out without the least trouble as to what initial depreciation had been allowed in respect of the different items of machinery and what depreciation had been allowed from year to year in respect of that piece of machinery and thus by looking at his own records for the previous years the Income tax Officer could very easily have ascertained whether the aggregate of all depreciation whether initial or ordinary or additional allowed in respect of that particular piece of machinery Apparently the Income tax Officer had not consulted his own records and had not checked up whether the aggregate of all depreciation ordinary initial or additional when combined together exceeded the original cost of the piece of machinery to the petitioner company A similar case came up for consideration before <ORG> in Special Civil Application No of decided by a Division Bench on August There <ORG> <ORG> and <ORG> were concerned with the following facts The petitioner was a public limited company carrying on business of manufacturing pottery and sanitary were and in respect of assessment year the petitioner filed its return of income before the Income tax Officer It was subsequently realised that because of the omission to take into consideration the initial depreciation excess depreciation allowance had been granted to the assessee for assessment years and and the Income tax Officer started reassessment proceedings under section a and at that stage the Special Civil Application was filed in this court Two contentions were urged before <ORG> namely whether the assessee was bound during the course of the Previous assessment proceeding to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for its assessment for the relevant years to the assessing authority although such material was admittedly on the record of the department and it was not exclusively within the knowledge of the assessee and whether on a true and proper interpretation of section a of the Act the jurisdiction of the Income tax Officer to reassess income that had escaped assessment or to recompute loss or depreciation allowance was affected in case where the material necessary for the assessment in respect of which the alleged omission or failure to disclose had occurred is such as could have been gathered by him from an investigation into the records of the department <ORG> observed Since the fact that initial depreciation allowance was granted to the petitioner in respect of certain items of its capital assets is admittedly a material fact for the purpose of the assessment of the petitioner it was bound to disclose the said fact to the Income tax Officer during the course of the previous assessment proceedings to enable the assessing authority to determine the true amount of the allowance to which it was entitled <ORG> therefore rejected the submission made on behalf of the petitioner that since the fact that initial depreciation in respect of certain items of the capital assets of the petitioner was granted to the petitioner under section vi of the Act was already on the record of the department and could have been found out by the Income tax Officer during the course of the previous assessment proceeding by investigation of the record there was no obligation on the part of the petitioner to disclose the said material in the course of its previous assessment proceedings and there was therefore no failure or omission on the part of the petitioner to disclose fully and truly all material necessary for his assessment for the relevant years within the meaning of section a of the Act In view of this <ORG> judgment with which we are in agreement it is obvious that the petitioner in the present case must be held to have omitted or to have failed to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for the assessment of the petitioner company for assessment years to by failing to refer to the grant of initial depreciation that had been granted to it in the past and we well proceed in the course of this judgment on the footing that at least as regards the excess of depreciation allowance granted to it in the past such excess depreciation was allowed and therefore income had escaped assessment for these different years under consideration but the question that still remains to be considered is whether the income chargeable to tax so far as the petitioner was concerned had escaped assessment by reason of the omission or failure on the part of the petitioner to disclose fully and truly such material facts Just as there was an obligation on the part of the petitioner company to see to it that the factum of initial depreciation was disclosed by it there was also a duty on the part of the Income tax Officer concerned to see to that the aggregate of all allowances in respect of depreciation made under section vi of the Act of did not exceed the original cost to the petitioner company The fact remains that such excess depreciation allowance was allowed and two factors apparently were responsible for such granting of excess depreciation the failure or omission on the part of the petitioner company to mention in its return or in the papers filed along with the return or in the course of the assessment proceedings the fact that initial depreciation has been allowed in respect of certain pieces of machinery and to disclose the quantum of that initial depreciation He failed to notice that the aggregate of all allowances in respect of depreciation made under section vi had exceeded the original cost to the assessee of the relevant pieces of machinery It is because of the combined operation of the omission or failure on the part of the petitioner company to disclose these material fats to the Officer in failing to see that the aggregate of all allowances in respect of depreciation under section vi had exceeded the original cost to the petitioner company that the situation came about under which the petitioner company was in fact allowed excess depreciation in the assessment years under consideration It is therefore not possible for us to say that it was by reason of the omission or failure on the part of the petitioner company to disclose fully and truly all material fats necessary for its assessment for the relevant years that the income chargeable to tax escaped assessment for those years It was held that neither the principle of res judicata nor estoppel nor the terms of section vi of the Act prevented prevented the Income tax Officer from determining for himself what the actual cost of the machinery had been and that depreciation had to be calculated for every year and it was open to the Income tax Officer not merely to perform a mathematical operation on the basis of the written down value of the previous year but one of determining the written down value himself It was also observed at page The limit to which the Income tax Officer can go back does not stop at the written down value of the previous year by extends up to the figure of the original cost and the method enjoined by section is not that the Income tax Officer should merely sale down the written down value of the previous year but that he should take into consideration the actual cost determining it for himself if necessary take also into consideration the allowances granted in the past and then make his own computation as to the write down value for the assessment year with which he is concerned Thus it cannot be said that merely because under section some written down value and the depreciation amount have been determined they are a final determination binding for all times to come nor does the determination operate as estoppel or res judicata for the following years It is thus clear that according to <ORG> the method enjoined for the purpose of ascertaining the written down value while granting depreciation allowance was that the Income tax Officer should take into consideration the actual cost determining it for himself if necessary take into consideration the allowance granted in the past and then make his own computation as to the written down value for the assessment year with which he was concerned Hence it is obvious that if the Income tax Officer who passed the assessment orders in the case of the petitioner company at the time of the original assessments for the assessment years to had followed this method which is enjoined upon him and had taken into consideration the actual cost determining it for himself if necessary and had taken also into consideration the allowances granted in the past inclusive of the initial allowance and then had made his own computation as to the write down value for the assessment year with which he was concerned it is obvious that no excess depreciation allowance would have been granted for assessment years to though no doubt true chargeable income escaped assessment in the case of excess depreciation allowance and though there was failure or omission on the part of the assessee namely the petitioner company before us in not disclosing fully and truly all material fats which were necessary for the assessment for those four years still it is not possible for us to say that it was only by reason of such omission or failure on the part of the assessee that the income chargeable to tax had escaped assessment The income escaped assessment also by reason of the fact that the Income tax Officer concerned in the relevant year had not followed the method enjoined upon him for the purposes of calculating depreciation allowance and not taking into consideration all allowances granted in the past in respect of these different pieces of machinery There also there was a question of initial depreciation in respect of certain machinery and the aggregate of depreciation allowances including initial depreciation on the machinery exceeding the ordinal cost but merely because of the failure on the part of the assessee company to mention the amount of initial depreciation it was not held by <ORG> that income had escaped assessment by reason of the omission or failure on the part of the company to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for the assessment In our opinion therefore sine it is not possible to say that income had escaped assessment by reason of the failure or omission on the part of the petitioner company to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for the assessments for the years under consideration the Income tax Officer cannot be said to have reason to believe as had been set out in section a of the Act of Therefore it can be now treated as well settled law that the method of arriving at the amount of depreciation in each assessment year which the Income tax Officer allows in the case of any assessee must be arrived at by him by following the above mentioned method and while following that method it is incumbent upon him to take into consideration the actual cost and also the allowances granted in the past That being the law the conclusion we have reached would necessarily follow and therefore the income chargeable to tax cannot be said to have escaped assessment by reason of the omission or failure on the part of the petitioner company to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for its assessment Because on neither of these two grounds can it be said that by reason of the omission or failure on the part of the assessee to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for the assessment income chargeable to tax had escaped assessment the conditions precedent for the exercise of the jurisdiction under section a cannot be said to exist so far as the present cases are concerned The respondents will pay the costs of the petitioner in each of these Special Civil Applications Rule is made absolute accordingly
