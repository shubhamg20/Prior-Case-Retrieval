Challenge in the present appeal is to the order passed on th September in Special Appeal No of by <ORG> of <ORG> dismissing the appeal filed by the appellants whereby <ORG> has upheld the judgment and order passed by a learned Single Judge of the same <ORG> dismissing the writ petition filed by the appellants thereby upholding the acquisition proceedings in respect of the land of the appellants In order to appreciate the grievance of the appellants facts leading to the filing of the appeal are necessary to be indicated On rd August another notice was issued by the <ORG> under Section of the Act indicating the purpose of acquisition of land for extension of civil lines and planning of housing scheme Appellants on th September filed objections to the acquisition of their land The appellants also submitted their representation from time to time After these notices were issued the appellants filed Writ Petition No of before <ORG> Since the Special Leave Petition was filed against an interim order this Court did not go into the merits of the case and while granting leave by order dated th April set aside the order of <ORG> and held that <ORG> did not have the territorial jurisdiction to entertain the writ petition in respect of a land situated in the State of Rajasthan Thus the proceedings before <ORG> came to an end The appellants filed Writ Petition No of in <ORG> which was withdrawn by them on th March with liberty to file a fresh writ petition On th June the Land Acquisition Officer passed the award and forwarded the same for approval to <ORG> In the meantime the appellants filed Civil Writ Petition No of seeking quashing of Notification dated th February and also notice dated th th February No of One of the objections taken by the respondents before <ORG> was that the writ petition could not be entertained after taking over of the possession of the land and handing over the same to <ORG> and the award having been passed in respect of the said land in accordance with law Ultimately a learned Single Judge of <ORG> of Rajasthan accepting the submissions of the respondents dismissed the writ petition holding that the there was a genuine public purpose behind initiating the acquisition proceedings Being aggrieved the appellants carried the matter in appeal before <ORG> of <ORG> <ORG> agreeing with the view taken by the learned Single Judge dismissed the appeal and held that since the appellants had filed an application under Section of the Land Acquisition Act for enhancement of the compensation they are not entitled to the relief sought for in the writ petition A preliminary objection has been taken by the respondents to the effect that the appeal is liable to be No of Counsel for the appellants however strenuously contended that there was no delay on the part of the appellants in filing the writ petition challenging the acquisition proceedings He submitted that soon after the notice under Section was issued by by the respondents the appellants filed writ petition before <ORG> which stood dismissed pursuant to an order of this Court as noted above Thereafter the appellants filed another writ petition before <ORG> which was withdrawn Within a period of four months thereof i on th July another writ petition bearing No of was filed Counsel also submitted that these acts of the appellants demonstrate that there was no delay on the part of the appellants to seek redressal of their grievance We do not find any substance in the submissions of the counsel for the appellants No doubt the appellants had filed No of a writ petition before <ORG> challenging the acquisition proceedings but the said writ petition was dismissed by this Court on th April holding that <ORG> did not have the territorial jurisdiction to entertain the writ petition Thereafter till the appellants did not challenge the acquisition proceedings and the writ petition was filed by it before <ORG> which had the territorial jurisdiction in the matter and the same was withdrawn which was again filed within the next four months thereof meaning thereby during the interregnum the appellants slept over the matter Be that as it may the award in respect of the land having become final <ORG> is vested with the powers to take possession of the land concerned and therefore there is no reason to disbelieve the claim of <ORG> that the possession had been taken before the filing of the writ petition Simultaneously the appellants filed writ petition before <ORG> after passing of the award This Court has repeatedly held that a writ petition challenging the notification for acquisition of land if filed after the possession having been taken is not maintainable where <NAME> speaking for a Bench consisting of His Lordship and <NAME> held It is thus well settled law that when there is inordinate delay in filing the writ petition and when all steps taken in the acquisition proceedings have become final the Court should be loath to quash the notifications <ORG> has no doubt discretionary powers under Article of the Constitution to quash the notification under Section and declaration under Section When the award was passed and possession was taken the Court should not have exercised its power to quash the award which is a material factor to be taken into consideration before exercising the power under Article The fact that no third party rights were created in the case is hardly a ground for interference <ORG> of <ORG> was not right in interfering with the discretion exercised by the learned Single Judge dismissing the writ petition on the ground of laches Such a belated writ petition therefore was rightly rejected by the learned Single Judge on the ground of gross delay and laches The respondent writ petitioners can be said to have waived their objections to the acquisition on the ground of extinction of No of That finding is obviously incorrect for the simple reason that because of the indolent conduct of the writ petitioners land got acquired award was passed compensation was handed over to various claimants including the landlord Reference applications came to be filed for larger compensation by claimants including writ petitioners themselves Thus right to get more compensation got vested in diverse claimants by passing of the award as well as vested right was created in favour of <ORG> by virtue of the vesting of the land in <ORG> for being handed over to the <ORG> The writ petition came to be filed after all these events had taken place following the decision of this Court in the case of <ORG> supra it was held When the award was passed and possession was taken the Court should not have exercised its power to quash the award which is a material factor to be taken into consideration before exercising the power under Article The fact that no third party rights were created in the case is hardly a ground for interference <ORG> of <ORG> was not right in interfering with the discretion exercised by the learned Single Judge dismissing the writ petition on the ground of laches
