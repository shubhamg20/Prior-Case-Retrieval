In this reference under Section of the Income tax Act at the instance of the Commissioner of Income tax the following two questions have been referred to this court for the assessment year Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the assessee can claim as deduction the provision for payment of leave salary in the year under consideration At the suggestion of the learned advocates we have reframed the first question as follows to bring out the real controversy Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of this case the additional expenditure incurred by reason of exchange fluctuation in respect of the payment of the instalments of loan in Japanese yen obtained for the purchase of machinery on deferred payment basis was capital or revenue expenditure The facts relating to the first question are stated hereafter The claim of the assessee for the deduction of the said amount under Section A of the Act has been negatived by the Income tax Officer on the ground that the said loss was capital and not revenue in nature because the loss arose in making instalment payments of the purchase price of the machineries which were capital assets of the assessee There is no dispute that the loss relates to capital in the sense that in respect of certain loans which were to be repaid by the assessee they were incurred in acquiring capital assets and the loss arose The decision in <ORG> has no application as it is a case of loss on devaluation In that case the <ORG> has taken the view that foreign loans were obtained by the assessee in the course of business which were ultimately utilised for the purchase of plant and machinery It is his contention that in the instant case whatever extra payment in terms of rupees was made by the assessee must be taken to be an unavoidable expenditure in connection with the loan He has relied on various decisions in support of his contention A number of cases have been cited before us but it seems to us that the answer to the question depends on whether the act of keeping the money i for capital purposes after obtaining the sanction of <ORG> was part of or a trading transaction There is no doubt that the amount of was a revenue receipt in the assessee business of commission agency Instead of repatriating it immediately the assessee obtained the sanction of <ORG> to utilise the commission in its business of manufacture of locomotive boilers and locomotives for buying capital goods In our view it was not a trading transaction in the business of manufacture of locomotive boilers and locomotives it was clearly a transaction of accumulating dollars to pay for capital goods the first step in the acquisition of capital goods If the assessee had repatriated and then after obtaining the sanction of <ORG> remitted to the A Mr <NAME> does not contest that any profit made on devaluation would have been a capital profit But in our opinion the fact that the assessee kept the money there does not make any difference especially as we have pointed out when it was a new transaction which the assessee entered into the transaction being the first step in the acquisition of capital goods The law may therefore now be taken to be well settled that where profit or loss arises to an assessee on account of appreciation or depreciation in the value of foreign currency held by it on conversion into another currency such profit or loss would ordinarily be trading profit or loss if the foreign currency is held by the assessee on revenue account or as a trading asset or as part of circulating capital embarked in the business But if on the other hand the foreign currency is held as a capital asset or as fixed capital such profit or loss would be of capital nature If these two amounts were employed in the business in West Pakistan and formed part of the circulating capital of that business the loss of Rs resulting to the assessee on the remittance of those two amounts to India on account of alteration in the rate of exchange would be a trading loss but if instead these two amounts were held on capital account and were part of fixed capital the loss would plainly be a capital loss The question whether the loss suffered by the assessee was a trading loss or a capital loss cannot therefore be answered unless it is first determined whether these two amounts were held by the assessee on capital account or on revenue account or to put it differently as part of fixed capital or of circulating capital Mr <NAME> for the assessee has contended in the course of his submissions that a loss has to be considered in a different way from a gain in computing business profits There may be cases where a loss dehors the business is allowed as a business loss whereas a gain arising in similar circumstances will never be a business gain In our view this distinction again is of little significance as the gain or the loss as the case may be has to be connected with the business before the same can enter into the computation of profits On a scrutiny of the facts of the instant case it appears to us that as a result of the devaluation which befell the assessee it became immediately liable to an extra liability in terms of its rupee assets for repayment of its debts This extra expenditure deemed or otherwise or this loss is inextricably connected with the assessee indebtedness and did not arise dehors the indebtedness nor was it incurred for the purposes of the loan and it was as if from the date of the devaluation the dues from the assessee to its creditors in rupees were increased We are unable to accept the contentions of Mr <NAME> that the extra amount which the assessee had to provide for as a result of the devaluation is to be considered as extra expenditure to be incurred for meeting the debt just as postal expenses or bank charges or this extra expenditure which would result in a business loss of a revenue nature In that case the assessee entered into an agreement on December with an Italian company for the purchase of machinery at the total value working out to Rs The agreement further provided that the Italian company should draw bills of exchange on the assessee which were to be accepted by the assessee and payments of which were to be guaranteed by <ORG> The agreement also provided for payment in terms of British sterling calculated at the prevalent exchange rate between sterling and the dollar and if there should be variation in the exchange rate the same should be separately settled with credit notes in rupees or in lire in favour respectively of the Italian company or the assessee as the case may be Similarly the assessee had to pay a larger amount on account of fluctuations in exchange rate in respect of other instalments in On the aforesaid facts <ORG> held that as the price fixed under the agreement was only a tentative price which had to be discharged at the prevailing rates of exchange at the time of the respective payments the payments related only to the purchase price of the machinery and the difference was on capital account and not allowable as business expenditure Act with effect from April would not in any way affect the point in issue which has to be considered in the light of the actual nature of the payment that had to be made and in the light of the provisions in force But if on the other hand the foreign currency is held as a capital asset or as fixed capital such profit or loss would be of capital nature The learned advocate for the assessee also emphasised that there <ORG> was dealing essentially with the assessee own money Therefore according to him <ORG> had no occasion to advert to this aspect of the matter where in a case the assessee was dealing with borrowed money Then this court considered the scope of Section A of the Act At page the court referred to the object of the Finance Bill which introduced Section A Bill which introduced Section A Clause of the Notes on Clauses sought to explain the purpose of such insertion which reads as follows ITR St Clause seeks to insert a new Section A in the Income tax Act The proposed Section A in substance secures that where an assessee had acquired any capital asset from a country outside India for the purposes of his business or profession on deferred payment terms or against a foreign loan before the date of devaluation of the rupee the additional rupee liability incurred by him in meeting the instalments of the cost of the asset or of the foreign loan as the case may be falling due for payment after the date of devaluation will be allowed to be added to the original actual cost of the asset for the purpose of calculating the allowance on account of depreciation in computing the profits for the assessment year and subsequent assessment years Similar increase in the original actual cost will be allowed to be made in respect of the capital assets acquired by the assessee to be used in scientific research related to the class of business carried on by him or patent rights or copyrights acquired from abroad or any capital asset acquired by a company for the purpose of promoting family planning amongst its employees Further in computing the capital gains arising to the assessee on the sale or transfer of a capital asset acquired by him from abroad on deferred payment terms or against a foreign loan the additional rupee liability incurred by him in repaying the instalments of the cost or the foreign loan as the case may be after the date of devaluation of the rupee will be added to the original actual cost of the asset The proposed section also secures that where there is a decrease in the rupee liability of the assessee in respect of assets acquired by him from abroad due to a change in the exchange value of the rupee the original actual cost of the asset will be correspondingly reduced The additional rupee liability incurred on imported capital assets or as the case may be any decrease in such liability in the circumstances stated in the earlier paragraph will not however be taken into account in computing the actual cost of the asset for the purpose of deduction on account of development rebate Therefore any appreciation or depreciation in value of assets as a result of devaluation in profit or loss arising therefrom must be governed by the special provisions of Section A A special provision has been made and this is the only provision to guide the matter Before we deal with that aspect of the matter we must refer to Section which uses a non obstante clause of STC That apart even if Article continues the pre Constitution laws of taxation that provision is expressly made subject to the other provisions of the Constitution The expression subject to conveys the idea of a provision yielding place to another provision or other provisions to which it is made subject Further Article opens out with a non obstante clause While Article is subject to Article Article operates in its own sphere in spite of Article The result is that Article overrides Article that is to say notwithstanding the fact that a pre Constitution taxation law continues in force under Article the <ORG> and the State Governments can enter into an agreement in terms of Article in respect of Part States depriving the State law of its efficacy In one view Article excludes the operation of Article and in the other view an agreement in terms of Article overrides Article In either view the result is the same namely that at any rate during the period covered by the agreement the States ceased to have any power to impose the tax in respect of works contracts It states in essence that in spite of what is contained previously this clause would be operative Another significant fact has to be borne in mind that Sub section of Section A deals with the expression acquisition which deals with the situation where there is a change in the valuation of foreign currency after acquisition But in the case of development rebate it has to be emphasised that acquisition is not relevant on the material date but the date of installation is the most material date At page the court observed as follows In the instant case before us the contract stipulated repayment in dollars Therefore the actual cost of the assessee must be computed on the dollar value Therefore anything which went into that repayment that is to say any cost which actually went in repaying the debt must be in our opinion on the principle of computation of the actual cost which irrespective of Section A would be entitled to development rebate under Section A and inasmuch as Sub section of Section A only excludes the portion of Sub section of Section A in our opinion this position would not be inadmissible that the assessee would be entitled to obtain the development rebate In the instant case we are concerned with the question whether Section was at all meant for dealing with the case where there is no question of installation involved but only acquisition was the relevant fact CIT ITR and at page observed as follows In so far as the decision took the view that in respect of all devaluation cases irrespective of whether the stipulated payment in the matter of foreign currency should be made under Section A alone with great respect we are unable to agree and we prefer to adhere to the former view of <ORG> and the other view of <ORG> as mentioned hereinbefore On behalf of the assessee it was contended that Section A has been introduced to meet with the situation of computing depreciation year after year where the price in terms of Indian rupee fluctuates on account of change in the rate of exchange But since no such situation arises in the cases of development rebate which is granted once and for all the said provision has not been made applicable to the computation of development rebate The development rebate continues to be computed on the basis of the provisions of Section as before It was linked with the actual cost of the machinery or plant to the assessee Therefore on the relevant date when the contract was entered into it was entered into with the direction to pay back in dollars and whatever was necessary to pay back must be treated as actual cost to the assessee Having regard to the principles laid down by the aforesaid decisions we are unable to accept the contention of Mr <NAME> There is no qualitative difference in the additional expenditure incurred due to the devaluation or fluctuation in the rate of exchange Although in that case the court was concerned with a case of devaluation the principles laid down therein will equally apply to a case like this where the additional liability arises because of fluctuation in the rate of exchange As laid down in <ORG> this extra expenditure deemed or otherwise or this loss is inextricably connected with the assessee indebtedness and did not arise dehors the indebtedness nor was it incurred for the purpose of the loan and it was as if from the date of the devaluation the dues from the the assessee to its creditors in rupees were increased This case has no application to the facts of this case as the extra expenditure was not incurred to obtain the loan It is at the point of repayment of the loan that the assessee has to provide an extra amount in rupees by reason of the fluctuation in the rate of exchange The decision relied on by Mr <NAME> in the case of <ORG> also does not assist him There the assessee had taken a loan from <ORG> of Washington for making payment in the A of the price of capital plant and machinery purchased for its project One of the questions was whether the increase in liability of the assessee for repayment of loan due to devaluation was allowable deduction in computing the business income of the assessee There the court considered various decisions including the decision in the case of <ORG> Thus whether there is devaluation or whether there is fluctuation in the rate of exchange the fact remains that the exchange rate goes against the assessee resulting in increase in the liability and there cannot be any difference in principle in deciding the question In <ORG> the alternative argument of the assessee that development rebate should have been allowed on the increased liability arising out of devaluation attributable to plant and machinery was accepted Even the observation of this court in that context also does not support the contention of Mr <NAME> The principle which has been laid down in <ORG> by this court is that if the contract stipulates repayment in foreign currency the actual cost of the asset must be computed on the value of the foreign currency Anything which went into the repayment was part of the actual cost of the capital asset Thus in the instant case also the extra expenditure incurred by the assessee would be towards the cost of plant and machinery and accordingly it will be on capital account We therefore answer the first question by saying that the additional expenditure incurred by reason of exchange fluctuation was capital expenditure Now we shall take up the second question The facts relating to the second question are stated hereunder According to the leave rules of the assessee one of the leaves to which the employees of the assessee are entitled is known as privilege leave Rule of the said leave rules further provides the method for encashment of leave by different categories of employees Rule A further provides that without prejudice to the aforesaid general provisions for encashment of leave the management shall have the right at its sole discretion to permit encashment of any number of days of accumulated privilege leave not exceeding days in cases like marriage sickness accident or other special circumstances beyond reasonable control of the person concerned like refusal of leave by the management etc It is also an admitted position that prior to the year under consideration the assessee was claiming the deduction in the matter of payment on account of privilege leave when the same was encashed on retirement or on the termination of the services of the employees in a particular year Though this was the practice in the past the assessee in the accounts for the year made a provision in respect of its accrued liability for payment of accumulated leave earned by the employee amounting to Rs The claim of the assessee for the deduction of the said amount had been negatived by the Income tax Officer on the ground that the liability is a contingent liability The Tribunal upheld the contention of the assessee and inter alia observed as follows No doubt in the past the assessee was claiming the deduction only to the extent to which the said privilege leave was encashed by an employee on retirement or on termination of his service yet that is not conclusive on the subject Once the privilege leave is earned by an employee it gets credited to his account It has been contended by Mr <NAME> with reference to the leave rules that the liability accrues to the assessee for payment of leave wages as soon as leave under the rules has become due to the employees He has particularly referred to the following rules in support of his contention Privilege leave i Every permanent employee shall be entitled to privilege leave at the rate of thirty days for every completed period of twelve months ii Privilege leave will be credited to the account of each individual at the end of each financial year of the company or calendar year as may be applicable hereinafter referred to as the year iii Privilege leave will accumulate up to days only The management shall have the right at its sole discretion to permit encashment of any number of days of accumulated privilege leave not exceeding days Mr <NAME> has also drawn our attention to Rule which is in the following terms For the purpose of leave encashment the leave record will be completed immediately after the end of every calendar year or financial year of the company and the benefit of unavailed or accumulated leave if any shall be given as per these Rules in the succeeding calendar year or financial year as the case may be He has also submitted that out of the provision made leave salary would be paid to the employees This will depend on whether he actually avails himself of the leave or not If leave is due to a person he has the option either to accumulate the leave or he may avail of the leave If he avails of the leave he would be entitled to the leave salary If he does not he will be entitled to the benefit of encashment of the leave He has relied on several decisions in support of his contention being the amount set apart as a reserve fund in its balance sheet for the payments it may have to make to its workers in the next year on account of holiday wages under Section of the Factories Act It was held that the liability that rests on the employer to pay a worker wages in accordance with Section for leave period remains a contingent liability which the employer may or may not be called upon to discharge That being so any sum set apart by an employer in any year for meeting the contingency of some of his workers going on leave the next year cannot be regarded as a permissible expenditure under Section xv of the Indian Income tax Act The liability under Section of the Factories Act to pay holiday wages depends on the arising of circumstances specified therein and since they may or may not arise the liability is only a contingent and uncertain liability which may or may not have to be discharged of ITR It should be clear from what I have stated above that such statutory liability for holiday wages as the Factories Act creates is only a contingent liability which may or may not have to be discharged and secondly the measure of that liability can never be known in advance It cannot be so known because it cannot be known in advance how many employees will avail themselves of how many holidays and when and necessarily at what rate holiday wages would be payable In those circumstances it is perfectly clear that not only is the amount claimed not allowable as an item of expenditure because in fact no expenditure had been incurred and not a pica had gone out of the funds of the company but also that the amount does not even represent a certain liability which will have to be discharged in any event It may be that although a particular amount is not actually expended during the currency of a particular accounting year the assessee will still be entitled to a deduction if a certain liability for its payment has arisen so that it may be said that the expenditure is as good as made The amount claimed in the present case is certainly not even of that character and as I have already pointed out it is not an amount which was actually spent for payments it may have to make to its workers in the next year on account of holiday wages under Section of the Factories Act and claimed deduction in respect of that amount on the footing that it had incurred a liability to pay leave wages to its employees in the year of account It is true that this court as well as the Madhya Pradesh and Bombay High Courts considered the scope of the provisions of the Factories Act regarding the payment of holiday wages and upon the consideration of the relevant provisions the courts held that the liability was contingent The principles which have been laid down in those cases in our opinion would equally apply to the facts of this case Leave wages are payable only when a person goes on leave and during the period of leave the wages paid to him are known as leave wages It cannot be ascertained with any certainty whether in a particular year the employees would go on leave or the leave would be granted to them The liability will only arise when a person goes on leave and it is only for that particular month or months he is on leave the leave wages are payable Similarly in the case of wages which are paid during the leave period the employee becomes entitled to such leave wages only when he goes on leave There the assessees were partners of a firm which was engaged in the business of processing and exporting cashew kernels For the assessment year relevant to the valuation date December the assessees claimed deduction in respect of the amounts payable by the firm by way of leave with wages in calculating their interest in the firm for purposes of wealth tax The <ORG> found that subsequent to the decision of <ORG> in <ORG> <ORG> a practice came to be crystallised in the cashew industry in Kerala making it obligatory for the management to pay the workers leave with wages contemplated under Section of the Factories Act irrespective of the number of days they worked On a reference <ORG> held that the amounts in question did not relate to a contingent or future liability but to an existing liability liability which had already been incurred as a result of the practice which had as found by the <ORG> come to be crystallised in the cashew industry following an earlier decision of the court Hence these were amounts in the nature of debts which could be taken into account for computation under the Wealth tax Act It is therefore clear that there is no obligation on the employer to pay the leave wages irrespective of the number of days worked by the employee as in the Kerala case <ORG> in that case was concerned inter alia with the question whether it is legitimate in a scheme of gratuity to estimate the liability on actuarial valuation and deduct such estimated liability in the profit and loss account while working out the net profit <ORG> held that if the liability is properly ascertainable and if it is possible to arrive at its discounted present value even if the liability is a contingent liability it can be taken into account The rate of leave salary will depend on the salary a person draws at the time when he goes on leave and not when the leave is accumulated He will only be entitled to encash such accumulated leave when he retires or his services are terminated or determined The contention of Mr <NAME> has no substance and must fail The second question is therefore answered in the negative and in favour of the <ORG>
