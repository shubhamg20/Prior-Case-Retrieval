HEADNOTE Entry of the Union List I in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution confers power for the regulation of mines and mineral development to the extent to which such regulation and development under the control of the union is declared by <ORG> by law to be expedient in the public interest Entry of List II of the Constitution gives power for regulation of mines and mineral development to the <ORG>s subject to entry of List I The corresponding entry under the Government of India Act was entry of List Il Rule of the Mineral Concession Rules made under the Act which came into force on October gave power to the <ORG> Government to frame rules for the regulation and development of minor minerals as defined in the Rules In Act of the provisions relating to regulation of mines in to were by made inapplicable to minor minerals as defined in the Act The appellant purchased in a lease for quarrying minor minerals as defined in Act of from a vendor who had taken the original lease from the then landlords in Rule of the said Bihar Rules as originally framed provided for realisation of dead rent royalty and surface rent in respect of leases granted or renewed But in December it was amended by the addition of a second sub rule according to which the provisions as to dead rent etc would also apply to leases granted or renewed prior to the date of the commencement of the Act and subsisting on such date The appellant thereupon filed a writ petition in <ORG> Dissatisfied with the judgment of that court the appellant came to this Court It was contended on behalf of the appellant i that the subject of regulation of mines and mineral development came within the exclusive jurisdiction of <ORG> as a result of the passing of Act of with the result that the <ORG> Legislature was left with no power to pass the second proviso to and the said proviso was therefore ultra vires ii that being without legislative support could not touch a lease granted in On behalf of the respondent <ORG> it was urged that a the nd proviso to of the Reforms Act fell not under entry but under entry of List II which dealt with land and land tenures Act of did not result in control of the union as contemplated by entry in List I and therefore the <ORG> jurisdiction under entry List II was not ousted modification of leases was not covered by of the said Act and since <ORG> was silent on that subject the field remained open for legislation by the <ORG> Once this declaration is made and the extent laid down the subject of the legislation to the extent laid down becomes an exclusive subject for legislation by <ORG> The declaration contemplated by entry is contained in of Act of and the <ORG> is given control as to regulation of mines and mineral development to the extent provided in the Act Thus what is left within the competence of <ORG> Government has to be worked out from the terms of the Act itself The Act deals with minor minerals separately from other minerals In respect of minor minerals it provides in that ss to do not apply to prospecting licences and mining leases It goes on to state in that the <ORG> Government may by notification make rules for regulating the grant of prospecting licences and mining leases in respect of minor minerals and for purposes connected therewith and in that till such rules Therefore the whole subject of legislation was covered in respect of minor minerals by Whether rules under that section were made or not the topic was covered by <ORG>ary legislation and to that extent the powers of the <ORG> Legislature were wanting It must accordingly be held that by the declaration in and by the enactment of the whole of the field relating to minor minerals came within the jurisdiction of <ORG> and no scope was left for the enactment of the second proviso to of the Land Reforms Act The power of <ORG> to modify existing mining leases was confined under of the Act to leases granted before October It could not derive sustenance from the nd proviso to of the Reforms Act as that proviso was not validly enacted There was also no other legislative support since of the Act of did not contemplate alteration of terms of leases already in existence before that Act was passed iii The contentions raised on behalf of the <ORG> must be rejected a The abolition of the rights of intermediaries in the mines and vesting of these rights as lessors in the <ORG> Government was a topic connected with land and land tenures But after the mining leases stood between the <ORG> Government and the leases any attempt to regulate those mining leases will fall not in entry but in entry The pith and substance of the amendment to of the Reforms Act falls within entry although it incidentally touches land The entire legislative field relating to minor minerals having been withdrawn from the State legislature it could not be said that because did not deal with modification of leases the State was free to legislate in this field Appeals from the judgments and orders dated November December and December of <ORG> in Nos These four appeals have been brought against a common judgment November of <ORG> and arise out of four petitions under Art The facts of all the four cases are similar and the same points arise for determination He sold his rights title and interest by a registered sale deed on September to the present appellant Subsisting leases of mines and minerals Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act where immediately before the date of vesting of the estate or tenure there is a subsisting lease of mines or minerals comprised in the estate or tenure or any part thereof the whole or that part of the estate or tenure comprised in such lease shall with effect from the date of vesting be deemed to have been mediaries the State of Bihar as the new lessor recognised the lease for the quarrying of stones for the remaining period and the Deputy Commissioner <NAME> asked for the rent from the date of vesting to April at the rate of Rs On December the appellants received a letter which gives the gist of the facts on which the present controversy starts and the relevant part may be quoted here Government have been pleased to amend the section of Bihar Land Reforms Act and according to which the terms and conditions in regard to leases for minor minerals stand statutorily substituted by the corresponding terms and conditions by the Bihar Minor Mineral Concession Rules The terms and conditions of the said lease by <ORG> shall mutatis mutandis be the same as the terms and conditions of the subsisting condition that if in the opinion of <ORG> the holder of the lease had not before the date of the commencement of this Act done any prospecting or development work <ORG> shall be entitled at any time before the expiry of one year from the said date to determine the lease by giving three months notice in writing Provided that nothing in this sub section shall be deemed to prevent any modifications being made in the terms and conditions of the said lease in accordance with the provisions of any Central Act for the time being in force regulating the modification of existing mining leases a dead rent shall be charged at the rates specified in Schedule royalty shall be charged at the rates specified in Schedule II and surface rent shall be charged at the rates specified by the <ORG> a in sub section the following second proviso shall be added namely Provided further that the terms and conditions of the said lease in regard to minor minerals as defined in the Mines and Minerals Regulation and Development Act Act LXVII of shall in so far as they are inconsistent with the rules made by <ORG> under section of that Act stand substituted by the corresponding terms and conditions prescribed by those rules and if further ascertainment and settlement of the terms will become necessary then necessary proceedings for that purpose shall be undertaken by the Collector and after sub LISup Cl On and from the date of commencement of these rules the provisions of sub rule shall also apply to leases granted or renewed prior to the date of such commencement and subsisting on such date Under the Government of India Act the subject of Mines and Minerals was covered by Entry of the Federal Legislative List I and entry No of the Provincial Legislative List II of the th Schedule These entries read as follows Entry Regulation of mines and oil fields and mineral developments to which such regulation and development under a <ORG> control is declared by <ORG> law to be expedient in the public interest When the Indian Independence Act was passed the word federal where it occurs for the first time in entry and in entry was changed to dominion The entries are practically repeated in the present Constitution and may be read immediately here Entry of List <ORG> List reads Regulation of mines and mineral development to the extent to which such regulation and development under the control of the <ORG> is declared by <ORG> by law to be expedient in the public interest It received the assent of the Governor General on September In of that Act is to be found the declaration contemplated by entries and th Schedule of the Government of India Act It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that <ORG> should take under its control the regulation of mines and oil fields and the development of minerals to the extent hereinafter provided Section of the Act of contained definitions There were definitions of mine and minerals The former meant an excavation for the purpose of searching for or obtaining minerals and included an oil well and the latter included natural gas and petroleum Section provided that no mining lease would be granted after the commencement of that Act otherwise than in accordance with the rules made under that Act and that a mining lease granted contrary to the provisions would be void and of no effect Section empowered <ORG> by notification to make rules for regulating the grant of mining leases or for prohibiting the grant of such leases in respect of any mineral or in any area In particular the rules could provide for the manner in which the minerals or areas in respect of which and the persons by whom applications for mining leases could be made and the fees payable the terms on which and the conditions subject to which mining leases might be granted the areas and the period for which any mining lease might be granted and the maximum and minimum rent payable by a lessee whether the mine was worked or not Under <ORG> had power to make rules as respect mineral development The Central Government may by notification in the official <ORG> make rules for the purpose of modifying or altering the terms and conditions of any mining lease granted prior to the commencement of this Act so as to bring such lease into conformity with the rules made under sections and Provided that any rules so made which provide for the matters mentioned in clause of sub section shall not come into force until they have been approved either with or without modification by <ORG> The rules made under sub section shall provide a for giving previous notice of the modification or alteration proposed to be made thereunder to the lessee and when the lessor is not <ORG> also to the lessor and for affording them an opportunity of showing cause against the proposal Section provided that <ORG> might by notification direct that any power exercisable under that Act might be exercised subject to such conditions if any as might be specified by such officer or authority or might be specified in the direction In furtherance of the powers conferred <ORG> framed the Mineral Concession Rules and they came into force on the twenty fifth day of October These rules for the first time defined minor minerals and after amendments from time to time the term meant ii minor mineral means building stone boulder shingle gravel Chalcedony pebbles used for ball mill purposes only limeshell kankar and limestone used for lime burning murrum brick earth Fuller earth Bentonite ordinary clay ordinary sand used for non industrial purposes road metal reh matti slate and shale when used for building material These rules shall not apply to minor minerals the extraction of which shall be regulated by such rules as <ORG> may prescribe Although some of the Provinces now <ORG> made Minor Mineral Concession Rules it is admitted that Bihar Government did not frame any such rules We now come to the year It came into force from December All references to minerals other than oil were removed with the result that it became legislation exclusively relating to oil and gas We are primarily concerned with this Act in these appeals The Act of came into force on st June and extended to the whole of India It contained the following declaration in It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that the <ORG> should take under the control the regulation of mines and the development of minerals to the extent hereinafter provided Minor minerals were defined to mean building stones gravel ordinary clay ordinary sand other than sand used for prescribed purposes and any other mineral which <ORG> may by notification in <ORG> declare to be a minor mineral Act of contained sections which were separated by general headings showing the topics dealt with The first group of sections contained general restrictions on undertaking prospecting and mining operations Prospecting or mining operations to be under license or lease No person shall undertake any prospecting or mining operations in any area except under and in accordance with the terms and conditions of a prospecting licence or as the case may be a mining lease granted under this Act and the rules made thereunder Provided that nothing in this sub section shall affect any prospecting or mining operations undertaken in any area in accordance with the terms and conditions of a prospecting licence or mining lease granted before the commencement of this Act which is in force at such commencement Section lays down restrictions on the grant of prospecting licences or mining leases the maximum area for which a prospecting license or mining lease may be granted and section the periods for which prospecting licences may be granted or renewed and section the periods for which mining leases may be granted or renewed Section fixes the royalties in respect of mining leases Then follows another group of sections which lays down the procedure for obtaining prospecting licences or mining leases in respect of land in which the minerals vest in the <ORG> Section gives power to the Central <ORG> to make rules in respect of minerals Section however excludes the application of sections to minor minerals It reads The provisions of sections to inclusive shall not apply to prospecting licences and mining leases in respect of minor minerals Section gives power to the State Governments to make rules in respect of minor minerals The State Government may by notification in the official <ORG> make rules Until rules are made under sub section any rules made by a State Government regulating the grant of prospecting licences and mining leases respect of minor minerals which are in force immediately before the commencement of this Act shall continue in force Section gives power to modify mining leases granted before th October All mining leases granted before the th day of October shall as soon as may be after the commencement of this Act be brought into conformity with the provisions of this Act and the rules made under sections and Provided that if the Central Government is of opinion that in the interests of minerals development it is expedient so to do it may for reasons to be recorded permit any person to hold one or more such mining leases covering in any one State a total area in excess of that specified in clause of section or for a period exceeding that specified in sub section of section The Central Government may by notification in the official <ORG> make rules for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of sub section and in particular such rules shall provide a for giving previous notice of the modification or alteration proposed to be made in any existing mining lease to the lessee and where the lessor is not <ORG> also to the lessor and for affording him an opportunity of showing cause against the proposal Section stands by itself as a group and contains special powers of <ORG> to undertake prospecting or minning operations in certain cases Section lays down that prospecting licences or mining leases granted renewed or acquired in contravention of the provisions of the Act shall be void and of no effect and section that the provisions apply to prospecting licences or mining leases whether granted before or after the Act It may be pointed out here that the rules made under do not apply to minor minerals in view of the provisions of The argument of the appellant is that apart from the provisions of the nd proviso to added to the Land Reforms Act in by Act IV of and second sub rule added to rule of the Bihar Minor Mineral Concession Rules there is no power to modify the terms With regard to <ORG> it is contended that the scheme of the relevant entries in the Union and State List is that to the extent to which regulation of mines and mineral development is declared by <ORG> by law to be expedient in the public interest the subject of legislation is withdrawn from the jurisdiction of <ORG> and therefore Act of leaves no legislative field to <ORG> to enact Act of amending the Land Reforms Act As regards Rule it is contended that the rule making power of its own force cannot reach mining leases granted in and that this could only be done by a competent legislature These are the two matters which need decision That the Bihar Rules in so far as they make demands of rent and royalty on the existing leases which were executed prior to their coming into force are beyond the power to make rules in respect of minor minerals under of Act of that itself is unconstitutional and void because it delegates legislative power to the rule making authority and it is excessive delegation and that the amendment of Bihar Land Reforms Act is void because it affects the fundamental rights of the appellants guaranteed under Articles and of the Constitution As the amendment was made after Act of we have to consider the position in relation to it Entry of the Union List speaks both of regulation of mines and minerals development and entry is subject to entry Once this declaration is made and the extent laid down the subject of legislation to the extent laid down becomes an exclusive subject for legislation by <ORG> Any legislation by the <ORG> after such declaration and trenching upon the field disclosed in the declaration must necessarily be unconstitutional because that field is abstracted from the legislative competence of the <ORG> Legislature This proposition is also self evident that no attempt was rightly made to contradict it The only dispute therefore can be to what extent the declaration by <ORG> leaves any scope for legislation by the <ORG> Legislature If the impugned legislation falls within the ambit of such scope it will be valid if outside it then it must be declared invalid We have thus not to look outside Act of to determine what is left within the competence of <ORG> but have to work it out from the terms of that Act In this connection we may notice what was decided in the two cases of this Court In the Hingir Rampur case a question had arisen whether the Act of so completely covered the fields of conservation and development of minerals as to leave no room for <ORG> legislation However considering further whether a declaration made by a <ORG> law could be regarded as a declaration by <ORG> for the purpose of entry it was held that it could not and there was thus a lacuna which the Adaptation of Therefore it was held that there was room for legislation by <ORG> After the provisions came into force a demand was made for payment of fees due from July to March and the demand was challenged It was held on appeal that since Act of contained the requisite declaration by <ORG> under entry and that Act covered the same field as the Act of in regard to mines and mineral development the ruling in Hingir Rampur case applied and as ss and of the Act of were very wide ruled out legislation by <ORG> Where a superior legislature evinced an intention to cover the whole field the enactments of the other legislature whether passed before or after must be held to be overborne As covered the entire field there was no scope for the argument that till rules were framed under that section room was available These two cases bind us and apply here The other side must of course show that the matter is already covered and there is no room for legislation We have already analysed Act of The Act takes over the control of regulation of mines and development of minerals to the <ORG> of course to the extent provided It deals with minor minerals separately from the other minerals In respect of minor minerals it provides in that ss of the Act do not apply to prospecting licences and mining leases It goes on to state in that the <ORG> Government may by notification in the official <ORG> make rules for regulating the grant of prospecting licences and mining leases in respect of minor minerals and for purposes connected therewith and that until rules are made any rules made by the <ORG> Government regulating the grant of prospecting licences and mining lease in respect of minor minerals which were in force immediately before the commencement of the Act would continue in force It follows that the subject of legislation is covered in respect of minor minerals by the express words of <ORG> has undertaken legislation and laid down that regulation of the grant of prospecting licences and mining leases in respect of minor minerals and for purposes connected therewith must be by rules made by <ORG> Whether the rules are made or not the topic is covered by <ORG>ary legislation and to that extent the powers of <ORG> are wanting Therefore there is no room for <ORG> legislation Mr <NAME> argued that the topic of legislation concerns land and therefore falls under entry of the State List and he drew our attention to other provisions on the subject of mines in the Land Reforms Act as originally passed The abolition of the rights of intermediaries in the mines and vesting these rights as lessors in <ORG> was a topic connected with land and land tenures But after the mining leases stood between <ORG> and the lessees any attempt to regulate those mining leases will fall not in entry but in entry even though the regulation incidentally touches land The pith and substance of the amendment to of the Reforms Act falls within entry although it incidentally touches land and not vice versa In fact it establishes that the <ORG> is exercising the control In view of the two rulings of this <ORG> referred to earlier we must hold that by enacting of Act of the <ORG> has taken all the power to itself and authorised <ORG> to make rules for the regulation of leases By the declaration and the enactment of the whole of the field relating to minor minerals came within the jurisdiction of <ORG> and no scope was left for the enactment of the second proviso to in the Land Reforms Act This leaves for consideration the second sub rule added to Rule in December by <ORG> The second sub rule made applicable those provisions to all leases subsisting on the date of the promulgation of the rules We have already held that the whole of the legislative field was covered by the <ORG>ary declaration read with provisions of Act of particularly We have also held that entry of List II was to that extent cut down by entry of List I The whole of the topic of minor minerals became a <ORG> subject The <ORG> <ORG> allowed rules to be made but that did not recreate a scope for legislation at the State level The place of such a law could not be taken by legislation by <ORG> as it purported to do by enacting the second Proviso to of the Land Reforms Act Whether was intended to apply to minor minerals as well or any part of it applies to minor minerals are questions we cannot consider in view of the clear declaration in of Act of that the provisions of ss inclusive do not apply Therefore there does not exist any prohibition such as is to be found in Proviso in respect of minor minerals Although applies to minor minerals it only permits modification of mining leases granted before October In regard to leases of minor minerals executed between this date and December when Rule was enacted there is no provision of law which enables the terms of existing leases to be altered Therefore if <ORG> had not said anything on the subject the field was open to <ORG> We have also held that vested rights could only be taken away by law made by a competent legislature The existing provision related to regulation of leases and matters connected therewith to be granted in future and not for alteration of the terms of leases which were in existence before Act of It could not derive sustenance from the second Proviso to of the Land Reforms Act since that proviso was not validly enacted A mandamus shall issue restraining <ORG> from enforcing the provisions of the second Proviso to added by Bihar and Reforms Amendment Act Bihar Act of and the second sub rule of Rule added by a notification on December to the Bihar Mineral Concession Rules
