Explanation II to section Whether ultra vires the Constitution Threat to use coercive machinery of Act for realising tax whether infringement of fundamental rights under art ii A threat by the <ORG> to realize tax from the assesses without the authority of law by using the coercive machinery of the impugned Act is a sufficient infringement of his fundamental right under art and gives him a right to seek relief under art The impugned Act requiring the assesses to deposit the whole of the tax before he can get the relief provided by it cannot be said to provide an adequate alternative remedy The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> is an appeal by leave from a judgment of <ORG> at Nagpur dated the th of April dismissing a petition under article of the Constitution of India filed by the appellant questioning the vires of certain provisions of the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act The appellant represents a concern <ORG> a company registered under the Indian Companies Act having its head office at Bombay and several branches in For the quarter ending on the stof March the appellant declined to pay the tax in respect of the purchases made during that quarter realizing that it could not be made legally liable for the payment of this tax in the State of Madhya Pradesh the transactions done or effected in Madhya Pradesh not being sales within that State was heard by a Division Bench of <ORG> and it was held that Explanation II to section of the Act was not enforceable because under the Constitution sales tax could only be collected in the State where the goods were delivered for consumption It was further held that Explanation as amended by the Berar Act XVI of was not validly enacted because it made drastic changes in the rules of the Sale of Goods Act It was observed that the mere reduction of the goods in a State is not enough to make the tax payable unless the goods are appropriated to a particular contract and that to impose the tax at that stage would be tantamount to charging an excise duty and not a tax on the sale of goods the petition made to it under article of the Constitution on the ground that a mandamus issues only to compel an authority to do or abstain from doing some act that it is seldom anticipatory and certainly never issues where the action of the authority is dependant on some action of the petitioner and that in the present case the petitioner had not even made his return and no demand for the tax could be made from him In this appeal it was argued by <NAME> learned counsel for the appellant that an illegal and unjust imposition operates as an illegal restraint on trade and violates fundamental rights that <ORG> having held that the Constitution by article thereof made delivery of the goods for consumption the decisive factor for determining which State should have the right of taxing such sales and having thus found the provision of the Explanation to the definition of sale unconstitutional should have issued a writ of mandamus restraining the respondent State from enforcing that part of the Act To appreciate the contentions of the learned counsel it is necessary to set out the relevant provisions of the Act which <ORG> has declared ultra vires <ORG> Act XXI of defines the expression sale in section of the Act in these terms Sale with all its grammatical variations and cognate expressions means any transfer of property in goods for cash or deferred payments or other valuable consideration including transfer of property in goods made in the course of the execution of a contract but does not include a mortgage hypothecation charge or pledge I A transfer of goods on hirepurchase or other instalment system of payment shall notwithstanding that the seller retains a title to any goods as security for payment of the price be deemed to be a sale This provision was amended by the Central Provinces and Berar Act XVI of which came into force on the th of ApriL by which Explanation II of section was amended as follows Explanation II Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Indian Sale of Goods Act the sale or purchase of any goods shall be deemed for the purposes of this Act to have taken place in this Province wherever the contract of sale or purchase might have been made a If the goods were actually in this Province at the time when the contract of sale or purchase in respect thereof was made or In case the contract was for the sale or purchase of future goods by description then if the goods are actually produced or found in this Province at any time after the contract of sale or purchase in respect thereof was made Certain amendments were made in the Act by Act IV of which came into force on the st of April As pointed out above <ORG> held that the new Explanation II was ultra vires <ORG> and that the mere production of goods was not enough to make the tax payable unless the goods were appropriated to a particular contract wherein it was held that article a of the Constitution read with the Explanation thereto and construed in the light of article and article prohibits the taxation of sales or purchases involving inter State elements by all States except the State in which the goods are delivered for the purpose of consumption therein and that the view that the Explanation does not deprive the State in which the property in the goods passed of its taxing power and that consequently both the State in which the property in the goods passes and the State i which the goods are delivered for consumption have the power to tax is not correct It was also said that the con ditions requisite for the issue of a writ of mandamus were not present in the case and that it was not within the scope and purpose of article of the Constitution to decide an academic question It is plain that the State evinced an intention that it could certainly proceed to apply the penal provisions of the Act against the appellant if it failed to make the return or to meet the demand and in order to escape from such serious consequences threatened without authority of law and infringing fundamental rights relief by way of a writ of mandamus was clearly the appropriate relief These observations have apposite application to the circumstances of the present case Explanation II to section of the Act having been declared ultra vires any imposition of sales tax on the appellant in Madhya Pradesh is without the authority of law and that being so a threat by the State by using the coercive machinery of the impugned Act to I A I realize it from the appellant is a sufficient infringement of his fundamental right under article and it was clearly entitled to relief under article of the Constitution There it was held that the principle that a court will not issue a prerogative writ when an adequate alternative remedy was available could not apply where a party came to the court with an allegation that his fundamental right had been infringed and sought relief under article Before the appellant can avail of it he has to deposit the whole amount of the tax Such a provision can hardly be described as an adequate alternative remedy In the result therefore we How this appeal with costs and direct an appropriate writ to issue restraining the first respondent from imposing or authorising imposition of a tax on the appellant in exercise of its authority under Explanation held void
