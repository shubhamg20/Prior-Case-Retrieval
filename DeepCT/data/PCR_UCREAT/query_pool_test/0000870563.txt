This appeal is directed against the order in original dt He held that by their actions the goods are liable for confiscation and also they are liable for penalty under Section a of the <ORG> Act The goods shall be assesseed on merits and the duty of customs amounting to Rs On the basis of the examination the concerned Appraising Officer had definite doubts regarding the validity of the export to USSR From the details of the consignment the department gathered that the appellants had cleared a consignment declared as units of Haemafiltration Instrument Haemodialysers Life Saving equipments and Accessories and Spares for above and Acetate Concentrate and Others of West German make contained in containers vide Home Consumption The Acetate Concentrate and others were cleared on payment of duty at Basic duty Auxiliary duty and Though they cleared the goods for home consumption under Home Consumption after availing themselves of duty exemption benefits and the provisions of Stock and Sale under OGL without declaring at the time of clearance that the imported goods are meant for re export they presented the same for re export Noting all these details the department in the show cause notice alleged that the importer had contravened the provisions of Saving Clause of the Export Trade Control Order and Saving Clause of the Import Trade Control Order and the conditions of OGL of AM read with Import Export Control Act and Section of the Customs Act and accordingly these goods are liable to confiscation under Section of the Customs Act Since the goods were cleared for home consumption under NIL rate of duty under Custom Notification No but later on re exported the customs duty was payable on these goods at the appropriate rate The appellants filed a detailed reply Therefore considering the fact that the goods had already been exported he proceeded to taken action in terms of the bond Bank Guarantee and cash deposit furnished by the exporter He imposed a penalty of Rs Thus they had made a profit of more than Rs one crores in this transaction although it caused considerable loss of hard currency to the country He also held that the transaction was more motivated by the huge profit rather than the desire to held the Armenian earthquake victims which was the ostensible reason given by the exporters After the matter was decided by the <ORG> in favour of the <ORG> the appellants took the matter to Hon ble <ORG> of India While determining the case the Hon ble <ORG> in para incidentally also noted that the Hon ble <ORG> was not concerned with the questions of whether the attempt of the assessee to export the goods which has in the event been successful would amount to an infringement of the conditions permitting the import so as to render either the import itself vide Section of the Act or the exemption from the import duty or both illegal and invalid and if so the consequences thereof This was said when the Counsel for the <ORG> emphasised on the circumstances that the importer had obtained the import of the goods free of duty relying on the Notification granting exemption from customs duty in terms of proviso to Section of the <ORG> Act and also demanded as to why the goods concerned should not be held liable to confiscation under Section of the <ORG> Act and why a penalty should not be imposed under Section a of the <ORG> Act The Learned Collector after dealing with the matter on the liability to pay the duty under Notification somehow has dealt with time bar aspect without keeping in view the previous proceedings and dropping of duty demand by the Collector <NAME> The first important aspect of the matter is as to whether the <ORG> can initiate the proceedings by issue of fresh show cause notice dt months after the earlier proceedings having culminated by the judgment of <ORG> rendered on As can be seen from the judgment of the Hon ble <ORG> the <ORG> had raised the arguments before <ORG> that the importer had obtained import of the goods free of duty by relying on the Notification granting exemption from the customs duty The Hon ble <ORG> after noting such arguments of the <ORG> proceeded to say that the intention is therefore relevant for the issue before the court to the limited extent that it lends support to the construction of List of Appendix in the manner the court interpreted it Further the Hon ble <ORG> proceeded to say that they were not concerned with the question whether the attempt of the assessee to export the goods which is in the event been successful would amount to infringement of the conditions permitting the import so as to render either import itself vide Section of the Act or the exemption from import duty or both illegal and invalid and if so the consequences thereof It can be very clearly noticed that in the previous proceedings the Collector dropped the demands for duty both on the ground that he did not have jurisdiction and also that the duty is not demandable as the goods were exempted under the Notification The relevant has also been defined in Sub section of Section means a in a case where duty is not levied the date on which the proper officer makes an order for the clearance of the goods in a case where duty is provisionally assessed under Section the date of adjustment of duty after the final assessment thereof in a case where duty has been erroneously refunded the date of refund in any other case the date of payment of duty Therefore from the facts and circumstances of the case it appears that on a different opinion being taken by Collector Bombay in the matter other than that expressed by the <ORG> <ORG> and <ORG> in the matter In view of the findings given on the time bar and the unsustainability of the proceedings the question of entering into the merits would not arise in the present case However the counsel had also argued on this aspect and had relied on several rulings and had also pointed out that <ORG> had been granting benefit of the <ORG> similar circumstances when goods were exported without any manufacturing process carried out and the goods having been utilised for home consumption We notice that on this aspect of the matter <ORG> has very clearly held in para that although there is no express prohibition the re export as such of items of goods specified in List and imported into India is prohibited by necessary implication by the language of and the scheme underlying the grant of OGL in regard to them The Learned DR submitted that there is mis declaration and that the appellants were required to have declared in the Bill of Entry the purpose for which the imported goods are required that they would be used in India only or would be sold in India or would be exported outside India without any process of manufacture being carried out The expression home consumption has also in the context no clear or definite meaning and raised a lot of conundrums if literally interpreted to mean that imported goods should always be consumed in India The court raised question that is it home consumption if the importer does not use the goods himself but sells them At what point of time should the importer make up his mind whether he proposes to sell the imported goods in India or wishes to export them outside The Court again raised the question that is the condition infringed if a purchaser of goods from the importer sells it to buyer in a foreign country Will it be permissible for the importer to use the imported goods in the manufacture of other goods which he proposes to export <ORG> answered that all these uncertainties in the connotation of the expression home consumption preclude one from giving an interpretation to this expression that the imported goods cannot be at all exported and incline one to hold that in the context it is only used in contrast to the expression for warehousing <ORG> in para precisely answered that the charges raised in the present show cause notice about the importer making capital of the export and did not accept the <ORG> interpretation and also held that it is possible to think of cases where though economically unremunerative the re exports can be justified on considerations of international amity and goodwill such as for example where the goods are exported to a country which is in dire need of help and assistance The above general consideration apart there are other indications in the statute which show that the Act does not prohibit the export of imported goods The Act provides that goods which are cleared from the customs area for warehousing can be cleared from the warehouse for home consumption It is indeed suggested by <ORG> counsel that if an importer intends to export the imported goods he should clear them for warehousing and then proceed in terms of Section But where for one reason or other he wants to import the goods into India and then sell them to the foreign country or where the importer decides on an export sale only after he has arranged for the import of the goods into India the Act prescribes no form of a Bill of Entry under which he can clear such goods intended for re export Whether to deposit the goods in warehouse or not is an option given to the importer But where he has either some difficulty in payment of the duties or where he has no ready place to stock the goods before use or sale he cannot clear the goods from the customs area There is nothing in the provisions of the Act to compel an importer even before or when importing the goods to make up his mind whether he is going to use or sell them in India or whether he proposes to re export them It would make export trade difficult to say that he cannot accept the export offer as the goods when imported had been cleared for home consumption Section therefore should be only read as a provision setting out the procedure for export of warehoused goods and not as a provision which makes warehousing an imperative pre condition for exporting the imported goods Incidentally we may observe that even this principle contended for by <ORG> may itself be of doubtful validity as it is based on an erroneous assumption that a re export of imported goods will always be detrimental to the country But conceivably there may be cases where an importer is able to import goods from soft currency area and sell them in a hard currency area earning foreign exchange for the country It is also possible to think of cases where though economically unremunerative the re exports can be justified on considerations of international amity and goodwill such as for example where the goods are exported to a country which is in a dire need of help and assistance The question raised by the <ORG> in the present case are also answered by <ORG> as can be clearly noted Member I am writing my separate order as under Proviso to Section of the <ORG> Act provides that where any duty has not been levied or has not been short levied or erroneously refunded by reason of collusion or any wilful mis statement or suppression of facts by the importer or the exporter the provisions of Sub section will have the effect as if for the words Proper Officer the words Collector of <ORG> and for the words One Year and Six Months the words Five Years were substituted Collector of <ORG> Kandla has jurisdiction only in regard to Port at Kandla and such other areas as are specified in the Notification issued by the Government Likewise Collector of <ORG> Bombay has jurisdiction in regard to matters pertaining to specified Bombay region <ORG> held <ORG> has issued notifications under Section of the <ORG> Act appointing Collectors of <ORG> and lower officers for different jurisdictions In terms of these notifications the respective jurisdictions of the Collectors have been clearly spelt out see for example Notification No Cus Notification No dated as amended appoints the Collector of <ORG> and <ORG> Cochin as the Collector of <ORG> in his jurisdiction Evidently it does not extend to Madras Port for which the Collector is the Collector of <ORG> Madras vide Notification No dated There are of course a few officers appointed as Collectors with all India jurisdiction such as the Director of Revenue Intelligence but the Collector of <ORG> Cochin is not one among them In these circumstances we hold that the Collector of <ORG> Cochin had no jurisdiction to demand duty in the present case and consequently we set aside the demand dated as amended <ORG> in exercise of powers conferred by Sub section of Section of <ORG> Act have appointed officers mentioned in Column of the Table appended to the Notification to be Collectors of <ORG> It may not therefore be possible to hold that proceedings had already been initiated and therefore fresh proceedings could not be initiated It can therefore be seen that it was not fresh proceeding initiated by the proper officer after he had initially initiated the proceedings and dropped the demand of duty In fact Collector of <ORG> <ORG> while dropping the demand himself admitted that he had no jurisdiction in relation to the matter pertaining to duty It is not the case of the appellants that as soon as they were penalised at <ORG> or they were issued a Show Cause Notice by <ORG> <ORG> they made disclosure of these facts to the proper officer in relation to the imports i Collector of <ORG> Bombay Collector of <ORG> Bombay therefore was competent to initiate proceedings against the appellants as soon as he came to know that a short levy had indeed taken place since goods had been exported and this fact had not been disclosed to the proper officer <ORG> held that the circumstances that these items are also exempt from customs duty at the time of import also lends support to the conclusion that the goods so permitted are not meant for re export <ORG> therefore held We are therefore of the opinion that although there is no express prohibition the re export as such of items of goods specified in List and imported into India is prohibited by necessary implication by the language of and the scheme underlying the grant of OGL in regard to them Here we have a situation where goods have been contracted for re export even prior to their import In the statement dated of Shri <NAME> it is indicated that they had prior orders for exporting these items and they had to check the feasibility of import of these commodities taking into consideration the duty free import under Notification No It is also admitted by him that they made a gross profit of approximately Rs He also admitted to have availed benefit of notification to import goods with no import duty and that the interest was purely business interest It has also been admitted by him that the goods were imported and cleared form <ORG> with the sole purpose of exporting these to Russia with a business intention and to earn adequate profits It is therefore clear that even prior to import of goods cleared under duty exemption the appellants had entered into Contract for re export of these goods as such to earn profits In the light of this it is obvious that the appellants when they imported goods and claimed duty free exemption already knew that they would be exporting the goods and they knew also that they could not export these goods without subjecting them to certain processes and therefore as was contended by the <ORG> before <ORG> they put up a facade of taking the goods to Ankleshwar after their import allegedly for being subjected to some processes <ORG> in case of <NAME> ECR SC held that extended period is applicable where there was wilful mis statement and suppression of facts by the importer In the instant case the appellant had obtained the import licence dated February for expansion of its business on the recommendation of the Director of Industries Kerala State and the said import licence contained specific endorsement of Project Import When the goods arrived at the port in India the appellant filed a Bill of Entry on November with the customs authorities which contained a declaration signal by a partner of the appellant In addition the appellant submitted an application form dated November before the customs authorities for Registration under Project Import Registration of Contracts Regulations wherein it was stated that the goods to be imported were for substantial expansion of an existing plant and that the existing installed capacity of the plant of the appellant was sq There is nothing on the record to show that the appellant had informed the customs authorities that the machinery to be imported would be transferred by the appellant to the <ORG> and the <ORG> would install the same On the other hand the endorsement on the import licence submitted with the Bill of Entry which contained a declaration by a partner of the appellant and the statements contained in the application from for Registration dated November indicated that the appellant would be using the imported machinery for substantial expansion of its existing unit and on that basis the appellant was assessed for duty at a concessional rate under Head ing No of the Customs Tariff Since the appellant did not install the said machinery for the expansion of its existing unit but transferred it to the <ORG> after it had been cleared from the customs the appellant cannot claim the benefit of the concessional rate of duty under Heading No of the Customs Tariff and is liable to pay such duty at the normal rates prescribed in the Customs Tariff In Sub section of Section it is prescribed that a notice shall be served on the person chargeable with the duty requiring him to show cause why he should not pay the amount specified in the notice The said notice has to be served within one year of the relevant date in cases when import is made by an individual for his personal use or by <ORG> or by an educational research or charitable institution or hospital and the period for service of such notice is six months in other cases The proviso to Sub section of Section enhances the aforementioned periods for service of the notice to five years in cases where any duty has not been levied or has been short levied or erroneously refunded by reasons of collusion or any wilful misstatement or suppression of facts by the importer or the exporter or the agent or employee of the importer or exporter The present case falls within the ambit of the said proviso because the appellant had cleared the goods from the customs on payment of concessional rate of duty under Heading No of the Customs Tariff by making a misstatement in the application form dated November for registration under the Project Import Registration of Contracts Regulations that the machinery that had been imported was for substantial expansion of the existing industrial unit of the appellant and by suppressing the fact that under Agreement dated July the appellant had agreed to transfer the said machinery to the <ORG> In the circumstances the Collector was justified in directing that the goods in question should be re assessed to duty on merits under the appropriate heading of the Customs Tariff without giving the benefit of the assessment under Heading and to collect the short levy from the appellant Considering goods had been contracted for export even prior to import and yet they claimed exemption when they knew such exemption could not be availed of in case goods were for re export as such extended period for demanding duty was sustainable In view of difference of opinion between the Members the following question arises for determination by Third Member on reference of the matter by Hon ble President Whether the appeal is required to be allowed in terms of findings given by Member <ORG> in his order or The appeal is required to be rejected in terms of the order recorded by Member Technical in his order I have heard both sides on difference of opinion The facts are set out in the first eight paragraphs of the order of the judicial member order and therefore I do not propose to repeat them It is first contended by the advocate for the appellant that the demand is barred by limitation The notice issued in April for goods imported in invokes the extended period provided in Section of the Act on the ground that the importer did not declare on the bill of entry till investigation commenced that the goods were intended to be exported to the USSR He points out that <ORG> has clearly held that the demand is barred by limitation On merits he contends that when the goods were imported in the appellant was under the bonafide impression that notification would apply and the goods were for stock and sale Going by the plain meaning of the policy and the notification the appellant had every reason to believe that the goods were intended to be imported under OGL and were exempt from duty when they were imported The point if any in export has been wiped out and there is no reason to deny the importation There is no material to show this and the order itself says that he came to know from intelligence He says that it is not possible to say whether the earlier exports were of goods disclosed to be imported goods and they may have been declared as goods manufactured in India It had also observed in para that it would not have been the intention of the legislature to grant exemption from <ORG> duty in respect of vital goods and in order that the importer may make profit by selling them abroad In that the notification was issued in the public interest which means the interest of the public in India Member Judicial has found that the proceedings were barred by limitation because the full facts were known to the Collector of <ORG> Kandla when he issued the demand for duty and subsequently dropped it The view of the Member Technical is that there are clear territorial division with which each Collector exercise his jurisdiction and it does not follow that merely because the Collector of <ORG> Kandla initiated and dropped the proceedings for duty the Collector of <ORG> at Mumbai was aware of the imported goods sought to be re exported The import took place in October and the notice was issued in April i four years and six months after the importation The Collector also says that the appellant took the goods to Ankleshwar ostensibly for processing although no such processing has been carried out The attribute of the goods being a life saving drug medicine or equipment would continue whether the goods are utilised for that purpose in India or elsewhere Member <NAME> finds the notice was barred by limitation as the revenue had all the information to initiate proceedings for recovery of duty <ORG> in MJ Exports CEGAT in para itself noted that there nothing in the provisions of the <ORG> Act to compel an importer even before or when importing the goods to make up his mind whether he is going to use or sell them in India or whether he proposes to re export them It would make export trade difficult to say that he cannot accept such an offer as the goods when imported had been cleared for home consumption The <ORG> in making its observation was interpreting the provisions of Sections and of the Act and answering the contention of the revenue before it that the goods cleared for home consumption are prohibited for export In that situation obviously the extended period could not be invoked on the ground that there was suppression of facts or mis statement It is however possible that he may have changed his mind and decided to keep the goods in India say that if the deal with Russia fell through or was cancelled because of it is more profitable to sell the goods in India This would also lend support to the plea that there was no bar to export of such goods For the extended period provided in the proviso to Section to apply in the facts of this case it must be shown that the appellant while being aware that the benefit of the notification would not be available for the reason that export of goods subsequent to import under and clearance under the notification was not permissible suppressed from the department the fact that the goods were to be exported I therefore agree with the Member Judicial that the demand is barred by limitation as the extended period will not apply He agreed with the submission that he had no jurisdiction to demand on the goods imported through Bombay He added that even otherwise notification exempts the goods unconditionally from import duty When once the Collector of <ORG> <NAME> admits that he has no jurisdiction and says so his subsequent observation that the demand for duty is unsustainable cannot be binding On this point I agree with the views expressed by the Member Technical There is therefore no difference of opinion on this aspect
