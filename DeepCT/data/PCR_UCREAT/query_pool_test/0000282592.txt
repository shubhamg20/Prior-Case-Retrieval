promotion under the Special Recruitment Regulations the petitioner contended that i he had a right to hold a post in the senior scale of pay from April ii under the rules seventy five per cent of the total number of senior posts was exclusively reserved for direct recruits and that in computing the twenty five per cent quota officers in Lists and III and special recruits had to be included iii of the Recruitment Rules which authorised <ORG> to make regulation for special recruitment was bad on the ground of excessive deletation iv of the Regulation of Seniority Rules made unjust discrimination between a promotee and a direct recruit in the matter of seniority by arbitrarily allotting a lower year of allotment to a promotee and therefore violated Arts i The filling of a vacancy by a non

Regulations Regulation pro vides that special recruitment will be made a by direct recruitment by selection and by promotion to the Service by selection of persons serving in connection with the affairs of the <ORG> Regulations and adopt for the purposes of special recruitment the regulations for appointment by competitive examination promotion and selection made under rules and of the Recruitment Rules with appropriate modifications Rule of I A Pay Rules prescribes the scales of pay admissible to the members of the Service Rule provides that the initial pay of a direct recruit shall be fixed at the minimum of the junior time scale Rule provides that the pay of a member of the Service in the junior time scale shall on appointment to a post on the senior time scale be fixed at the corresponding stage of the senior time scale as shown in Sch Rule of I A Regulation of Seniority Rules provides that every officer shall be assigned a year of allotment Rule a provides inter alia that the year of allotment of an officer appointed to the Service after the commencement of these rules shall be where the officer is appointed to the Service on the results of a competitive examination the year following the year in which such examination was held Rule provides that the year of allotment of an officer shall be where the officer is appointed to the Service by promotion in accordance with subrule of rule of the Recruitment Rules the year of allotment of the junior most among the officers recruited to the Service in accordance with rule of those rules who officiated continuously in a senior post from a date earlier than the date of commencement of such officiation by the former The proviso to lays down that the year of allotment of an officer appointed to the Service in accordance with sub rule of rule of the Recruitment Rules who started officiating continuously in a senior post from a date earlier than the date on which any of the officer recruited to the Service in accordance with rule of those Rules so started officiating shall be determined ad hoc by <ORG> in consultation with the State Government concerned Rule provides for preparation of a gradation list of all officers borne on the cadre arranged in order of seniority In July he was served with a charge sheet and he submitted a reply Before the enquiry started he was reverted to his substantive rank of Assistant Superintendent of Police Other officers junior to him continued to officiate in the senior scale while he was reverted His personal file revealed a note by the Senior Superintendent of Police to the effect that a regular en quiry into his conduct would take a long time and it was advisable to revert him He was not given any opportunity of showing cause against the action taken against him He filed a writ petition in <ORG> asking for the issue of a writ quashing the order of reversion On appeal this Court set aside the order of <ORG> and allowed the petition The majority held that the reversion was by way of punishment and amounted to reduction in rank and withholding of promotion on grounds which may be summarised thus There is only one cadre in <ORG> A person in the junior time scale of the Service is as much a cadre officer as one holding a post in the senior time scale or a post above the time scale <NAME> said that the whole scheme of the rules indicates that a person borne on the junior scale of pay has a right to hold a post on the senior scale of pay depending upon the availability of a post and his seniority in the junior scale of pay The learned Judge added Despite the fact that he holds a certain rank in the gradation list persons who also belong to <ORG> and who were recruited to it subsequent to him have continued to hold or have been appointed to hold posts carrying salary in the senior scale This would itself indicate that the action taken against him was by way of penalty or punishment For he has not only been reduced in rank but his promotion to the senior scale has also been withheld In this background the petitioner says that he was deprived of his right to hold a senior post during the period from April up to November We have found already that on April there was no available vacancy in the senior post to which he should be appointed The petitioner contends that he had the absolute right to be appointed to a vacancy in the senior posts on and after April the filling of the vacancies by non cadre officers on the ground that he was not suitable was an infringement of his right and amounted to withholding of promotion and a penalty within the meaning of of the All India Services Discipline and Appeal Rules per cent of the total number of senior posts was reserved exclusively for direct recruits and in computing the per cent quota under of the Recruitment Rules officers in Lists and III and special recruits should be included This right is infringed if the junior cadre officer is promoted to fill a vacancy in the senior scale while he continues to hold a post in the junior scale of pay But he cannot claim the right to fill the vacancy if he is not suitable and no cadre officer junior to him is promoted to fill the vacancy An officer in the junior scale of pay has no right to a senior post as soon as he joins the Service He may be appointed to a senior post only when he is found suitable having regard to his length of service experience and performance in the junior scale of pay Under of the Cadre Rules a senior cadre post may be filled by a non cadre officer if there is no suitable officer available for filling the vacancy As against cadre officers junior to him he had the right to hold the post in the senior scale of pay The reversion while cadre officers junior to him continued in the senior scale amounted to not only reduction in rank but also withholding of promotion Nor was he reverted after his promotion while officers junior to him continued to hold senior posts The petitioner was not reduced in rank nor was his promotion withheld He had no right to fill a vacancy in the senior posts or to draw salary in the senior scale between April and November There is no merit in the contention that per cent of the total number of senior posts is reserved exclusively for direct recruits Under of the Recruitment Rules the number of persons recruited to senior posts under of the Recruitment Rules by promotion or by selection cannot exceed per cent of the total number of senior posts Paragraph iv of the I A Extension to States Scheme provided that the posts held by officers included in Lists and III would be excluded from the cadre for the period they were held by those officers and would revert to the cadre as and when they ceased to be required for that purpose The posts held by the officers in List III were excluded from the cadre until they retired and were not counted against the per cent quota The posts held by the officers in List pending absorption in the service were excluded from the cadre They were absorbed in the service as and when they were found fit There were vacancies in the per cent quota which were filled up by promotion of respondents Nos and from <ORG> No appointments were made between November and November when the petitioner was appointed to officiate in a senior post Other respondents were appointed after November He has not given any adequate explanation as to the delay in filing the writ petition The petitioner challenges the vires of of the Recruitment Rules under which <ORG> framed the Special Recruitment Regulations From the point of view of the promotee his seniority should be counted from the date of his joining <ORG> From the point of view of the direct recruit the seniority of the promotee should be counted from the date of his appointment to <ORG> It gives the promotee the year of allotment of the junior most direct recruit officiating continuously in a senior post earlier than the date of commencement of such officiation by the promotee The petitioner next challenges the validity of Regulation of the Special Recruitment Seniority Regulations on the ground that it offends Arts There is no substance in this contention
