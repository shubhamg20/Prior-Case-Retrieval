I have bad the advantage of perusing the judgment prepared by my learned brother <NAME> and I am in entire agreement with his reasoning and conclusion If I add a few words it is because the question raised in the case is not covered by decided authority She sold a house which was a part of the joint family property to the first appellant in this second appeal In the ordinary course <NAME> would have become entitled to the entire joint family property on the death of his brother <NAME> But the appellant relied on the right conferred on a widow by Section of the Hindu Women Rights to Property Act hereinafter referred to as the Act To meet this claim based on that Act the plea was raised on behalf of the contesting respondent that at the time of the death of her husband <NAME> was leading an unchaste life and lived in adultery with a person at Kumbakonam This fact has been found by both the Courts below and the claim of the appellant based on the Act negatived on the ground that by reason of her un chastity the widow was disqualified from acquiring any interest under the Act The contention on behalf of the appellant before us was that Section of the Act conferred upon the widow an unrestricted and unqualified right to take the property of the husband in the same interest as the husband himself had and her unchastity would not disqualify her from acquiring that interest The material provisions of the Act run as follows When a Hindu governed by the Dayabhag School of Hindu law dies intestate leaving any property and when a Hindu governed by any other school of Hindu law or by customary law dies intestate leaving separate property his widow or if there is more than one widow all his widows together shall subject to the provisions of Sub section be entitled in respect of property in respect of which he dies intestate to the same share as a son Where a Hindu governed by any school of Hindu law other than the Dayabhag school or by customary law dies having at the time of his death an interest in a Hindu joint family property his widow shall subject to the provisions of Sub section have in the property the same interest as he himself had The appellant contention is based upon the language of Section which declares that the provisions of Section shall apply notwithstanding any rule of Hindu law to the contrary and on the fact that no disqualification is expressly mentioned in Section The dominant purpose in construing a statute is to ascertain the intention of the <ORG> When the enactment is in the nature of an amending provision that is to say a provision which amends the general law on the subject in any particular it should not be interpreted so as to alter completely the character of the principal law unless clear language is found indicating such intention There is always a presumption that the <ORG> does not intend to make any substantial alteration in the law beyond what it expressly declares either in express terms or by clear implication or in other words beyond the immediate scope and object of the statute Statutes regulating heirship or descent or giving force to wills and to the devises contained in wills should be read as not intended to affect paramount questions of public policy or depart from well settled principles of jurisprudence general words are to be construed so as to pursue the intent of the makers of statutes and so as to import all these implied exceptions which arise from a close consideration of the mischiefs sought to be remedied and of the state of the law at the moment when the statute was passed A at The object is stated in the preamble thus Whereas it is expedient to amend the Hindu law to give better rights to women in respect of property Inter alia under the law as it stood before the Act a Hindu widow who was not unchaste was entitled to inherit to the separate property of her husband when he died intestate and leaving no son or son son or son son son if there was a son she was entitled to claim maintenance against the son and if the property was joint family property against the coparceners of her husband provided she was not unchaste There is another aspect of the matter which in my opinion throws considerable light on the scope of the Act It appears to me to be clear that this Act has not expressly or by implication removed the disqualification on the ground of unchastity which is based on ethical foundations and the sentiment of the people It was argued for the appellant that Section did not make any exception or impose any restriction on the right conferred on the widow The answer to this contention is that if by any rule of law in force at the time of the enactment there is a disqualification or disability from acquiring any right unless such disqualification or disability is expressly or by necessary intendment removed by the Act the provisions of the Act must be read subject to such general rules of law To give an instance there is a rule of Hindu law which is also a rule of general public policy that a murderer is disqualified from inheriting to the estate of the murdered man Can it be successfully contended that a wife who has murdered her husband would be entitled to the rights conferred on her by of the Act The learned advocate for the appellant was not prepared to go this length and I believe rightly that in the Municipal Corporation Acts words importing the masculine gender shall include females for all purposes connected with the right to vote at the election of Councillors auditors and assessors It seems quite clear that this statute had not married women in its contemplation <NAME> said that the Act only removed the disqualification by reason of sex and left untouched the disqualification by reason of status In my opinion if the <ORG> intended to confer rights on even widows who were otherwise disqualified under the general rule of Hindu law then it would have given expression to that intention Much reliance was placed on Section which declares that the provisions of Section shall apply notwithstanding any rule of Hindu law or custom to the contrary If there is any rule of Hindu law or custom which is contrary to the provisions of Section then it is such a rule that is abrogated and not every rule of Hindu law which is not directly contradicted by the provisions of Section I have therefore come to the conclusion that we are not obliged to hold that the effect of the enactment is to bring about something not intended by the <ORG> as the learned Editor of Edn The draftsman of the Act has assumed a knowledge of the existing state of Hindu law on the part of those who have to interpret it I might indicate at the outset what I consider to be the proper mode of approach to the construction of the Act at pages and the rule of construction applicable to cases like the present is thus stated It is in the last degree improbable that the <ORG> would overthrow fundamental principles infringe rights or depart from the general system of law without expressing its intention with irresistible clearness and to give any such effect to general words simply because they have a meaning that would lead thereto when used in either their widest their usual or their natural sense would be to give them a meaning other than that which was really intended In construing the words of the Act of Parliament we are justified in assuming that the <ORG> did not intend to go against the ordinary rules of law unless the language they have used obliges the <ORG> to come to the conclusion they did so intend It has been observed by <ORG> and this Court that though the Act conferred new rights of succession upon widows yet in view of its far reaching consequences on other branches of the Hindu law the Act should be so construed as to make no further inroad into the Hindu law than is warranted by its plain terms <NAME> also declares Let the sonless widow preserving unsullied the bed of her lord and bidding with her venerable protector enjoy with moderation the husband property until her death Other texts state that as half the body of her deceased husband the widow takes his property in default of male issue The use of the present participle form implies that chastity is imposed as a permanent condition of the widow enjoyment of her husband estate and that a violation of that condition would involve a forfeiture of the right But European writers like <NAME> and English Judges who had to administer the Hindu law in their concern for ensuring certainty of titles to property and their leanings against a divestiture of estates once vested declared the law to be that a sonless widow who was chaste at the time of her husband death inherited his estate and that a widow who had once inherited the estate of her husband was not liable to forfeit it by reason of her subsequent unchastity Maintenanee being a recurring right her continued chastity is a condition of her right to receive maintenance and she would forfeit her right by reason of her unchastity even though maintenance has been decreed to her by a Court If there has been a lapse from chastity the widow would be entitled only if she reforms her ways and even then only to a starving maintenance <NAME> <NAME> Mad The Act was doubtless intended to give better rights to women in respect of property as stated in the preamble But in what cases and to what extent The rights of a Hindu widow in relation to the property or interest of her husband as they stood before the Act and as they now stand have to be considered She would have had a right however to be maintained from the joint family property in the hands of the surviving coparceners who might be her son or her husband uncles brothers nephews or other agnatie relations With reference to these two classes of cases above specified Section of the Act conferred new rights of succession on widows in supersession of the above mentioned rules of Hindu law Though the Act conferred new rights of succession on Hindu widows in the two classes of cases referred to above it did not purport to abrogate the pre existing rule of Hindu law excluding an unchaste widow from succession to the property of her husband It would be a queer state of law that a sonless widow has to be chaste in order to inherit her husband separate or self acquired property but a widow need not be chaste if she happens to have sons or other coparceners of her husband in competition with whom she claims to take her husbands estate This is left to be determined by the general law I refer to these matters to show that the Act is not exhaustive oc self contained and must be fitted into the context of the existing Hindu law except to the extent forbidden by its plain terms For instance this enactment would not remove the disqualification based on the widow unchastity imposed by the Hindu law though it removed the disqualification arising from apostacy Reliance has been placed by the learned counsel on the language of Section of the Act which runs thus Notwithstanding any rule of Hindu law or custom to the contrary the provisions of Section shall apply when a Hindu dies intestate The significance of the words to the contrary following the words Notwithstanding any rule of Hindu law in Section is that it is only such rules of Hindu law as are contrary to the provisions of Section of the Act that stand abrogated The disqualification of a Hindu widow from succession to her husband estate based on her unchastity was not even touched upon by the Act and there is nothing in The object has been amply achieved by Section which gives Hindu widows rights of succession to their husband estate in supersession of the rules of Hindu law which in the circumstances specified in the section gave them a mere maintenance out of that estate The family a pivotal institution extolled by <ORG> depended for its unsullied cohesiveness and continuity upon the sanctity of marital relationship with its attendant obligation of chastity I consider it improbable that the <ORG> would have overthrown the well established and fundamental principle of Hindu law founded in the deep rooted sentiments of the people that chastity is a condition precedent to a widow right to inherit her husband estate without expressing its intention with irresistible clearness I also venture to think that it could not have been the intention of the Act to give a charter of unchastity to married women or to abrogate the inhibitions of a law designed to preserve the purity and sanctity of family life Unless there is no reasonable way of escape I must decline to attribute to the legislature so wayward an intention <NAME> have had the advantage of going through the judgments of my brother <NAME> and my Lord the Chief Justice I unhesitatingly agree with their conclusions that the Hindu Women Eights to Property Act Act XVIII of has not abrogated either expressly or impliedly the Hindu law rule that a wife who is unchaste cannot succeed to her husband property whether joint family property or self acquired property and that the opinion to the contrary expressed by the learned authors of Mayne Hindu Law Edns The omission is therefore similar to the omission of the disqualification in the Hindu Women Eights to Property Act by <ORG> which expressly mentions the disqualification in the Hindu Married Women Eight to Separate Residence and Maintenance Act of nine years later showing that it never intended to abrogate it for the purposes of the Act which conferred far more valuable rights The Hindu members of the <ORG> who formed the vast majority in both the <ORG> which passed the Act could never have intended to interfere with this deep rooted feeling of the race Nor can the argument that the Act is a self contained Act and therefore effect must be given to Section despite all pre existing disqualifications under Hindu law be accepted at But it must be remembered that the Act was not a codifying Act or even a genera amendment of the Hindu Law of Inheritance It will help us to ascertain the precise scope of the Act if we can ascertain the defects which it set out to remedy Even the learned authors of Mayne Hindu Law Edns They say Where the provisions of the Act are clear effect of course must be given to them There is nothing against public policy in retaining the disqualification of unchastity for a wife seeking to inherit her husband property It was urged that commonsense requires the removal of the disqualification as there is no divesting of the estate from a widow who was chaste when she inherited it and began to live in adultery later on So this will be a case falling within <NAME> famous rule A hundred texts cannot annul a settled fact There is nothing unjust in requiring chastity in a wife before she seeks to inherit her husband property He who seeks equity must do equity is the well known rule of equity For all these reasons I have no hesitation whatever in agreeing with the conclusions of <NAME> and my Lord the Chief Justice This second appeal must be dismissed with costs
