declining to call for a statement of case on a question of law by rejecting the application under section of the Act are under challenge in the appeals on certificate granted by <ORG> Dismissing the appeals the <ORG> HELD If there are some primary facts from which reasonable belief could be formed that there was some non disclosure or failure to disclose fully and truly all material facts the Income Tax Officer has jurisdiction to reopen the assessment But if there is omission to disclose material facts then subject to the other conditions jurisdiction to reopen is attracted What facts are material facts would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case If over depreciation has been allowed on the basis that the entire work consisted of masonry work income might have been under assessed The assessee must make full disclosure truly There may be omission or failure to make a true and full disclosure but if some material for the assessment lay embedded in the evidence which the revenue could have uncovered but did not then it is the duty of the assessee to bring it to the notice of the assessing authority The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> These appeals are by certificate from the decision of <ORG> dated st June whereby <ORG> had declined the application made under section of the Income Tax Act hereinafter called the Act wherein the assessee sought two questions to be referred to <ORG> The questions were Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the re assessment proceedings under section a of the Income tax Act initiated by the Income tax Officer for the assessment years to against the assessee were valid in law Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the <ORG> was justified in up holding the action under section a of the Income Tax Act for the assessment years to The real question therefore is whether there were facts from which it could be believed that there was failure or omission to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for the assessment as a result of which income has escaped assessment The assessment was sought to be re opened for the years to for failure to disclose fully and truly all material facts What facts are material for a particular case would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case there must be escapement of tax or under assessment due to such failure or omission In this case the reason for the belief of the Income Tax Officer was that the assessee had obtained depreciation at per cent on the assets which were masonry works but the assets really consisted of earth work wholly or substantially If that was the position then the assessee was not entitled to depreciation as was granted It is further the case of assessee that there was discussion on this Valuation Report It further appears from the assessment Order and the affidavit that the Valuation Report was discussed and the amount of depreciation was more or less agreed to between the parties It appears however from the order of the <ORG> that by its last letter addressed to the Income Tax Officer the assessee had conveyed its agreement that for the purpose of depreciation the value should be taken as Rs in the aggregate in the assessment There is also no dispute that depreciation at is available only in respect of such assets constructed of masonry and not if made of earth The fact that for the assessment years to excessive depreciation allowance had been allowed in the original assessments and income chargeable to tax had escaped assessment and or was under assessed for these years was also not in dispute The only question therefore is whether there was failure on the part of the assessee to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for assessment and future whether such income escaped assessment and whether such escapement or under assessment has been caused as a result of the failure or omission on the part of the assessee to disclose fully and truly all material facts What facts are material facts would depend upon the facts and circumstances of a particulate case If over depreciation has been allowed on that basis i that the entirety of the work consisted of masonry work income might have been under assessed <NAME> as the learned Chief Justice then was observed in <ORG> case supra that mere production of evidence before the Income tax Officer was not enough that there may be omission or failure to make a true and full disclosure if some material for the assessment lay embedded in the evidence which the revenue could have uncovered but did not then it is the duty of the assessee to bring it to the notice of the assessing authority But if there is omission to disclose material facts then subject to the other conditions jurisdiction to re open is attracted It is sufficient to refer to the decision of this Court in <ORG> case supra where it had been held that if there are some primary facts from which reasonable belief could be formed that there was some non disclosure or failure to disclose fully and truly all material facts the I has jurisdiction to reopen the assessment
