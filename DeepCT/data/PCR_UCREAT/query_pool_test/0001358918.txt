The learned Judge passed the decree mentioned above and also directed custody of the children to the petitioner There is no collusion between the parties There is no proof of connubial intercourse after the adultery which would be a prima facie evidence of condonation The petitioner has not slumbered in sufficient comfort and there is no unreasonable delay in presenting the petition There is a letter of the husband to the wife in the present case Ext There is no other letter There is no other item of the conduct of the husband which is admitted and which is consistent with the contents of the said letter It has been pointed out in a number of cases that rarely the parties are surprised in a direct act of adultery Rayden on Divorce th Edn Association coupled with opportunity illicit affection undue familiarity guilty attachment are some of the instances which create an inference upon which the <ORG> can act There is an old legal maxim in Scotland which runs as follows Solus cum sole in suspecto loco non presumitur dicere pater noster which being translated means that when a man and a woman are found together under suspicious circumstances it cannot be presumed that they are saying their prayers In the case of an adultery no higher proof of a fact is demanded than that it is established beyond all reasonable doubt The statute lays down a standard and puts adultery on the same footing as Cruelty desertion or unsoundness of mind The rule as to the standard of proof laid down at by Lord <NAME> in <ORG> in the case of <ORG> It is held that it is the duty of the <ORG>s to pronounce a decree only when it is satisfied that the case has been proved beyond reasonable doubt as to the commission of a matrimonial offence The evidence in the present case satisfies the above tests I am not unmindful of the general notions that the proceeding under Section of the Act has no exact parallel in other countries that the petition for divorce is not of the nature of an undefended civil suit that such cases are not to be decided on ground of sympathy and that it is also not enough for one of the parties to come forward and say exactly following the terms of the Act but it seems to me repugnant that <ORG> should be so little in accord with the common notions of mankind that it should require the evidence to displace fantastic suggestions As so often occurs in human affairs however the difficulty lies in drawing the line Reluctant as I am as a matter of general principle to dissolve a union unless it becomes impossible to allow it to continue and there are compelling circumstances in favour of dissolution in all the circumstances of this case I think I should be going far beyond any other authorities and should be ignoring altogether the paramount consideration applicable to such cases viz I find that there is sufficient legal evidence to support the decree
