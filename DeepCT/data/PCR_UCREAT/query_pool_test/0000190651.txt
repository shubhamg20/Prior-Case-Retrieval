This is an application filed by nine petitioners under Article of the Constitution of India It may be stated here that further proceedings in the <ORG> below have been stayed by this <ORG> by an order dated the th of September while admitting this application learned Counsel for the petitioners submitted mainly that the order of the learned <NAME> dated the th of September is not in accordance with law inasmuch as the learned <NAME> has not complied with the specific requirements of Sub section A of Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure This argument of the learned Counsel is based on the fact that the petitioners who were the first party in the proceeding Under Section of the Code had filed affidavits of persons two were before the learned Magistrate when he had passed the order on the th of February and which affidavits were on the record before the learned <NAME> when he was dealing with the case It has been mentioned in paragraph of the petition filed in this Court that the petitioners had filed affidavits of persons which had been sent to the learned <NAME> with the record of the case It appears from paragraph that the petitioners had filed various other documents also before the learned Magistrate but that they had withdrawn those other documents for the purpose of filing them before <ORG> It is therefore urged that the order of the learned <NAME> dated the th of September is vitiated on the ground that the learned <NAME> has not considered the several affidavits that had been filed by the first party and which were on the record of the case It is argued that the learned <NAME> has specifically mentioned that he found no documents filed on behalf of the first party and that this conclusion of the learned <NAME> so far as this case is concerned is wrong inasmuch as the affidavits which were already on record should have been perused and considered as part of the evidence in the case Substantially upon these arguments it is submitted by the learned Counsel for the petitioners that the order of the learned <NAME> should be quashed Both the parties have also filed affidavits of many persons which appear to be oaths against oaths and does not help in determining the fact of possession Disposal of cases Under Section of the Code of Criminal ProceduTe where affidavits have been filed by both the parties stating that these affidavits appear to be oaths against oaths has not been approved by this Court in a large number of decisions It was stated in this case that the Magistrate should consider the affidavit of each deponent and should give his reasons for accepting or not accepting it The order in this case was set aside on the ground that the Judgment of the learned Magistrate was vitiated for the consideration of a the affidavits fifed on behalf of the parties Again in the case of <NAME> <NAME> the judgment the learned Magistrate was set aside on the ground that he had not considered the affidavits filed on behalf of the parties at all It was mentioned in this decision that the affidavits cannot be brushed aside by saying that they are oath against oath It was held that the Magistrate should consider the affidavits in the same manner in which oak evidence is considered Our attention has also been drawn to a recent decision of <ORG> of this Court in the case of <NAME> Criminal Revn As I have already said the Magistrate did not in this case make any attempt whatever to consider or discuss the evidence in order to find whether one or the other party was in possession or none of the parties was in possession It is only when either of the two contingencies mentioned in the sub section arises that he can refer the case to <ORG> From the exposition of law made by this <ORG> subsequent to the orders passed in the instant case it is clear that the order of reference made by the learned Magistrate on the th of February was not a proper order at all On the th of September a petition for time was filed by the first party This petition was rejected by the learned <NAME> on the ground that the case was an old one This petition was rejected by the learned <NAME> and in due course on the th of September Judgment was delivered his judgment and order the learned <NAME> has mentioned the case of the first party He has also mentioned the case of the second party and thereafter the learned <NAME> has considered in detail the oral and documentary evidence adduced on behalf of the second party He has mentioned that there was no oral evidence on behalf of the first party and he found no documentary evidence of the first party as well On a consideration of the materials that were placed before him the learned <NAME> held that the second party were in possession of the disputed property from the year It is contended by the learned Counsel for the petitioners that having stated the ease of the first party and the second party in his order the learned <ORG> was bound to consider the affidavits which were already on the record Reliance is placed on Section A of the Code of Criminal Procedure where it is mentioned that on receipt of any reference <ORG> shall peruse the evidence on record and take such further evidence as may be produced by the parties respectively consider the effect of all such evidence and after hearing the parties decide the question so referred to it It is urged that under the provision of law even if no further evidence was adduced by the first party before the learned <NAME> and even if no arguments were advanced before him the learned <NAME> had to peruse the several affidavits which had already been filed before the learned Magistrate and which on reference formed part of the record before the learned <NAME> As a matter of fact in this case the order of the learned Magistrate itself makes it clear that there were evidence on record I have already mentioned that of the voluminous documents mentioned by the learned Magistrate at least the affidavits of persons which had been filed by the members of the first party were still on the record when the case had reached the Court of the learned <NAME> There is no other alternative but to quash the order of the learned <NAME> for tote reasons given above In this connection learned Counsel for the opposite party has submitted that a direction should be given that <ORG> will now proceed to decide the case only on the materials that are already on the record I therefore remand the case with a direction that the case should now be disposed of in accordance with law and as quickly as possible
