It was alleged in the complaint that the respondent as the Chief Minister of the State had created seven Trusts one of them being <NAME> shown to be a <ORG> Trust and that he extended favours to those who made donations to the said trusts Fifty seven witnesses for prosecution were examined before the Trial Judge and draft charges were placed for his consideration The prosecution examined specific witnesses with reference to the allegations supporting the draft charges and documents were also produced to support the allegations The Trial Judge framed charges against the respondent and discharged him in respect of the remaining charges relating to the offence of cheating extortion and conspiracy The appellant aggrieved by the order refusing to frame charges on heads by the Trial Judge filed the present Criminal Appeal by Special Leave So far as the three draft charges relating to the offence punishable under IPC are concerned the learned Trial Judge was right in holding that the prosecution failed to make out a prima facie case The appeal is allowed to that extent Under of the Code de novo trial would be necessary but it is in the discretion of <ORG> to take a decision as to whether keeping all aspects in view any other person should be brought in as an accused to be tried for any of the offences involved in the case Per <NAME> Bhagwati Concurring The Code of Criminal Procedure contemplates discharge of the accused by <ORG> under in a case triable by it cases instituted upon a police report are covered by and cases instituted otherwise than on police report are dealt with in The three sections contain somewhat different provisions in regard to discharge of the accused Under the trial Judge is required to discharge the accused if he considers that there is no sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused The power to discharge is exercisable under i when the Magistrate considers for reasons to be recorded that no case against the accused has been made out which if unrebutted would warrant his conviction Notwithstanding this difference in the position there is no scope for doubt that the stage at which the Magistrate is required to consider the question of framing of charge under is a preliminary one and that the test of prima facie case has to be applied The learned Trial Judge extracted at great length both the oral evidence as also the contents of documents but there was not much of analysis to justify rejection of the material A Under i of the Code the requirement is that the evidence must be such which if not rebutted would warrant conviction of the accused The presumption raised under of the Prevention of Corruption Act is a presumption of law which a court is bound to draw once it is proved that the accused <ORG> servant received or obtained a valuable thing in the circumstances mentioned in that section The main ingredients of the charge under IPC are i that the accused was a public servant ii that he must be shown to have obtained from any person any gratification other than legal remuneration and iii that the gratification should be as a motive or reward for doing or forbearing to do any official act or for showing or forbearing to show in the exercise of his official function favour or disfavour to any person A Ordinarily when the first two ingredients are established by evidence a rebuttable presumption arises in respect of the third For an offence under IPC the essential ingredients are i the accused was a public servant ii he accepted or obtained or agreed to accept or obtain a valuable thing without consideration or for an inadequate consideration knowing it to be inadequate iii the person giving the thing must be a person concerned or interested in or related to the person concerned in any proceeding or business transacted or about to be transacted by the government servant or having any connection with the official of himself or of any public servant to whom he is subordinate and iv the accused must have knowledge that the person giving the thing is so concerned or interested or related The difference between the acceptance of a bribe made punishable under and IPC is that under the former section the present is taken as a motive or reward for abuse of office under the latter section the question of motive or reward is wholly immaterial and the acceptance of a valuable thing without consideration or with inadequate consideration from a person who has or is likely to have any business to be transacted is forbidden because though not taken as a motive or reward for showing any official favour it is likely to influence the public servant to show official favour to the person giving such valuable thing Before a person can be said to put any person to fear of any injury to that person it must appear that he has held out some threat to do or omit to do what he is legally bound to do in future If all that a man does is to promise to do a thing which he is not legally bound to do and says that if money is not paid to him he would not do that thing such act would not amount to an offence of extortion In the instant case there is no evidence at all to show that the managements of the sugar co operatives had been put in any fear and the contributions had been paid in response to threats Merely because the respondent was Chief Minister at the relevant time and the sugar co operatives had some of their grievances pending consideration before the <ORG> and pressure was brought about to make the donations promising consideration of such grievances possibly by way of recipro city there is no justification that the ingredients of the offence of extortion have been made out The evidence led by the prosecution falls short of the requirements of law in regard to the alleged offence of extortion Cheating is defined in of the and the ingredients for that offence are i there should be fraudulent or dishonest inducement of a person by deceiving him ii the person so induced should be intentionally induced to deliver any property to any person or to consent that any person shall retain any property or iii the person so induced should be intentionally induced to do or to omit to do anything which he would not do or omit if he were not so deceived and iv in cases covered by the second part of the act or omission should be one which caused or is likely to cause damage or harm to the person induced in body mind reputation or property Section actually consists of two parts each part dealing with one way of cheating i Where by deception practised upon a person the accused dishonestly or fraudulently induced that person to deliver property to any person or to consent that any person shall retain any property ii Where by deception practised upon a person the accused intentionally induces that person to do or omit to do anything which he would not do or omit to do if he were not so deceived and which act or omission causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to that person in body mind reputation or property A charge under IPC should therefore be framed by the learned Trial Judge against the respondent Per Bhagwati <NAME> concurring When the court is considering under sub of the Code of Criminal Procedure whether any case has been made out against the accused which if unrebutted would warrant his conviction it is difficult to understand as to how the court can brush aside the presumption under of the Prevention of Corruption Act of that Act it is proved that an accused has accepted or obtained or has agreed to accept or admitted to obtain for himself or for any other person any gratification other than legal remuneration or any valuable thing from any person it shall be presumed unless the contrary is proved that he accepted or obtained or agreed to accept or admitted to obtain that gratification or that valuable thing as a motive or reward such as is mentioned in or as the case may be without consideration or for a consideration which he knows to be inadequate When the <ORG> is called upon to consider whether a charge should be framed or not the question to which the <ORG> has to address itself is whether the evidence led on behalf of the prosecution is such that if unrebutted it would justify the conviction of the accused and the court has therefore to examine the evidence as it stands without rebuttal and come to a conclusion whether on the basis of such evidence the court would convict the accused and where the offence charged against the accused is under or or cl a or clause or sub or the court must necessarily apply the presumption under Therefore even for the purpose of considering whether a charge should be framed or not the presumption under A Sections and of the have been enacted by the <ORG> with a view to eradicating corruption in public life envisages is that any gratification other than legal remuneration should have been accepted or obtained or agreed to be accepted or attempted to be obtained by the accused for himself or for any other person as a motive or reward for doing or forbearing to do any official act or for showing or forbearing to show in the exercise of his official function favour or disfavour to any person or for rendering or attempting to render any service or disservice to any person while does not require taking of gratification as a motive or reward for any specific official action favour or service but strikes at obtaining by a public servant of any valuable thing without consideration or for a consideration which he knows to be inadequate from any person whom he knows to have been or to be or likely to be concerned in any proceeding or business transacted or about to be transacted by such public servant or having any connection with the official functions of himself or of any public servant to whom he is subordinate or from whom any person whom he knows to be interested in or related to the person so concerned Whereas under it is necessary to establish that the taking of gratification must be connected with any specific official action favour or service by way of motive or reward no such connection is necessary to be proved in order to bring home an offence under and all that is necessary to establish is that a valuable thing is accepted or obtained or agreed to be accepted or attempted to be obtained by a public servant from any person whom he knows to have been or to be likely to be concerned in any proceeding or business transacted or about to be transacted by such public servant or having any connection with the official function of such public servant and such valuable thing has been accepted or obtained without consideration or for a consideration which such public servant knows to be inadequate The following Judgments of the Court were delivered <NAME> <NAME> I agree with the judgment about to be delivered by my learned brother <NAME> but there are some two or three charges in regard to which I should like to make more detailed observations since they have not been dealt fully by my learned brother and he has left it to me to consider them in some detail Since the genesis of this appeal has been set out by my learned brother at length I do not propose to repeat what has been so ably said by him and I will confine myself only to the facts relating to the charges which are going to be dealt with by me But I may be permitted to say a few words in regard to two points which have been discussed by my learned brother in his judgment since they are of some importance and can without impropriety bear further discussion The first point arises out of a contention raised by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the first respondent hereinafter referred to as the respondent that the presumption under Section of the Prevention of Corruption Act applies only after a charge is framed against an accused and has no application at the stage when the court is considering the question whether a charge should be framed or not It is said in geometry that a point has position but no magnitude but we are constrained to observe that this point raised on behalf of the first respondent has not only no magnitude but has even no position It is wholly without substance and indeed it is surprising that it should have been raised by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the first respondent When the court is considering under Section sub section of the Code of Criminal Procedure whether any case has been made out against the accused which if unrebutted would warrant his conviction it is difficult to understand as to how the court can brush aside the presumption under Section of the Prevention of Corruption Act Sub section of Section of that Act provided that where in any trial of an offence punishable under Section or Section of the Indian Penal Code or of an offence referred to in clause a or clause of sub section of Section of that Act it is proved that an accused has accepted or obtained or has agreed to accept or admitted to obtain for himself or for any other person any gratification other than legal remuneration or any valuable thing from any person it shall be presumed unless the contrary is proved that he accepted or obtained or agreed to accept or submitted to obtain that gratification or that valuable thing as a motive or reward such as is mentioned in Section or as the case may be without consideration or for a consideration which he knows to be inadequate When the court is called upon to consider whether a charge should be framed or not the question to which the court has to address itself is whether the evidence led on behalf of the prosecution is such that if unrebutted it would justify the conviction of the accused and the <ORG> has therefore to examine the evidence as it stands without rebuttal and come to a conclusion whether on the basis of such evidence the court would convict the accused and where the offence charged against the accused is under Section or Section or clause a or clause of sub section of Section the <ORG> must necessarily apply the presumption under Section while considering whether on the basis of the unrebutted evidence which is before it the court would convict the accused We do not therefore see any substance in the contention raised on behalf of the first respondent and we must proceed to dispose of this appeal on the basis that even for the purpose of considering whether a charge should be framed or not the presumption under Section must be taken into account The second point on which considerable controversy was raised before us related to the scope and ambit of Section of the Indian Penal Code I agree with my learned brother that it may not be desirable at this stage to define the precise ambit and coverage of Section because that is a matter which will have to be considered by <ORG> in depth when the case goes back before <ORG> and the first respondent is called upon to face his trial on the charges framed against him It may be pointed out straight away that these two sections have been enacted by the <ORG> with a view to eradicating corruption in public life We may usefully quote here the following pertinent observations made by this Court in Re Special Courts Bill which came by way of Presidential Reference and which is reported in As I read it this measure is the embryonic expression of a necessitous legislative project which if full fledged will work a relentless break through towards catching through the compulsive criminal process the higher inhabitants of Indian public and political decks who have in practice remained untouchable and unapproachable to the rule of law The pathology of our public law with its class slant is that an unmincing ombudsman or sentinel on the qui vive with power to act against those in power now or before and offering legal access to the informed citizen to complain with immunity does not exist despite all the bruited umbrage of political performers against peculations and perversions by higher echelons The <ORG> must therefore interpret Section according to its plain language without in any manner being anxious or astute to narrow down its interpretation There are a few decisions of ancient vintage which have dealt with the interpretation of Section but since we are not finally laying down the true scope and ambit of Section we do not propose to discuss these decisions Suffice it to point out at the present stage that on its plain terms Section is wider than Section and that an act of corruption not falling within Section may yet come within the wide terms of Section What Section envisages is that any gratification other than legal remuneration should have been accepted or obtained or agreed to be accepted or attempted to be obtained by the accused for himself or for any other person as a motive or reward for doing or forbearing to do any official act or for showing or forbearing to show in the exercise of his official function favour or disfavour to any person or for rendering or attempting to render any service or disservice to any person while Section does not require taking of gratification as a motive or reward for any specific official action favour or service but strikes at obtaining by a public servant of any valuable thing without consideration or for a consideration which he knows to be inadequate from any person whom he knows to have been or to be or likely to be concerned in any proceeding or business transacted or about to be transacted by such public servant or having any connection with the official functions of himself or of any public servant to whom he is subordinate or from whom any person whom he knows to be interested in or related to the person so concerned Whereas under Section it is necessary to establish that the taking of gratification must be connected with any specific official action favour or service by way of motive or reward no such connection is necessary to be proved in order to bring whom an offence under Section and all that is necessary to establish is that a valuable thing is accepted or obtained or agreed to be accepted or attempted to be obtained by a public servant from any person whom he knows to have been or to be likely to be concerned in any proceeding or business transacted or about to be transacted by such public servant or having any connection with the official function of such public servant and such valuable thing has been accepted or obtained or agreed to be accepted or attempted to be obtained without consideration or for a consideration which such public servant knows to be inadequate Moreover it is clear from illustration to Section that money or currency is regarded by the <ORG> as a valuable thing and if it is accepted or obtained by a public servant without consideration or for inadequate consideration in the circumstances set out in Section such public servant would be guilty of an offence under that Section Having said this much on the interpretation of Section we now proceed to examine the facts on the basis of which the High <ORG> has declined to frame certain charges against the first respondent The facts giving rise to these charges in so far as relevant may be briefly stated as follows There was a firm called <ORG> which was in possession of certain ground floor premises situate at Mahatma Gandhi Road Fort Bombay as a tenant There were various changes in the constitution on this firm from time to time but we are not concerned with these changes in the present appeal What is material to note is that at the relevant time this firm consisted of <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> his father and two other partners It seems that since this firm was incurring losses and was not in a position to make use of the premises for its own purposes and hence it decided to sub let the entire premises barring about sq The partners of this firm therefore made an application to the Controller of Accommodation on th January pointing out that <ORG> had approached them with a request to allow them to use the premises for the purpose of opening their branch office in Bombay and that it would be advantageous to the country to make it possible for the <ORG> to open a branch office and requesting the Controller of Accommodation to grant the necessary permission Though this application was dated th January it appears from the endorsement made on the application that it was received in the office of the Controller of Accommodation on th February Further inquiry was thereupon made for the purpose of determining whether there was a suppressed vacancy in respect of the premises and after such inquiry was completed a further noting was made on nd March recommending that in view of the facts set out in that noting it is for orders whether we may consider the request and grant the no objection certificate in this case <NAME> who was an Accommodation Officer made an endorsement on the foot of his further noting pointing out that according to the inquiry made by the office no vacancy had actually occurred at any time in the premises and there was accordingly no suppressed vacancy and moreover only a part of the premises was proposed to be sub let by the firm of <ORG> and hence the premises could not be requisitioned as a suppressed vacancy and consequently no objection certificate might be granted The date below the signature of the Additional Chief Secretary is a little doubtful but we can safely take it to be nd March since there is an endorsement at the bottom of the page showing that the file was received in the Secretariat of the Additional Chief Secretary on th March and obviously it must have gone to the Secretariat to the Chief Minister after making of the endorsement by the Additional Chief Secretary We shall revert to this endorsement of the first respondent a little later when we examine the arguments urged on behalf of the parties <NAME> therefore after consulting his partners went to the residence of the first respondent a day or two after he received the above information that the file had been forwarded to the first respondent <NAME> stated in his evidence that he told the first respondent about the application for permission made on behalf of the firm of <ORG> and requested the first respondent to sanction grant of no objection certificate stating that he and his father were partners in that firm The first respondent however asked <NAME> to make a handsome donation to <NAME> and when <NAME> asked the first respondent as to how much he would like them to donate the first respondent asked <NAME> to donate Rs <NAME> thereupon pointed out to the first respondent that there was a registered agreement between <ORG> and the Government of France whereunder the Government of France had permitted the State <ORG> of India to open its Branch at Paris and <ORG> had consequently permitted Indo Suez <ORG> to open its Branch at Bombay and he accordingly requested the first respondent to name a reasonable amount for donation <NAME> thereafter contacted <NAME> and other partners and told them that he had met the first respondent in connection with the grant of no objection certificate and the first respondent had demanded Rs <NAME> was at this stage in his evidence asked the following question by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant What did the accused tell you about the <ORG> and to this question the following answer was given by <NAME> The accused told me that the needful would be done in the matter <NAME> reiterated in cross examination by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the first respondent After I handed over the cheque the accused stated that he will do the needful in the matter On these facts the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant submitted that offences under Section of the Indian Penal Code and Section read with Section of the Prevention of Corruption Act were clearly made out on behalf of the prosecution so as to warrant the framing of charges for the said offences against the first respondent The order of grant of no objection certificate to the firm of <ORG> had according to the learned counsel for the first respondent already been made by the first respondent on th March and for this purpose he relied on the endorsement in red ink made by the first respondent in the file relating to the grant of no objection certificate at the bottom of the page containing the endorsement of Shri <NAME> The argument of the learned counsel for the first respondent was that if the order for grant of no objection certificate had already been made by the first respondent on th March there could possibly be no connection between the grant of no objection certificate and the donation of Rs We do not see any reason why for the purpose of considering whether a charge should be framed or not we should disbelieve the evidence of <NAME> and <NAME> What we have to consider is whether the evidence led on behalf of the complainant in regard to this transaction is such that if unrebutted that would warrant the conviction of the first respondent This is not the stage to come to any definite finding on this question because after the charges are framed evidence may have to be led on behalf of the prosecution for the purpose of establishing overwriting of the figure by the figure and the first respondent may also lead the evidence to show that there is no overwriting and the original figure always was But while we are considering the prima facie case made out against the first respondent we cannot help observing that it does appear from the original endorsement in red ink made by the first respondent at the bottom of the relevant page in the file Ex It is a little difficult to understand that if the first respondent made his endorsement in red ink sanctioning the grant of no objection certificate on th March the file should not have gone back to <NAME> until th April There is also one other endorsement at the bottom of the page Ex which says Secretary has seen it and it bears the date And if that be so it lends considerable support to the oral testimony of <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> clearly stated in his evidence that when he met the first respondent at his residence <NAME> on th or th April perhaps the date was th April the first respondent stated that since the premises were to be sub let to <ORG> there should be no difficulty in granting no objection certificate but he asked <NAME> to make a handsome donation to <NAME> Pratibha Pratishthan The context in which the demand for a handsome donation was made by the first respondent left <NAME> in no doubt that a handsome donation would have to be given by his firm in consideration of getting the no objection certificate lakhs and when <NAME> pointed out that <ORG> have permitted the <ORG> to open its branch in Bombay and the premises were being sub let to <ORG> and requested him to name a reasonable figure for the donation the first respondent considered the request of <NAME> sympathetically and asked him to donate Rs If the donation was being made voluntarily why should any request have been made by <NAME> to the first respondent to name a reasonable amount and where could be the question of such a request being considered sympathetically by the first respondent Moreover when <NAME> contacted <NAME> and his other parterns after this meeting with the first respondent he clearly told them that the first respondent had demanded Rs There is no reason to disbelieve the evidence given by <NAME> to this effect lakhs was made out and according to the evidence of <NAME> he went to the residence of the first respondent <NAME> on the same day namely April and handed over the cheque to the Secretary as directed by the first respondent It is significant to note that the Order sanctioning the grant of no objection certificate was made by the first respondent on the file on th April i on the same date on which the cheque for Rs What altruistic motive could have inspired them to have made such a handsome donation when they themselves were incurring losses Prima Facie the inference to be drawn from these circumstances is irresistible and unless the first respondent can rebut this evidence it is difficult to reject the contention of the prosecution that a prima facie case has been made out against the first respondent in respect of this transaction We are therefore of the view that a prima facie case was made out on behalf of the prosecution against the first respondent in respect of the transaction of no objection certificate and th th and th charges should have been framed against the first respondent That takes us to draft charges and arising out of the donations made by <ORG> <ORG> and <ORG> to <NAME> Pratibha Pratishthan It is necessary to state briefly the facts relating to this transaction in order to be able to decide whether a prima facie case has been made out on behalf of the prosecution against the respondent in regard to this transaction and evidence led on behalf of the prosecution is such that if unrebutted it would warrant the conviction of the respondent on these charges We will begin by first referring to the evidence of <NAME> and whilst we consider that evidence we shall refer to the various documents produced in the case In <NAME> entered the construction business and started a limited company called <ORG> We are not concerned with this company in the present appeal There were also two other concerns started by <NAME> in in course of the construction business but these are also not relevant for our purpose except that we may state the names of these two concerns namely <NAME> Constructions and <ORG> There was also a private limited company floated by <NAME> in the name of <NAME> Constructions Private Limited Since the concerns of <NAME> were starved of cement and they could not proceed with the construction works undertaken by them without cement they made applications to the respondent from time to time for allotment of quota of cement We have on record four applications dated th April one being Ex Subsequently on the same date as in the case of the other three concerns that is on rd July an order was made alloting metric tonns of cement to <NAME> Enterprises and delivery of metric tonns of cement was taken by this concern pursuant to the order of allotment It will thus be seen that in the case of these four concerns namely <NAME> Construction Private Limited <ORG> <ORG> and <NAME> Enterprises only metric tonns of cement could be obtained prior to th July and it was admitted by <NAME> in the course of his evidence that it was correct that till th June that he had not received more than metric tonns of cement against the four applications dated th April Exs It was only when as a result of further representations made to the respondent new orders of allotment were issued on rd July that some quantities of cement could be obtained by these four concerns of <NAME> We have already referred to the fact that <ORG> had undertaken construction work under the agreement with <ORG> <ORG> had also not been able to obtain any quantity of cement in respect of the other construction work undertaken by them at Villa Parle East despite the application dated th April made by them to the respondent The two applications were accordingly made to the respondent on th June one by <ORG> marked as Ex dated nd June was given to <NAME> alongwith the cheque dated th July for Rs in consideration of the grant of the two permits in favour of <ORG> and <ORG> the first respondent had committed offences under sections and of the Indian Penal Code sub sections and of section of the Prevention of Corruption Act It seems that <ORG> has started a new project at <ORG> in May and they needed cement for this project and they accordingly made an application dated th June Ex Now according to the evidence of <NAME> was at the relevant time Secretary <ORG> the respondent mentioned to him on th June that one <NAME> would be giving to him i to <NAME> on th June a set of applications for cement indicating the quantity to be sanctioned and that these proposals had his approval and therefore the <ORG> should take action on these cases and thereafter report to the first respondent for confirmation <NAME> thereupon made a note in the file on the same day i th June setting out the above facts and stating that necessary action may be taken and thereafter the papers may be submitted to <ORG> through Secy It was recorded there by <NAME> that he had also submitted a note separately to <ORG> for confirmation of the action being taken by the <ORG> A note addressed to the respondent was accordingly made by <NAME> simultaneously and it was in the following terms <NAME> may kindly recall that he had mentioned to me yesterday th June that <NAME> will be giving to me to day applications for cement indicating the quantity to be sanctioned<ORG> <NAME> observed that the cases had his approval and the <ORG><ORG> should take necessary action thereon and report to <NAME> for confirmation<ORG> In all there are applications and the total quantity to be sanctioned comes to metric tonns It is the evidence of <NAME> that the file containing this note was returned to him on the same day that is th June and when the file came back to him this note bore the signature of the respondent and the date in his hand writing and <NAME> thereupon noted on the reverse of the note Please keep with papers dealing with these cases and addressed this note to the Deputy Secretary It is not necessary for the purpose of deciding the present appeal to come to a definite finding on the question whether this endorsement was in fact made by the respondent on th June or it was subsequently interpolated by him But we are constrained to make some observations in regard to this endorsement since the learned Judge has adversely commented on <NAME> in regard to his role in this affair If the respondent had not mentioned to <NAME> that <NAME> would be giving him a set of applications for cement indicating the quantity to be sanctioned and that these proposals had his approval and therefore the <ORG> should take action on these cases and thereafter report to the first respondent for confirmation it is extremely difficult to believe that <NAME> would have made the note Ex Then again if no such instructions had been given to him by the first respondent is it possible that he would have prepared the note Ex If <NAME> had decided to allot metric conns of cement to different applicants on his own presumably with a view to obliging these applicants for consideration or even otherwise and to palm it off on the first respondent by falsely attributing the authority to do so to the first respondent it passes one comprehension as to why he should have on the same day submitted note Ex submitted by <NAME> to the respondent was wrong and the respondent had not given to <NAME> the instructions set out in that note would the respondent have rested content with merely making an endorsement at the foot of the note saying that he was surprised at such notings It is not necessary for the purpose of the present appeal to resolve this controversy raised on behalf of the prosecution and to come to a definite finding upon it But even on the material on record there is reason to believe that the three statements which accompanied the note Ex This was disputed on behalf of the respondent who contended that these two donations had been made by <NAME> Construction Private Limited and <ORG> voluntarily and they had nothing to do with the allotment of cement to the concerns of <NAME> Now there are certain salient features in regard to this transaction which in our opinion go to show prima facie that these two donations were connected with the allotment of cement to the concerns of <NAME> In the first place there is no reason why any of the concerns of <NAME> should have made such large donations to <NAME> It was admitted by <NAME> that none of his concerns had made any profit and in fact he conceded in evidence that the donations made by his two concerns to the <NAME> had no connection with the profits of the two concerns or of any of his other concerns respectively to <NAME> when they were not making any profits at all and they had not made any substantial donations to any other charities despite large and frequent demands on the <NAME> family When <NAME> was asked as to how it happened that he paid the two cheques of Rs When <NAME> was asked to explain how it was that for the permit of metric tonns that is bags he made a payment of Rs which worked out to Rs per bag and for the permit of metric tonns that is bags he made payment of Rs We therefore reach the conclusion that on the evidence led on behalf of the prosecution a prima facie case must be held to have been made out against the respondent in respect of the transaction of the donations of Rs It was provided that <ORG> will construct on the plot necessary buildings and structures for carrying out its performances including residential quarters for essential staff working in the <ORG> and for visiting artists and students provided the <ORG> would be at liberty to make available these facilities to outside parties at such compensation as it may deem fit so long as the income from the land and buildings was appropriated for the objects of the <ORG> and further a sum equal to of the net annual profits of the <ORG> was credited to <ORG> Subsequently with a view to enabling it to meet its operating expenses <ORG> made an application to <ORG> by its letter dated th March requesting the <ORG> for permission to utilise upto one fourth of the area granted to it for the purpose of putting up high grade shops and offices But to the great dismay and consternation of the Directors of <ORG> a Government resolution was passed an rd March providing that since two separate leases were given to <ORG> in respect of sq These developments which took place in jeopardized the very existence of <ORG> One <NAME> was at all material times Managing trustee of <ORG> and apart from him there were ten other trustees including <NAME> When <ORG> found itself in this difficult situation where it would be almost impossible for it to carry out its activities <NAME> addressed a letter dated st January to the then Chief Minister requesting him to permit <ORG> to construct a commercial building with a rentable area of sq Though <NAME> did not hold any official position in <ORG> he took an active part in the negotiations with the various officers of <ORG> in for the purpose of obtaining relaxation of the <ORG> notification dated th June and <ORG> resolution dated rd March so as to enable <ORG> to construct a commercial building of net rentable area of sq and the letter dated th July addressed by <NAME> to Minister <NAME> part of Ex When the respondent came to power as Chief Minister efforts were renewed on behalf of <ORG> to obtain the necessary relaxation which would enable it to put up a commercial complex which would generate sufficient income He was appointed by the respondent as Chairman of <ORG> to deal with the problem of slums and dilapidated houses and he was given an office in Mantralaya He was also appointed a trustee of <NAME> on th October He started negotiations with <ORG> in February March and put forward a scheme under which the entire plot of acres would be treated as covered by one lease so that the net rentable area available to <ORG> for building purposes would be determinable by applying to the I to the whole of the area of the plot instead of applying it separately to each of the two areas into which the plot was decided This note set out the scheme proposed by <NAME> but it did not make any mention of the donations to be made to <NAME> Some reliance was placed on behalf of the respondent on the fact that this note did not make any reference to donations to be made to <NAME> and it was sought to be argued that there was in fact no such talk prior to the date of this note But this argument is futile because <NAME> clearly admitted in his evidence that in February he had discussed this scheme with the respondent <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> and that he had made it clear to the respondent and these officers that the donee of the scheme was <NAME> was handed over by <NAME> to <NAME> on th March and following upon this note there was discussion between <NAME> and <NAME> in the presence of <NAME> on th March when the scheme put forward by <NAME> was discussed It was agreed between <NAME> on behalf of <ORG> and <NAME> on behalf of <ORG> that the entire plot of acres would be covered under one lease on condition that the mortgage in respect of th area of the plot is redeemed the commercial development of the plot would be confined to th area of the plot and full FSI at the rate of in respect of the entire area of the plot would be available to <ORG> and this would give almost sq It was also agreed that the condition providing for payment of of the net profit of the <ORG> to <ORG> would remain unchanged and so also would the provision that of the net income from the commercial complex should be paid by <ORG> to <ORG> The respondent approved and confirmed the agreement but it was made clear to <NAME> and it was agreed by him that the donations made to <NAME> would not be deductible as expenses of <ORG> while computing its net income The argument urged on behalf of the respondent which found favour with the learned Trial Judge was that when the respondent declined the request of <NAME> to permit deductibility of the donations made to <NAME> the entire scheme foundered and thereafter there was no question of making any donations to <NAME> In the first place there is a noting made by <NAME> in the Government file relating to <ORG> on th April part of Ex where it has been clearly recorded by him It needs to be recorded that in the meeting held first by <NAME> with <NAME> and latter when <NAME> and <NAME> explained the agreement reached to both on it was clearly stated and agreed that the payments to <NAME> would be after <ORG> net income was computed and were not to be considered as <ORG> expenses while computing net income This noting made at a time when no controversy had arisen at all must prima facie be accepted as correct <NAME> of course disputed that any such agreement was arrived at between him on the one hand and Gavai <NAME> and the respondent on the other but prima facie we are inclined to accept the testimony of <NAME> to this effect because we would prefer documentary evidence to oral evidence in case of conflict between the two There was no particular reason why the figure of Rs This cheque was sent to <ORG> on rd August and it was dated st September The only answer which <NAME> could give in explanation which is rather strange conduct was that <ORG> expected that sufficient funds would be deposited in its account by There is another circumstance which is of a baffling character indeed it defies any rational conduct and this circumstance is that the four cheques representing the aggregate donation of Rs <ORG> would then have to return the amount of the donation but if this amount was already spent by <ORG> for purchasing land for the purpose of building a hospital how would <ORG> be able to return the amount of the donation and even if the amount of the donation were returned it would be without interest because there was admittedly no provision for payment of interest and a <ORG> concern making the donation would lose interest on the amount of the donation for the period during which the amount remained with <ORG> Obviously and here again we are expressing our prima facie view this donation of Rs It appears that since the Government of Maharashtra was not agreeable to override <ORG> notification restricting FSI to as also to permit the donations to <NAME> to be deducted in computing the income of <ORG> <NAME> informed <NAME> as stated by him in paragraph of his deposition that his scheme was not acceptable to the Government and that <NAME> should therefore move in the matter <NAME> accordingly addressed a letter dated st April Ex Neither <NAME> and <NAME> nor the respondent therefore accepted this suggestion of <NAME> This note which is dated th April and which is part of Ex It was stated in this note that <ORG> had requested that these donations may be considered as expenses of <ORG> while computing its net income Obviously reference was made by <NAME> in this note to the request made by <ORG> in the letter of <NAME> dated st April Ex It was when this note of <NAME> came to <NAME> that he recorded the note dated th April marked to which we have referred in some detail The draft Government resolution for giving effect to the <ORG> decision of th April was approved by the Chief Secretary and the Government resolution dated th May was issued by the Government of Maharashtra directing that i The entire plot of land admeasuring sq There was also one other trust floated by the respondent namely <ORG> These four trusts were drafted by <NAME> PW and in all these four trusts the respondent his wife and <NAME> were the only trustees and it was provided in each of these four trusts that any vacancy arising the office of trustee would be filled up from the family of the respondent He went on to say that the respondent had sent to him one <NAME> who was a labour leader in <ORG> in Bombay and he heard from <NAME> that <ORG> intended to make donations before st March lakhs to <NAME> and cheques were paid to <NAME> on behalf of these three trusts lakhs were also connected with the negotiations which took place on th March between <NAME> on the one hand and <NAME> and the respondent on the other The learned Trial Judge in our opinion fell into an error in discharging the respondent in respect of these charges Before we close we may make it clear that we have examined the evidence on record merely for the purpose of deciding whether the evidence is of such a nature that if unrebutted it would warrant the conviction of the respondent It will be open to the respondent to rebut this evidence and to make out his defence when the trial proceeds against him on the charges already framed by the learned Trial Judge and the additional charges which we have directed to be framed against him RANGANATH MISRA This appeal by special leave is directed against the order of a learned Single Judge of <ORG> dated April refusing to frame charges on heads while framing charges under other heads This litigation has had a chequered career The appellant <NAME> filed a petition of complaint on September in <ORG> Esplanade Bombay alleging commission of several offences by the respondent and some other persons and Section of the Prevention of Corruption Act II of Act for short without appropriate sanction as the respondent was at the relevant time holding the office of Chief Minister of the State of Maharashtra This complaint came to be registered as Special Case No This Court directed Therefore Special Case No and Special Case No held When cognizance is taken on a private complaint or to be precise otherwise than on a police report the Special Judge has to try the case according to the procedure prescribed for trial of warrant cases instituted otherwise than on police report by a Magistrate sections to of Code of Criminal Procedure Section requires that when accused is brought before a <ORG> the <ORG> shall proceed to hear the complainant and take all such evidence as may be produced in support of the prosecution Accused has a right to cross examine complainant and his witnesses If upon considering the evidence so produced the <ORG> finds that no case against the accused has been made out which if unrebutted would warrant his conviction the <ORG> shall discharge the accused section ibid If on the other hand <ORG> is of the opinion that there is ground for presuming that the accused has committed an offence which the <ORG> is competent to try a charge shall be framed in writing against the accused By the impugned order the learned Trial Judge framed charges and refused to frame the remaining charges proposed by the prosecution and made an order of discharge in respect of those charges He alleged in the petition of complaint that between August and September when respondent was functioning as Chief Minister he retained to himself the power to deal with the following matters The allotment of cement quota and distribution of cement Supply and sale of industrial alcohol issue of licenses for wholesalers and retailers dealing in country liquor and Indian made foreign liquor Control of co operatives and in particular the sugar co operatives Administration of urban land ceiling law restriction of I and exemptions therefrom and in fact he himself exercised these powers of the <ORG> <NAME> AP It is the prosecution case and there is no dispute that Srivardhan located in the District of Raigad was the Assembly Constituency of the respondent These representations were made with a view to creating an appropriate impact on the mind of the people at large The prosecution examined specific witnesses with reference to the allegations supporting the draft charges The learned Trial Judge who was required in law to state the reasons if he discharged the accused in an unusually long order extracted the evidence of witnesses at length as also the contents of the documents and framed charges while discharging the respondent in respect of the remaining The learned Trial Judge framed charges in respect of six transactions relating to cement and one relating to industrial alcohol for offences under ss and IPC and read with of the Act Section provides If upon taking of the evidence referred to in the Magistrate considers for reasons to be recovered that no case against the accused has been made out which if unrebutted would warrant his conviction the Magistrate shall discharge him While section on the other hand requires If when such evidence has been taken or at any previous stage of the case the Magistrate is of opinion that there is ground for presuming that the accused has committed an offence triable under this Chapter which such Magistrate is competent to try and which in his opinion should be adequately punished by him he shall frame in writing a charge against the accused The Code contemplates discharge of the accused by <ORG> under in a case triable by it cases instituted upon a police report are covered by and cases instituted otherwise than on police report are dealt with in The three sections contain some what different provisions in regard to discharge of the accused Under the trial Judge is required to discharge the accused if he considers that there is not sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused The power to discharge is exercisable under when the Magistrate considers for reasons to be recorded that no case against the accused has been made out which if unrebutted would warrant his conviction It is a fact that ss and provide for discharge being ordered before the recording of evidence and the consideration as to whether charge has to be framed or not is required to be made on the basis of the record of the case including documents and oral hearing of the accused and the prosecution or the police report the documents sent along with it and examination of the accused and after affording an opportunity to the two parties to be heard Not withstanding this difference in the position there is no scope for doubt that the stage at which the Magistrate is required to consider the question of framing of charge under is a preliminary one and the test of prima facie case has to be applied A I this Court in case instituted on complaint applied the prima facie test It was further observed If the evidence which the prosecution proposes to adduce to prove the guilt of the accused even if fully accepted before it is challenged in cross examination or rebutted by the defence evidence if any cannot show that the accused committed the offence then there will be no sufficient ground for proceeding with the trial An exhaustive list of circumstances to indicate as to what will lead to one conclusion or the other is neither possible nor advisable We may just illustrate the difference of the law by one more example But if on the other hand it is so at the initial stage of making an order under or then in such a situation ordinarily and generally the order which will have to be made will be one under charge to be framed and not under of discharge a decision to which the trial <ORG> referred this <ORG> was dealing with a case involving allegations relating to offences punishable under read with of the Act and IPC as here <NAME> indicated that the <ORG> has power to sift and weigh the evidence for the limited purpose of finding out whether or not a prima facie case against the accused has been made out The standard of test proof and judgment which is to be applied finally before finding the accused guilty or otherwise is not exactly to be applied At this stage even a very strong suspicion founded upon materials before the Magistrate which leads him to form a presumptive opinion as to the existence of the factual ingredients constituting the offence alleged may justify the framing of charge The use of the words if upon taking of the evidence referred to in in sub of is suggestive of the statutory intention that until all such evidence as may be produced in support of the prosecution is taken the stage for judicial consideration as to whether charge is to be framed is not reached Admittedly the witnesses examined for the prosecution have been cross examined and in the case of some at great length There is no scope for doubt that the rebuttal case envisaged in of the Code is fairly clear from the cross examination of prosecution witnesses as also from the documents exhibited before the <ORG> apart from direct evidence being led by the defence independently Under the scheme of the Code there is no scope for the accused to lead defence evidence until the prosecution is closed and the examination of the accused under of the Code is over Lengthy arguments were advanced both by Mr <NAME> for the appellant and Mr <NAME> for the respondent with reference to the evidence When an attempt was made by learned counsel on both sides to present an analysis of the evidence and criticism was advanced by Mr <NAME> against the reasons given by the trial Judge and support was indicated by Mr <NAME> to such reasons we indicated to Mr <NAME> that if we went into the matter at length even for the prima facie purpose and indicated conclusions it might embarrass the respondent in his defence even in respect of the charges framed by <ORG> In view of these observations made in course of the hearing a written statement on behalf of the respondent was filed on November signed by the respondent and his counsel The relevant portion of the said statement reads thus Since some charges have already been framed by learned Trial Judge with respect to offences under ss and I On which there is not much of case law and it involves appreciation of the scheme of the relevant provisions of the I as well as of the Prevention of Corruption Act the respondent is willing to face trial straightaway in respect of A not only the charges already framed but also on the draft charges in so far as they involved the offences alleged under ss and I It was further pointed out that a direction to frame charges on the basis of the statement filed has to be on the footing that the prosecution evidence in support of the charges was such that unless rebutted the respondent would liable to be convicted But it cannot be disputed that in order to decide whether the order of discharge should be sustained or set aside we have to consider whether on the material on record a prima facie case has been made out on behalf of the prosecution pointed out on more than one occasion that the respondent might be prejudiced in his defence if while laying down the parametres of that offence we indicated a straightjacket formula He also suggested that the matter should be left to be argued and the learned Trial Judge should be free to come to his conclusion in law with reference to the facts of the case about the scope and ambit of that provision that if any party was aggrieved by the decision it would still be open to be corrected in the appellate forum But before doing so we would briefly refer to the evidence in support of the charges which the respondent has agreed to be framed for the purpose of showing that the learned Trial Judge had prima facie taken a wrong view and it was a fit case where these charges should have also been framed <NAME> a <ORG> colleague of the respondent and now a sitting Member of <ORG> who has close association with one of the major sugar co operatives as also Directors of the other sugar co operatives has spoken about the demand of contribution and the raising of contribution taking a bag of sugar produced as the unit There is considerable evidence in regard to allotment of cement under instructions of the respondent In regard to the <ORG> there is contemporaneous documentary evidence as also oral evidence to show that certain concessions were extended by <ORG> and payments had been received which have gone into the Trust funds While the prosecution has alleged that the payments of money were a consideration for the favour shown to <ORG> the defence has A come out with the version that the payments made and stipulated were unconnected and the large sum of money agreed to be paid was for the purpose of improving the lot of the people of Konkan region Similarly in regard to the grant of No Objection Certificate in respect of the premises of <ORG> there is evidence from the side of the prosecution to support its allegation that the power of the <ORG> was exercised for a consideration while there is no denial regarding receipt of the payment but the link is denied and disputed Similarly in regard to industrial alcohol at least so far as <ORG> are concerned there is the evidence of PW The learned Trial Judge as already pointed out extracted at great length both the oral evidence as also the contents of documents but there was not much of analysis to justify rejection of the material It may be pointed out that there is substance in Mr <NAME> submission that the learned Trial Judge adopted two different standards in the matter of weighing the same evidence when he agreed to frame charges which were inter linked and inter connected with the rest of the prosecution story with reference to which the draft charges had been given We are in the circumstances inclined to take the view that the statement filed by the respondent was justified and the order of discharge made by the learned trial Judge is not sustainable It is appropriate at this stage to take note of the fact that under of the Code the requirement is that the evidence must be such which if not rebutted would warrant conviction of the accused There is another aspect which has also to be noticed here Section of that Act provides Where in any trial of an offence punishable under or section of the Indian Penal Code or of an offence referred to in clause a or clause of sub of of this Act punishable under sub section thereof it is proved that an accused person has accepted or obtained or has agreed to accept or attempted to obtain for himself or for any other person any gratification other than legal remuneration or any valuable thing from any person it shall be presumed unless the contrary is proved that he accepted or obtained or agreed to accept or attempted to obtain that gratification or that valuable thing as the case may be as a motive or reward such as is mentioned in the said section or as the case may be without consideration or for a consideration which he knows to be inadequate The main ingredients of the charge under IPC are that the accused was a public servant that he must be shown to have obtained from any person any gratification other than legal remuneration and that the gratification should be as a motive or reward for doing or forbearing to do any official act or for showing or forbearing to show in the exercise of his official function favour or disfavour to any person Ordinarily when the first two ingredients are established by evidence a rebuttable presumption arises in respect of the third For the offence under IPC the essential ingredients are i the accused was a public servant ii he accepted or obtained or agreed to accept or obtain a valuable thing without consideration or for an inadequate consideration knowing it to be inadequate iii the person giving the thing must be a person concerned or interested in or related to the person concerned in any proceeding or business transacted or about to be transacted by the government servant or having any connection with the official of him self or of any public servant to whom he is subordinate and iv the accused must have knowledge that the person giving the thing is so concerned or interested or related It has been pointed out by this <ORG> in <NAME> case <ORG> that is so worded as to cover cases of corruption which do not come within ss or The difference between the acceptance of a bribe made punishable under and IPC is this under the former section the present is taken as a motive or reward for abuse of office under the latter section the question of motive or reward is wholly immaterial and the acceptance of a valuable thing without consideration or with inadequate consideration from a person who has or is likely to have any business to be transacted is forbidden because though not taken as a motive or reward for showing any official favour it is likely to influence the public servant to show official favour to the person giving such valuable thing According to the learned counsel the learned Judge fell into an error in confining his consideration of the issue by referring to the deposition of PW Mr <NAME> next contended that the following features which had been established should have led the learned Judge to hold that there was material for the view that a case in respect of the charge had been made out by the prosecution crores for the <ORG> out of which a moiety was to be raised during the crushing season of and the remainder during the following season ii The IGPP between the date of its formation and had been able to secure a very small amount compared to the target and bulk of that small amount had come from <ORG> iii Considering the pomp and publicity with which <ORG> had been brought into existence the financial position appeared to be ridiculous for want of sufficient funds The fact that <ORG> had issued a cheque of Rs Before a person can be said to put any person to fear of any injury to that person it must appear that he has held out some threat to do or omit to do what he is legally bound to do in future If all that a man does is to promise to do a thing which he is not legally bound to do and says that if money is not paid to him he would not do that thing such act would not amount to an offence of extortion We agree with this view which has been indicated in <NAME> King Emperor A I All There is no evidence at all in this case that the managements of the sugar co operatives had been put in any fear and the contributions had been paid in response to threats The evidence led by the prosecution falls short of the requirements of law in regard to the alleged offence of extortion We see therefore no justification in the claim of Mr <NAME> that a charge for the offence of extortion should have been framed The only other allegation in respect of which there is an order of discharge is relating to cheating In the petition of complaint detailed factual allegations were made in paragraphs to in regard to this aspect The <ORG> met on October and it is the prosecution case that the respondent gave out a Press Conference on the following day that on the th October the <ORG> had decided to create a <ORG> by the name of <ORG> That was shown to <NAME> the Secretary of the <ORG> and on reading the Report he admitted it to be more or less correct Therein there is reference to <ORG> and a reading of it prima facie shows that the establishment of <ORG> was the decision of <ORG> It is true that he has taken the stand that there is no ministerial approval at the pre publication stage of the contents Similarly there is another <ORG> of Maharashtra publication known as Maharashtra Marches Ahead Ext and it clearly shows that it is not a <ORG> <ORG> nor was it created by the <ORG> <NAME> was specifically questioned as to whether there was a <ORG> decision in respect of creation of <ORG> as a Govt So far as the second aspect i relating to the association of the name of Mrs <NAME> is concerned Mr <NAME> for the respondent has admitted the position that Mrs <NAME> had at no stage given her consent to her name being associated with <NAME> Respondent made a similar statement on the floor of <ORG> on September wherein apart from endorsing the statement in <ORG> he took the responsibility on himself of assuming Mrs <NAME> consent He ultimately took the view that the material placed on record did not justify a charge under We are afraid that if we follow that procedure and express our opinion one way or the other with reference to each item of evidence either party is likely to be prejudiced when the matter goes for trial notwithstanding our statement that we were doing so only for the purpose of finding out whether a prima facie case had been made out of the IPC and the ingredients for that offence are i there should be fraudulent or dishonest inducement of a person by deceiving him ii a the person so induced should be intentionally induced to deliver any property to any person or to consent that any person shall retain any property or the person so induced should be intentionally induced to do or to omit to do anything which he would not do or omit if he were not so deceived and iii in cases covered by the second part of ii the act or omission should be one which caused or is likely to cause damage or harm to the person induced in body mind reputation or property Section actually consists of two parts each part dealing with one way of cheating Where by deception practised upon a person the accused dishonestly or fraudulently induces that person to deliver property to any person or to consent that any person shall retain any property We are therefore of the view that a charge under IPC should be framed by the learned trial Judge against the respondent So far as the three draft charges relating to the offence punishable under IPC are concerned we agree with the learned trial Judge that the prosecution failed to make out a prima facie case The appeal is allowed to that extent A names of others were not disclosed and a prayer was made that all other officers who were involved in the matter may be proceeded against These are relevant aspects to be taken into consideration We agree with Mr <NAME> submission that the superior direction is no defence in respect of criminal acts as every officer is bound to act according to law and is not entitled to protection of a superior direction as a defence in the matter of commission of a crime There was therefore no question of discharging them It is in the discretion of the trial <ORG> to take a decision as to whether keeping all aspects in view any other person should be brought in as an accused to be tried for any of the offences involved in the case We do not express any definite view in this regard and we consider it sufficient to indicate that this is a matter in the discretion of the trial court There is one other aspect which required to be dealt with We have no intention to make anything final at this stage except that the prosecution for the offence under Any observation made by us in any part of our Judgment is confined to the question as to whether charges should be framed and or the order of discharge should be upheld The learned trial Judge is therefore free to come to his own conclusions on the basis of the evidence which is already on record and which may be led before him by the parties when the trial proceeds after the framing of the charges and he will decide whether the charges against the st respondent are made out or not on the basis of the entire evidence At the hearing Mr <NAME> for the appellant had prayed that we should give a direction to the learned Chief Justice to nominate a Judge other than <NAME> <NAME> to take up A the further trial of the case and this prayer has been opposed by Mr <NAME> for the respondent We have no doubt that <NAME> <NAME> had dealt with the matter in a fair way and there is no warrant on the facts of the case for shifting the case from him to another learned Judge for trial Though we have no doubt in our mind that <NAME> <NAME> acted fairly and impartially in disposing of the case in the manner he did it cannot be said that there is no scope for apprehension in the appellant mind that his complaint may not receive adequate and proper treatment at the hands of the same learned Judge who has already expressed himself one way In these circumstances while reiterating our opinion that we have no doubt that <NAME> <NAME> acted fairly and impartially and without casting any reflection whatsoever on the learned Judge we would following the well known dictum that justice should not only be done but must also appear to be done request the learned Chief Justice of the High <ORG> to nominate another learned Judge to take up the matter from the stage at which <NAME> <NAME> made the impugned order A Appeal allowed in part
