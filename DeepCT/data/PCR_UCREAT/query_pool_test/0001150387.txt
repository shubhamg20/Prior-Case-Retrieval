The arbitrator gave a non speaking award in favour of the re spondent amounting to a consolidated sum of Rs lakhs The petitioner preferred an application for setting aside the award which was dis missed The High <ORG> dismissed the appeal and the revision of the petitioner Before this <ORG> it was contended inter alia that the award purported to grant damages on the basis of escalation of cost and prices and such escalation was not a matter within the domain of the bargain between the parties It was also contended that the fact that the arbitrator had taken into consideration the question of escalation would make the award bad because it was not discernible whether he had awarded any amount on account of excalation Dismissing the special leave petition this <ORG> HELD In matters of challenging an award there are often two distinct and different grounds One is an error apparent on the face of the record and the other is that the arbitrator has exceeded his jurisdiction Only in a speaking award the court can look into the reasoning of the award It is not open to the court to probe the mental process of the arbitrator and speculate where no reasons are given by the arbitrator as to what impelled the arbitrator to arrive at his conclusion It is not discernible on the face of the record that the arbitrator has exceeded his jurisdiction in awarding damages on account of escalation All that the award states is that he has considered the claim on the basis of escala tion A The Arbitrator does not state that he has awarded any amount on that account There is neither any error apparent on the face of the record nor any material to satisfy that the arbitrator has exceeded his jurisdiction in awarding the amount as he did The respondent <NAME> was at all material times a Class I contractor who had entered into an agreement with <ORG> for formation of earth dam in gorge portion from chainage to of Raiwada Reservoir Project near Devarapalli village Chodavaram Taluk Distt Disputes and differences arose between the parties in respect of the aforesaid agreement A reference was made to the arbitrator as per the arbitrator clause in the agreement between the parties The respondent made eleven claims claiming various amounts particulars whereof have been set out by the arbitrator as follows The arbitrator gave a non speaking award dated th July in favour of the respondent amounting to Rs lakhs wherein he stated as follows Claim II has been withdrawn by the petitioner himself on the ground it was subsequently refunded by the respondents On the balance claims I and III the arbitrator had awarded a consolidated amount of Rs lakhs to the extent of the claims judged admissible The respondent filed a proceeding before the <ORG> to make the award rule of the <ORG> The petitioner preferred an appeal and a civil review petition before the High <ORG> of Hydera bad The main contention which was sought to be urged on this case was that the award was a nonspeaking award and as such was bad This <ORG> further directed on th December that the entire amount of award if not deposited in the trial court should be deposited in the trial court within two months from that date and upon the deposit being made the respondent will be at liberty to withdraw of the amount which has not been withdrawn on furnishing security to the satisfaction of the trial court It was then contended that the award has pur ported to grant damages on the basis of escalation of cost and prices and such escalation was not a matter within the doman of the bargain between the parties and having taken that factor into consideration the award was bad We have set out the relevant portion of the award From reading the award as set out hereinbefore it is clear that the arbi trator has considered the claim made on the basis of esca lation and damages but he has awarded a total sum of Rs lakhs insofar as he finds admissible in respect of the claims which the arbitrator has adjudged In such a situation it is not possible to contend that there was any exercise of jurisdiction by the arbitrator beyond his competence It is well settled that in matter of challenging the award there are often two distinct and different grounds One is an error apparent on the face of the record and the other is that the arbitrator has exceeded his jurisdiction An award may be remitted or set aside on the ground that the arbitrator in making it had exceeded his jurisdiction and evidence of matters not appearing on the face of it will be admitted in order to establish whether the jurisdiction had been exceed ed or not because the nature of the dispute is something which has to be determined outside the award whatever might be said about it in the award or by the arbitrator Only in a speaking award the court can look into the reasoning of the award It is not open to the court to probe the mental process of the arbitrator and speculate where no reasons are given by the arbitrator as to what impelled the arbitrator to arrive at his conclusion In these circumstances in our opinion on the basis of well settled principles of law such an award especially in view of the fact that excluding item No III the remaining items would also be well over Rs lakhs it is not discernible on the face of the record that arbitrator has exceeded his jurisdiction in awarding damages on account of escalation of charges and expenses which were beyond the arbitration ambit The fact that the arbitrator has considered the claim made by the respondent on account of escalation does not make per se the award to be bad Mr <NAME> learned counsel appearing for the appellant contended that the fact that the arbitrator has taken into consideration the question of escalation would make the award bad because it is not discernible whether he has awarded any amount on account of escalation In case of an error apparent on the face of the record it has to be established that an item or an amount which the arbitrator had no jurisdiction to take into consideration has been awarded or granted All that the award states is that he has considered the claim on the basis of escalation The award does not state that he has awarded any amount on that account There is neither any error apparent on the face of the record nor any material to satisfy that the arbitrator has exceeded his jurisdiction in awarding the amount as he did
