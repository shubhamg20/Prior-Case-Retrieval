Defendants in No of on the file of the Subordinate Judge Cuddalore aggrieved by the order dated in I A No of in the said suit has filed the above revision under Article of the Constitution of India Plaintiffs respondents herein filed the said suit No of before <ORG> Cuddalore against the defendants petitioners herein for declaration declaring that <ORG> Cuddalore is an independent entity outside the control of <ORG> and that the suit property belongs absolutely to <ORG> and restraining the defendants their men agents or any person claiming under them by a decree of permanent injunction from in any manner interfering with the plaintiffs possession and enjoyment of the suit property and their right to administer the affairs of <ORG> Pending suit the plaintiffs filed I A No of under Order Rules and and Section of the Code of Civil Procedure praying for an order of interim injunction restraining the second respondent therein from acting as Pastor Presbyter of <ORG> and the first respondent from appointing any other person as Pastor Presbyter of <ORG> The learned Subordinate Judge by an order dated after hearing the arguments of the petitioners side and perusing the records and after holding that they made out a prima facie case granted ad interim injunction against the second respondent therein till and ordered Notice to the respondents Against the said order the respondents in that application preferred the present revision under Article of the Constitution of India Mr <NAME> learned counsel appearing for the petitioners after drawing my attention to the relevant provisions namely Order Rules and of the Code of Civil Procedure and by pointing out that inasmuch as the learned Subordinate Judge has not recorded any reason for the grant of interim order the same is violative of the provisions of Order Rule and not sustainable On the other hand Mr <NAME> learned counsel appearing for the respondents vehemently contended that the present revision under Article of the Constitution of India is not maintainable since the petitioners herein have effective remedy either by filing a petition for vacation of the injunction or filing an appeal before the appellate court accordingly prayed for dismissal of the revision petition I have carefully considered the rival submissions Where in any suit it is proved by affidavit or otherwise a that any property in dispute in a suit is in danger of being wasted damaged or alienated by any party to the suit or wrongfully sold in execution of a decree or that the defendant threatens or intends to remove or dispose of his property with a view to defrauding his creditors that the defendant threatens to dispossess the plaintiffs or otherwise cause injury to the plaintiff in relation to any property in dispute in the suit the Court may by order grant a temporary injunction to restrain such act or make such other order for the purpose of staying and preventing the wasting damaging alienation sale removal or disposition of the property or dispossession of the plaintiff or otherwise causing injury to the plaintiff in relation to any property in dispute in the suit as the Court thinks fit until disposal of the suit or until further orders The <ORG> shall in all cases except where it appears that the object of granting the injunction would be defeated by the delay before granting an injunction direct notice of the application for the same to be given to the opposite party Provided that where it is proposed to grant an injunction without giving notice of the application to the opposite party the court shall record the reasons for its opinion that the object or granting the injunction would be defeated by delay and require the applicant a to deliver to the opposite party or to send to him by registered post immediately after the order granting the injunction has been made a copy of the application for injunction together with i a copy of the affidavit filed in support of the application ii a copy of the plaint and iii copies of documents on which the applicant relies and to file on the day on which such injunction is granted or on the day immediately following that day an affidavit stating that the copies aforesaid have been so delivered or sent Each <ORG> consists of several units called <ORG>s Though several civil and revenue proceedings had taken place it is suffice to refer the filing of the suit namely No of by the respondents herein before <ORG> Cuddalore In that suit they prayed for a declaration declaring that <ORG> Cuddalore is an independent entity outside the control of <ORG> declaring that the suit property belongs absolutely to <ORG> and restraining the defendants their men agents or any person claiming under them by a decree of permanent injunction from in any manner interfering with the plaintiffs possession and enjoyment of the suit property and their right to administer the affairs of <ORG> The plaintiffs also filed I A No of under Order Rules and and Section of the Code of Civil Procedure praying for an order of injunction against the nd respondent therein from acting as Pastor Presbyter of <ORG> and from appointing any other person as Pastor Presbyter of <ORG> pending suit Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the petitioners herein by drawing my attention to Order Rules and vehemently contended that in the absence of recording the reasons for granting ad interim injunction before hearing the other side the interim order passed by the learned Subordinate Judge cannot be sustained He also contended that the plaintiffs have not enclosed any document either along with the plaint or with the injunction application hence there is no question of perusing the records as stated by the learned Subordinate Judge Any party who files a suit for necessary relief is also entitled for a temporary injunction under Order Rule The said application must be supported by affidavit stating that the property in dispute in a suit is in danger of being wasted damaged or alienated by any party to the suit or wrongfully sold in execution of a decree or that the other party threatens or intends to remove or dispose of his property with a view to defraud In other words if there is sufficient materials and apprehension to show that the defendant is likely to waste damage alienate sell or dispossess the property in dispute or otherwise cause injury to the plaintiff in relation to the property in dispute in the suit he can ask for a temporary injunction either until the disposal of the suit or until further orders Like wise in a suit for restraining the defendant from committing a breach of contract or other injury the plaintiff may at any time during the pendency of the suit apply to the <ORG> for temporary injunction to restrain the defendant from committing the breach of contract or injury complained of In all these cases the <ORG> may by order grant injunction on such terms as to the duration of the injunction The power granted under Rules and of Order is subject to the conditions prescribed in Rule However if it appears to the <ORG> that the object of granting injunction would be defeated by delay the <ORG> shall before granting an injunction direct notice of the application for the same to be given to the opposite party The <ORG> can grant injunction without giving notice of the application to the opposite party by recording the reasons for its opinion and also require the applicant to fulfill the conditions stipulated in Clauses a i ii and iii and of Rule He also stated that there is a prima facie case A perusal of the copy of the plaint filed in the typed set of papers as well as the certified copy of the plaint produced at the time of hearing shows that the plaintiffs have not produced documents along with the plaint Order Rule insists that plaintiff shall endorse on the plaint or annex thereto a list of the documents if any which he has produced along with it and if the plaint is admitted he has to present within such time as may be fixed by the <ORG> or extended by it from time to time as many copies for the service of the defendants Mr <NAME> learned counsel appearing for the respondents fairly admitted that the plaint did not contain documents Absolutely there is no reference regarding details of those documents whether they were filed along with the petition or placed at the time of hearing of the injunction application In other words except the oral statement of Mr <NAME> absolutely there is no iota of evidence to show that the documents have been filed either along with the plaint or in the injunction application In such a circumstance as rightly contended by Mr <NAME> except the averments in the affidavit and plaint no documents have been placed before the <ORG> accordingly the statement of the learned Subordinate Judge that he perused the records cannot be sustained This question was elaborately considered in para of their judgment This Court had occasion to emphasise the need to give reasons before passing ex parte orders of injunction In this background the requirement for recording the reasons for grant of ex parte injunction cannot be held to be a mere formality This requirement is consistent with the principle that a party to a suit who is being restrained from exercising a right which such party claims to exercise either under a statute or under the common law must be informed why instead of following the requirement of Rule the procedure prescribed under the proviso has been followed The party which invokes the jurisdiction of the court for grant of an order of restrain against a party without affording an opportunity to him of being heard must satisfy the court about the gravity of the situation and court has to consider briefly these factors in the ex parte order We are quite conscious of the fact that there are other statutes which contain similar provisions requiring the court or the authority concerned to record reasons before exercising power vested in them In respect of some of such provisions it has been held that they are required to be complied with but non compliance therewith will not vitiate the order so passed But same cannot be said in respect of the proviso to Rule of Order Such ex parte orders have far reaching effect as such a condition has been imposed that court must record reasons before passing such order Proviso to Rule of Order of the Code attracts the principle that if a statute requires a thing to be done in a particular manner it should be done in that manner or not at all As such whenever a court considers it necessary in the facts and circumstances of a particular case to pass an order of injunction without notice to other side it must record the reasons for doing so and should take into consideration while passing an order of injunction all relevant factors including as to how the object of granting injunction itself shall be defeated if an ex parte order is not passed After saying so and after considering the merits of the case before them Their Lordships have concluded that para As to why the respondent chose to come at the eleventh hour and where was the need to pass an urgent order of injunction are mailers which are not discernible Besides tested in the light of the case law set out above the impugned order which is bereft of reason and laconic cannot stand a moment scrutiny It has been pointed out repeatedly that a party is not entitled to an order of injunction as a matter of right or course Grant of injunction is within the discretion of the court and such discretion is to be exercised in favour of the plaintiff only if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that unless the defendant is restrained by an order of injunction an irreparable loss or damage will be caused to the plaintiff during the pendency of the suit The court grants such relief according to the legal principles ex debito justitiae Before any such order is passed the court must be satisfied that a strong prima facie case has been made out by the plaintiff including on the question of maintainability of the suit and the balance of convenience is in his favour and refusal of injunction would cause irreparable injury to him It is clear from Rule that whenever the <ORG> intends to grant ex parte injunction without notice to the opposite part the <ORG> shall record its reason reasons for its opinion that the object of granting the injunction would be defeated by the delay and also require the applicant to fulfil the conditions stipulated in Clause a and therein Though the learned Subordinate Judge has stated that he heard the arguments of the petitioners side perused the records and found that a prima facie case is made out in favour of the petitioners first of all there is no question of perusing the records in the absence of any documents filed either along with the plaint or with the injunction application As a matter of fact the courts have taken a view that apart from arriving at a conclusion that a prima facie case is made out in certain matters the court has to satisfy the maintainability of the suit etc It is to be noted that grant of injunction is an extraordinary power vested in the <ORG> to be exercised taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of a particular case The <ORG>s have to be more cautious that when the said power is being exercised without notice or hearing the party who is to be affected by the order so passed That is why Rule of Order of the Code requires that in all cases the court shall before grant of an injunction direct notice of the application to be given to the opposite party except where it appears that object of granting injunction itself would be defeated by delay By the Civil Procedure Code Amendment Act a proviso has been added to the said rule saying that where it is proposed to grant an injunction without giving notice of the application to the opposite party the court shall record the reasons for its opinion that the object of granting the injunction would be defeated by delay When the statute itself requires reasons to be recorded the <ORG> cannot ignore the requirements is that the court shall record the reasons why an ex parte order of injunction was being passed in the facts and circumstances of a particular case In this background the requirement for recording the reasons for grant of ex parte injunction cannot be held to be a mere formality This requirement is consistent with the principle that a party to a suit who is being restrained from exercising a right which such party claims to exercise either under a statute or under the common law must be informed why instead of following the requirement of Rule the procedure prescribed under the proviso has been followed The party which invokes the jurisdiction of the court for grant of an order of restraint against a party without affording an opportunity to him of being heard must satisfy the court about the gravity of the situation and court has to consider briefly these factors in the ex parte order Proviso to Rule of Order of the Code attracts the principle that if a statute requires a thing to be done in a particular manner it should be done in that manner or not at all To make it clear that whenever a court considers it necessary in the facts and circumstances of a particular case to pass an order of injunction without notice to other side it must record the reasons for doing so and should take into consideration while passing an order of injunction all relevant factors including as to how the object of granting injunction itself shall be defeated if an ex parte order is not passed Now I shall consider whether the impugned order can be interfered by exercising the constitutional remedy under Article of the Constitution of India or the aggrieved party has to go before the same court for vacation of the injunction order or file an appeal before the appellate court to vindicate their grievance In the said decision the power of the court to pass ex pane order of injunction with or without notice interim or temporary or till further orders or till the disposal of the suit and the non compliance of Rule a or as well as interference by this <ORG> exercising Article of the Constitution of India have been considered He alleged that the defendants to have been threatening to dispossess him The appellant plaintiff filed the suit on for a decree of permanent injunction restraining defendant Nos to from dispossessing him Along with the institution of the suit he moved an application under Order Rules and of the Code of Civil Procedure to pass an ad interim injunction restraining the respondents to or their men or agents or their representatives or any person claiming through them or under them from evicting the petitioner from the suit property other than by due process of law In the order the learned Judge has stated that he perused the documents The first respondent on behalf of himself and respondents to filed a revision petition invoking Article of the Constitution before this court alleging that they purchased the property from the owners thereof its per different sale documents executed on and they were in possession and enjoyment of the property The learned Single Judge of this <ORG> who disposed of the revision made the observation that the trial court ought not have granted an order of injunction at the first stage itself which could operate beyond thirty days as the court had then no occasion to know of what the affected party has to say about it Such a course is impermissible under Order Rule A of the Code according to the learned Single Judge and therefore he set aside the injunction order After holding that there is no documents to show that the first respondent is actually in possession and running such a business except the lease deed he came to the conclusion that the ex parte order is unsustainable and accordingly set aside the order of the trial Judge It was contended before the Supreme court that the High <ORG> should not have entertained a petition under Article of the Constitution when the respondent had two remedies statutorily available to him first is that the respondent could have approached the trial court for vacating if not for any modification of the interim ex parte order passed Second is that an appeal could have been preferred by him against the said order After referring to Rule of Order the Supreme <ORG> has arrived at the following conclusion para of What would be the position if a court which passed the order granting interim ex parte injunction did not record reasons thereof or did not require the applicant to perform the duties enumerated in Clauses a and of Rule of Order In our view such an order can be deemed to contain such requirements at least by implication even if they are not stated in so many words But if a party in whose favour an order was passed ex pane fails to comply with the duties which he has to perform as required by the proviso quoted above he must take the risk Non compliance with such requisites on his part cannot be allowed to go without any consequence and to enable him to have only the advantage of it The consequence of the party who secured the order for not complying with the duties he is required to perform is that he cannot be allowed to take advantage of such order if the order is not obeyed by the other party A disobedient beneficiary of an order cannot be heard to complain against any disobedience alleged against another party It is the acknowledged position of law that no party can be forced to suffer for the inaction of the court or its omissions to act according to the procedure established by law Under the normal circumstances the aggrieved party can prefer an appeal only against an order passed under Rules A or of Order of the Code in terms of Order Rule of the Code He cannot approach the appellate or revisional court during the pendency of the application for grant or vacation of temporary injunction In such circumstances the party who does not get justice due to the inaction of the court in following the mandate of <ORG> must have a remedy So we are of the view that in a case where the mandate of Order Rule A of the Code is flouted the aggrieved party shall be entitled to the right of appeal notwithstanding the pendency of the application for grant or vacation of a temporary injunction against the order remaining in force In such appeal if preferred the appellate court shall be obliged to entertain the appeal and further to take note of the omission of the subordinate court in complying with the provisions of Rule A In appropriate cases the appellate court apart from granting or vacating or modifying the order of such injunction may suggest suitable action against the erring judicial officer including recommendation to take steps for making adverse entry in his ACRs Failure to decide the application or vacate the ex parte temporary injunction shall for the purposes of the appeal be deemed to be the final order passed on the application for temporary injunction on the date of expiry of thirty days mentioned in the Rule Though the said decision supports the contention of the learned counsel for the respondents the facts in that case clearly show that the learned Single Judge of <ORG> interfered in the revision filed under Article of the Constitution mainly on the ground that the trial court ought not have granted an order of injunction at the first stage itself which could operate beyond days and according to the learned single Judge such a course is impermissible under Order Rule A of the Code He therefore set aside the injunction order for the clear transgression of the provisions of law and noted that this is the third suit filed in reference to the suit property and hence deprecated the grant of ex parte injunction without notice Order Rule A of the Code emphasises that <ORG> should dispose of the applications for injunction within days It is clear that where an injunction has been granted without giving notice to the opposite party the <ORG> shall make an endeavour to finally dispose of the application within days from the date on which the injunction was granted and where it is unable so to do it shall record its reasons for such inability In the present case the learned Subordinate Judge Cuddalore by Order dated case has granted ad interim injunction till The Hon ble Supreme <ORG> after holding that the said Rule does riot say that the period of injunction should be restricted by the <ORG> to days at the first instance but the court should pass final order on it within days from the day on which the injunction was granted came to the conclusion that the order does not ipso facto become illegal merely because it was not restricted to a period of days or less It is also clear that the <ORG> Supreme <ORG> was to consider the consequence if any on account of the court failing to pass the final orders within days as enjoined by Rule A Only in this context the Supreme <ORG> has held that the aggrieved party shall be entitled to the right of appeal notwithstanding the pendency of the application for grant or vacation of a temporary injunction against the order remaining in force The reading of paragraph of their Judgment it is clear that the aggrieved party can prefer an appeal only against an order passed under Rules A or of Order of the Code in terms of Order Rule of the Code The Hon ble Supreme <ORG> has also expressed that in a case where the mandate of order Rule A of the Code is floated the aggrieved party shall be entitled to the right of appeal notwithstanding the pendency of the application for grant or vacation of a temporary injunction against the order remaining in force They also observed that in such appeal if preferred the appellate court shall be obliged to entertain the appeal and further to take note of the omission of the subordinate <ORG> in complying with the provisions of Rule A In the present case inasmuch as the learned Subordinate Judge has not recorded the reason for its opinion for granting ad interim injunction without giving notice of application to the opposite party I am of the view that the said decision is not helpful to the respondents case as claimed by Mr <NAME> Rule A of Order specifically provides that where an injunction has been granted without giving a notice to the opposite party the <ORG> shall make an endeavour to finally dispose of the application within days from the date on which the injunction was granted and where it is unable so to do it shall record its reasons for such inability Therefore it becomes incumbent on the part of the <ORG> granting an injunction without giving a notice to the opposite party to decide the application within four weeks That being the position the practice of filing a Civil Revision Petition against the ad interim injunction and entertaining of the same by this <ORG> cannot be encouraged rather it should be deprecated and discontinued Though Mr <NAME> heavily relied on the above passage of the conclusion of the Hon ble Judge it is to be noted that the said conclusion had been arrived at in a revision filed under Section against the ex parte order of injunction passed under Order Rules and I have already stated that the case before the learned Judge relates to revision filed under Section In such a circumstance I am of the view that the conclusion arrived at by the learned Judge is to be confined to the revision petitions filed under Section accordingly the same is also not helpful to the present case In the said decision Their Lordships have held in para that when there is error of jurisdiction or flagrant violation of the law laid down by this <ORG> by exercising the revisional powers the court can set aside the order passed by the <ORG> to do justice between the parties As already referred to by me in the case of granting injunction without hearing the opposite party it is mandatory on the part of the trial court to record the reasons for its opinion for granting such injunction As observed by the Hon ble Supreme <ORG> Proviso to Rule of Order of the Code attracts the principle that if a statute requires a thing to be done in a particular manner it should be done in that manner or not at all
