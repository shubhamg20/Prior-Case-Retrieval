These two appeals are filed against the common order passed in Writ Petitions Nos and of by <NAME> dismissing the petitions The appellant hereinafter referred to as the assessee was the petitioner in the said petitions and the ITO Company Circle III Bangalore was the respondent In the writ petitions the assessee prayed for the issue of an appropriate writ order or direction quashing the two notices dated March issued by the respondent under of the I Act hereinafter referred to as the Act proposing to reassess the income of the assessee for the assessment years and on the ground that he had reason to believe that certain income of the assessee had escaped assessment in each of the above assessment years and for a writ in the nature of prohibition restraining the respondent from taking any steps pursuant to the said notices The sale of these products is being effected by the assessee through its selling agents <ORG> which is a firm carrying on business at Madras with whom the assessee has entered into an agreement The assessee has been making payments to the said firm for the services rendered in connection with the sale of its products The question whether the said payments could be treated as revenue expenditure and if so to what extent arose for consideration before the income tax authorities in the earlier assessment years i and having regard to A a of the Act and the relationship that existed between the directors of the assessee company and the partners of the firm of <ORG> After perusing the tripartite agreement dated December entered into between the assessee the selling agents and <ORG> and on the basis of the material available on record the <ORG> concluded that the selling agents <ORG> had been rendering various services and providing various facilities to the assessee such as i giving guidelines to the assessee in the matter of manufacture of various models and range of pressure cookers in the light of their own market research ii giving advice to the assessee in the matter of selection and appointment of distributors for the sale of cookers and fixing the terms and conditions thereof and also advising termination of services of distributors as and when required iii making reports to the assessee on the activities of the competitors iv participation in the finalisation of advertisement and sales promotional campaigns supervising the activities of the distributors vi attending to complaints of consumers vii helping the assessee in the matter of collection from distributors viii helping the assessee in liaison work with Government authorities ix helping the assessee in procuring raw materials and helping the assessee in the matter of excise duty etc The <ORG> also perused the resolution dated October passed by the assessee company in its extraordinary general meeting appointing <ORG> as sole selling agents on a commission of on cookers and on spare parts and considered that with the passage of time as and when the assessee came to undertake the after sale service the quantum of commission had to be reduced gradually to and respectively The departmental stand that there was no specific agreement entered into by the assessee with <ORG> was rejected by the <ORG> which held that the various resolutions passed by the assessee company and the tripartite agreement earlier referred to constituted the agreement When the assessment of the income of the assessee arose during the assessment year the <ORG> disallowed by his order dated August the claim made by the assessee regarding payments made to the selling agents as the decision of the <ORG> had not yet been rendered on the appeals referred to above The assessee filed an appeal against the said order of assessment before the <ORG> In the assessment order dated January passed in respect of the assessment year the ITO himself granted the allowance claimed in respect of payments made to the selling agents as by then the appellate orders of the <ORG> in respect of the earlier years had been pronounced It would appear that the internal audit party raised an objection regarding allowance having been made in respect of payments made to the selling agents under A a of the Act as according to them the case had to be dealt with under i of the Act In view of the observations made by the audit party the <ORG> decided to issue the impugned notices under of the Act proposing to reopen the assessments for the assessment years and and to make a reassessment Aggrieved by the said notices the assessee filed the two writ petitions The petitions were dismissed at the stage of preliminary hearing by the learned single judge observing that since it was open to the assessee to appear before the <ORG> and to urge that there was no case for reopening the assessment proceedings already completed they were not fit cases for interference at this stage These appeals are filed against the orders of the learned single judge After the respondent was served with the notices in these appeals he has filed a statement of objections to the relief claimed by the assessee The Income tax Officer accordingly took action under section and initiated proceedings by issue of notice under section for both the assessment years The appellant has challenged these notices in the writ appeals on various grounds The grounds on which the notices are challenged are i that it was not open to the department to reopen the assessments for the two years having accepted the <ORG> order on the same point for the assessment year ii the notices were issued only on a change of opinion iii that section of the Act has no application to the assessee case and the only section which has application is section A iv neither section a nor is applicable to the assessee case It is submitted that none of the grounds referred to above is available to the assessee to urge in the writ appeals for the following reasons i that for the assessment year the order of the <ORG> is accepted by the department is not relevant for initiating action under section for the subsequent assessment years ii the notices are not issued only on account of mere change of opinion on the part of the Income tax Officer but were issued as a consequence of audit objections raised by the internal audit party iii whether the provisions of section A or of section are applicable to the facts of the case is a matter exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Income tax Officer to adjudicate under the Act and this is not a matter for interference by this hon ble court under art iv the notices are issued under section and the records of assessment contain the information in support of the action and the notices are validly issued Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in sections to the following amounts shall not be deducted in computing the income chargeable under the head Profits and gains of business or profession in the case of any company i any expenditure which results directly or indirectly in the provision of any remuneration or benefit or amenity to a director or to a person who has a substantial interest in the company or to a relative of the director or of such person as the case may be ii any expenditure or allowance in respect of any assets of the company used by any person referred to in sub clause i either wholly or partly for his own purposes or benefit if in the opinion of the Income tax Officer any such expenditure or allowance as is mentioned in sub clauses i and ii is excessive or unreasonable having regard to the legitimate business needs of the company and the benefit derived by or accruing to it therefrom so however that the deduction in respect of the aggregate of such expenditure and allowance in respect of any one person referred to in sub clause i shall in no case exceed A where such expenditure or allowance relates to a period exceeding eleven months comprised in the previous year the amount of seventy two thousand rupees where such expenditure or allowance relates to a period not exceeding eleven months comprised in the previous year an amount calculated at the rate of six thousand rupees for each month or part thereof comprised in that period Provided that in a case where such person is also an employee of the company for any period comprised in the previous year expenditure of the nature referred to in clauses i ii iii and iv of the second proviso to clause a of sub section of section A shall not be taken into account for the purposes of sub clause A or sub clause as the case may be The provisions of this section shall have effect notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any other provision of this Act relating to the computation of income under the head Profits and gains of business or profession a Where the assessee incurs any expenditure in respect of which payment has been or is to be made to any person referred to in clause of this sub section and the Income tax Officer is of opinion that such expenditure is excessive or unreasonable having regard to the fair market value of the goods services of facilities for which the payment is made or the legitimate needs of business or profession of the assessee or the benefit derived by or accruing to him therefrom so much of the expenditure as is so considered by him to be excessive or unreasonable shall not be allowed as a deduction Provided that the provisions of this sub section shall not apply in the case of an assessee being a company in respect of any expenditure to which sub clause i of clause of section applies There is no dispute in this case that if i is applicable to the case then the challenge to the impugned notices has to fail There is also no dispute about the nature of services and facilities that were provided by the selling agents for which payments have been made The questions raised in these appeals have therefore to be decided on the above basis They are i Whether it is open to this court under article of the Constitution to quash the impugned notices and to issue an order restraining the Income tax Officer from taking further steps ii Whether the observations made by the internal audit party amounts to information within the meaning of that expression in section of the Act and iii Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case the Income tax Officer had in consequence of such information reason to believe that income chargeable to tax had escaped assessment for the assessment years in question The first question arises out of the contention urged on behalf of the department that the petitions are barred under art of the Constitution which provides that no petition for the redress of any injury referred to in sub clause or sub clause of clause of art The prayers made in the writ petitions are that the notices issued under of the Act in contravention of law which are likely to result in injury of a substantial natural may be quashed and a writ in the nature of prohibition may be issued to the respondent restraining him from taking any further step pursuant to the impugned notices The question is whether the law provides any alternative machinery through which the assessee can secure the reliefs prayed for in the petitions It may be possible for a party to a proceeding before an inferior court or <ORG> to urge all his contentions against the jurisdiction assumed by it and challenge its decision on that question either before a higher court or tribunal to which an appeal or revision petition may lie against such decision or by applying for a writ in the nature of certiorari under art But there is one fundamental distinction between the two writs and that is what is material for the present purpose They are issued at different stages of the proceedings When an inferior court takes up for hearing a matter over which it has no jurisdiction the person against whom the proceedings are taken can move the superior court for a writ of prohibition and on that an order will issue forbidding the inferior court from continuing the proceedings On the other hand if the court hears that cause or matter and gives a decision the party aggrieved would have to move the superior court for a writ of certiorari and on that an order will be made quashing the decision on the ground of want of jurisdiction It might happen that in a proceeding before the inferior court a decision might have been passed which does not completely dispose of the matter in which case it might be necessary to apply both for certiorari and prohibition certiorari for quashing what had been decided and prohibition for arresting the further continuance of the proceeding Authorities have gone to this extent that in such cases when an application is made for a writ of prohibition and there is no prayer for certiorari it would be open to the court to stop further proceedings which are consequential on the decision Broadly speaking and apart from the cases of the kind referred to above a writ of prohibition will lie when the proceedings are to any extent pending and a writ of certiorari for quashing after they have terminated in a final decision It is well settled that the writ of prohibition lies not only for excess of jurisdiction or for absence of jurisdiction but the writ also lies in case of departure from the rules of natural justice See Halsbury Laws of England rd edn It was held for instance by <ORG> in King <NAME> KB that as the order of the judge of <ORG> of July was made without giving the vicar an opportunity of being heard in his defence the order was made in violation of the principles of natural justice and was therefore an order made without jurisdiction and the writ of prohibition ought to issue But the writ does not lie to correct the course practice or procedure of an inferior tribunal or a wrong decision on the merits of the proceedings It is also well established that a writ of prohibition cannot be issued to a court or an inferior tribunal for an error of law unless the error makes it go outside its jurisdiction See <NAME> Comptroller General of Patents and Designs WLR at QB and <ORG> <NAME> CLR If there is want of jurisdiction then the matter is coram non judice and a writ of prohibition will lie to the court or inferior tribunal forbidding it to continue proceedings therein in excess of its jurisdiction The petitioner who questioned the jurisdiction of the authority to issue such a notice applied under art <ORG> of Patna took the view that the Bihar Sales Tax Act undoubtedly conferred jurisdiction on the STO to investigate the question of liability of a dealer to sales tax and accordingly he was well within his jurisdiction in issuing the impugned notice and dismissed the petition observing that if on assessment it was found that the order was erroneous the matter could be agitated in appeal under that Act It has been argued that the application was premature for there has so far been no investigation or finding on facts and no assessment under section of the Act In the first place it ignores the plain fact that this notice calling upon the appellant company to forthwith get itself registered as a dealer and to submit a return and to deposit the tax in a treasury in Bihar places upon it considerable hardship harassment and liability which if the Act is void under article read with article constitute in praesenti an encroachment on and an infringement of its right which entitles it to immediately appeal to the appropriate court for redress It is therefore not reasonable to expect the person served with such an order or notice to ignore it on the ground that it is illegal for he can only do so at his own risk and peril This court has said in the last mentioned case that a person placed in such a situation has the right to be told definitely by the proper legal authority exactly where he stands and what he may or may not do Another plea advanced by the respondent <ORG> is that the appellant company is not entitled to take proceedings praying for the issue of prerogative writs under article as it has adequate alternative remedy under the impugned Act by way of appeal or revision The remedy under the Act cannot be said to be adequate and is indeed nugatory or useless if the Act which provides for such remedy is itself ultra vires and void and the principle relied upon can therefore have no application where a party comes to court with an allegation that his right has been or is being threatened to be infringed by a law which is ultra vires the powers of the legislature which enacted it and as such void and prays for appropriate relief under article We are therefore of the opinion for reasons stated above that <ORG> was not right in holding that the petition under article was misconceived or was not maintainable <NAME> mentioned more than once the fact that the company would have sufficient opportunity to raise this question viz whether the Income tax Officer had reason to believe that under assessment had resulted from non disclosure of material facts before the Income tax Officer himself in the assessment proceedings and if unsuccessful there before the Appellate Officer or <ORG> or in <ORG> under section of the India Income tax Act The existence of such alternative remedy is not however always a sufficient reason for refusing a party quick relief by a writ or order prohibiting an authority acting without jurisdiction from continuing such action of the Constitution which restricts the scope of power of <ORG> under art was no bar to entertain petition in which the validity of a notice under of the Act was challenged holding that there was no provision in the Act providing for any remedy for the redress of any injury that might be caused to the assessee if the assessment was allowed to be reopened and that a suit in which the validity of such notice could be questioned could not be considered as an alternative remedy barring the jurisdiction of <ORG> under art of the Constitution precluded an assessee from challenging a notice issued under of the Act relying upon the observations made by <ORG> in the case of <ORG> and holding that <ORG> had recognised the existence of an alternative remedy We are of the view that the case has to be examined in the light of the amended art which imposes a restriction on the power of <ORG> and the nature of the alternative remedy available In that case <ORG> qualified the words alternative remedy with the word such as referring to the remedy by way of an appeal and reference under to <ORG> which were referred to by the counsel for the department We respectfully agree with the views expressed in the above decisions of the <ORG> of Gujarat Calcutta and Orissa in so far as the question of issue of a writ in the nature of prohibition is concerned and hold that the writ petitions out of which these appeals arise are not barred by art any appropriate order or direction restraining the continuance of an illegal proceeding if on merits the case requires <ORG> to do so Hence we reject the first contention The third question relates to the jurisdiction of the <ORG> to issue the impugned notices on the facts and in the circumstances of the case It is argued by Sri <NAME> learned counsel for the revenue that the question whether the information he had was sufficient to issue the impugned notices was a matter for the decision of the <ORG> and cannot be canvassed before this court in a petition under art In the case of <ORG> <ORG> rejected a similar contention while considering the validity of a notice issued under of the Indian I Act which correspond to ss and of the Act in the following terms <NAME> argued that the question whether the Income tax Officer had reason to believe that under assessment had occurred by reason of non disclosure of material facts should not be investigated by the courts in an application under article Learned counsel seems to suggest that as soon as the Income tax Officer has reason to believe that there has been under assessment in any year he has jurisdiction to start proceedings under section by issuing a notice provided years have not elapsed from the end of the year in question but whether the notices should have been issued within a period of years or not is only a question of limitation which could and should properly be raised in the assessment proceedings It is wholly incorrect however to suppose that this is a question of limitation only not touching the question of jurisdiction The scheme of the law clearly is that where the Income tax Officer has reason to believe that an under assessment has resulted from non disclosure he shall have jurisdiction to start proceedings for reassessment within a period of years and where he has reason to believe that an under assessment has resulted from other causes he shall have jurisdiction to start proceedings for reassessment within years Both the conditions i the Income tax Officer having reason to believe that there has been under assessment and ii his having reason to believe that such under assessment has resulted from non disclosure of material facts must co exist before the Income tax Officer has jurisdiction to start proceedings after the expiry of years The argument that the court ought not to investigate the existence of one of these conditions viz that the Income tax Officer has reason to believe that under assessment has resulted from non disclosure of material facts cannot therefore be accepted in which of the Act arose for consideration in the following terms <ORG> may therefore issue a high prerogative writ prohibiting the Income tax Officer from proceeding with reassessment when it appears that the Income tax Officer had no jurisdiction to commence the proceeding The condition which invests the Income tax Officer with jurisdiction has two branches i that the Income tax Officer has reason to believe that income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment and ii that it is in consequence of information which he has in his possession that he has reason so to believe Since the learned judges of <ORG> have concentrated their attention upon the second branch of the condition and have reached their conclusion in favour of the assessees on that branch it would be appropriate to deal with the correctness of that approach The expression information in the context in which it occurs must in our judgment mean instruction or knowledge derived from an external source concerning facts or particulars or as to law relating to a matter bearing on the assessment If as a result of information in his possession the Income tax Officer has reason to believe that income chargeable to tax had escaped assessment the Income tax Officer has jurisdiction to assess or reassess income under section of the Income tax Act Information in his possession that income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment furnishes a starting point for assessing or reassessing income If he has that information the Income tax Officer may commence proceedings for assessment or reassessment To commence the proceeding for reassessment it is not necessary that on the materials which came to the notice of the Income tax Officer the previous order of assessment was vitiated by some error of fact or law <ORG> exercising jurisdiction under article of the Constitution has power to set aside a notice issued under section of the Income tax Act if the condition precedent to the exercise of the jurisdiction does not exist The court may in exercise of its powers ascertain whether the Income tax Officer had in his possession any information the court may also determine whether from that information the Income tax Officer may have reason to believe that income chargeable to tax had escaped assessment It is thus clear that it is open to this court to examine whether the information was such that prima facie it may be said that the <ORG> had reason to believe that income chargeable to tax had escaped assessment This leads us on to the facts of these cases As mentioned earlier the <ORG> had after an elaborate investigation came to the conclusion that the payments made by the assessee to its selling agents were not either excessive or unreasonable having regard to the services and facilities provided by the selling agents by applying A of the Act Even though the non obstante clause in A gives the provisions of that section an overriding effect over the other provisions of the Act the proviso to that section excludes the application of that section to any expenditure to which sub clause i of clause of of the Act applies Since the facts are not in dispute we shall examine whether sub clause i of clause of applies at all to the present case That sub clause refers to any expenditure incurred by a company which results directly or indirectly in the provision of any remuneration or benefit or amenity to a director or to a person who has a substantial interest in the company or to a relative of the director or of such person as the case may be Section provides that it is open to the ITO to determine whether the remuneration benefit or amenity is excessive or unreasonable having regard to the legitimate business needs of the company and the benefit derived by or accruing to it therefrom and also places a maximum limit on the deduction that may be claimed in respect of the aggregate of such expenditure and allowance in respect of any one person by declaring that in no case it shall exceed Rs and where such expenditure or allowance relates to a period not exceeding eleven months comprised in the previous year an amount calculated at the rate of Rs for each month or part thereof comprised in that period A close reading of the above provision shows that refers to an expenditure incurred by making periodical payments to a person mentioned in that clause apparently for any personal service that may be rendered by him It cannot have any reference to payments made by the assessee for all kinds of services or facilities referred to in A a It is argued that the proviso thereto suggests that any expenditure incurred for any kind of service which is referred to in the main part of A a and the expenditure referred to in belong to the same category at thus The proper course is to apply the broad general rule of construction which is that a section or enactment must be construed as a whole each portion throwing light if need be on the rest The true principle undoubtedly is that the sound interpretation and meaning of the statute on a view of the enacting clause saving clause and proviso taken and construed together is to prevail Unless the words are clear the court should not so construe the proviso as to attribute an intention to the legislature to give with one hand and take away with another To put it in other words a sincere attempt should be made to reconcile the enacting clause and the proviso and to avoid repugnancy between the two If the remuneration benefit or amenity referred to in is treated as the same as what is paid in return for the goods services or facilities then irrespective of the fair market value of the goods services and facilities provided by a person who may be a director or who has a substantial interest in the company or a relative of the director or of such person as the case may be only a maximum of Rs They take diverse forms such as packing and forwarding transport service advertisement service warehousing facilities processing collection of price insurance of goods etc We do not think that in these circumstances payment made to such a selling agent can be treated as an expenditure referred to in of the Act But A was introduced in the year in the Act apparently for the purpose of preventing the abuse of excessive or unreasonable payments being made by assessee to persons referred to therein in lieu of goods services and facilities If the payments represent a fair market value then there is no limitation on the total amount payable during any period We are of the view that expenditure incurred by way of commission paid to a selling agent who acts as an independent entrepreneur with an independent organization which is not subject to the control and supervision of the assessee for the services and facilities provided by him cannot therefore be considered as equivalent to remuneration or benefit or amenity referred to in of the Act In the instant case it is not disputed that <ORG> Company the selling agents have been providing the services and facilities under the agreement as independent entrepreneurs and it has been held that the commission paid to them was not excessive At this stage it is appropriate to set out a part of the order of the <ORG> dated October in respect of the assessment years to It reads On a careful consideration of the facts of the case on record we are of the opinion that the commission paid to the selling agents in this case is neither excessive nor unreasonable having regard to the tests set forth in section A a If the assessee company had these facilities it would have incurred costs which the assessee had estimated at about Rs As regards the legitimate business reeds we have already set out the background in which the tripartite agreement was entered into between the assessee company the foreign company and <ORG> and Company Having carefully considered all the aspects of the caes we have no hesitation in upholding the findings of the <ORG> arrived at on the facts of the case The total payment made to the selling agents may be in excess of Rs But as long as the case does fall under there is no justification for the <ORG> to issue the impugned notices even though the audit party may have said so We therefore held that the <ORG> had no jurisdiction to issue the impugned notices under of the Act as he could not reasonably entertain any doubt that any part of the assessee income had escaped assessment by reason of not applying to the case In the result we allow these appeals reverse the common order passed by the learned single judge and quash the notices issued under of the Act which are impugned in these cases We also direct the respondent in each of these cases not to take any further proceedings pursuant to the impugned notices Parties shall bear their own costs
