The charge against them was that they had in furtherance of their common intention committed the murder of one <NAME> at about on April in front of the shop of a milk vendor Chhunno situate in Lathi Mohal Collectorganj in the City of Kanpur This was not liked by <NAME> and <NAME> who gave a threat to <NAME> <NAME> reported the matter to his father who thereupon instructed his employees that one or the other of them should keep <NAME> company whenever he was going away from the house or the shop <NAME> retorted that he had seen many a person like <NAME> whereupon <NAME> asked the other two accused to finish <NAME> <NAME> the brother of <NAME> came on the scene From some distance he first saw that <NAME> <NAME> and two or three other persons had caught hold of <NAME> and after advancing further he saw his brother <NAME> lying on the road with injuries that they were taking <NAME> to the Police Station He left it to <NAME> to remove <NAME> to the hospital These were sent to the Chemical Analyser in due course who certified that whereas there was human blood on the shirt the blood on the knife had disintegrated The necessary entries were made with regard to the progress of the investigation in the General Diary of the Police Station and <NAME> went on duty at his place being taken by Head Constable <NAME> On being informed by somebody that a man was lying injured he went to the place and saw the injured person On receiving that message he sent a wireless message to patrol car No in charge of <NAME> and at the same time also sent the message to <ORG> within whose jurisdiction the man was lying He reached the place at about The man who was standing there said that he was the brother of the injured person obviously referring to <NAME> and gave the name and address of the injured He therefore took Constable <NAME> of that <ORG> along with him in the car and though the brother of the injured <NAME> wanted to go in the car to the hospital he could not be accommodated He recovered the blood stained earth from the place where <NAME> had fallen and recorded also the statements of eye witnesses who had accompanied him from the Police Station <NAME> went to the hospital at about a but there was a delay in obtaining the body in The house of <NAME> which was close to the shop of <NAME> his uncle was searched at about or a but he was not found After returning to the Police Station at A he recorded the statement of <NAME> and sent him to the Jail Doctor as there were two small injuries on the little finger of the right hand turned on him and he received injuries on both his hands He asked the officers to take down his information but they said that they would make the investigation first and then record his statement He further stated that he had been made to sit there in the <ORG> Station till about midnight and the officers asked him to give evidence against two or three persons whose names he could not recall at the time He refused to oblige saying that though he did not know the names of the assailants he could recognise them if shown to him Though <NAME> had stated that he received injuries on both the hands it is now established that he had only two wounds on the inner surface of the right hand little finger only one being a slight lacerated wound and the other an incised wound above it The injuries were one above the other on one finger of one hand that is the right hand and there was no injury on the left hand We may mention here only that both the courts agree that these injuries on the little finger sustained by <NAME> must have been caused in the act of inflicting injuries on another person with a knife and not in warding off knife blows by a third person <NAME> had deliberately told a falsehood that he had received injuries on both hands taking the cue from the error made in the medical certificate with a view to suggest that the injuries on both hands were more likely to be caused when he was warding off an assault on him <NAME> was examined as a witness to suggest that the story told by <NAME> in court was probable It is not in dispute that deceased <NAME> was attacked with knives at about and he had fallen on the road hardly two or three paces away from the shop of <NAME> the milk vendor There is no dispute also that whosoever be the assailants it was a clear case of murder There was a great possibility that these very accused might have been involved in the affair but however strong the suspicion there could be no conviction Accordingly the learned <NAME> Judge gave the benefit of doubt to the accused and acquitted them Before rejecting the testimony of the eve witnesses the learned Sessions Judge should have considered the question as to whether the prosecution case as to the pursuit given to the miscreants and as to the apprehension of respondent <NAME> on the spot and as to his being taken in custody to the Police Station was established or not The one grave error which he committed was that he first recorded a finding on the question as to whether the eye witnesses could have been present at the scene of occurrence or not After hearing counsel on behalf of the accused and the <ORG> and on a perusal of the evidence to which our attention was invited we have come to the conclusion that the above criticism of <ORG> was fully justified It was submitted that Mr <NAME> was a disinterested witness and if his evidence is accepted it would be clearly established that neither <NAME> nor <NAME> could have been there before and hence the story now told by the prosecution that the first information had been recorded at the instance of <NAME> at is demonstrably false even after enquiry did not learn about any of these things it would be clearly established that <NAME> must not have come there at all till <NAME> was removed from the place and if <NAME> was not there at all the story told by <NAME> that he had met <NAME> before leaving the scene of offence was false That in all probability <NAME> was also not there at the time of the incident because if he had been there and <NAME> was not there he would not have left the place leaving <NAME> unattended There were other captors of <NAME> and he could have requested the captors to take <NAME> to the Police Station and remained behind to make arrangements for removing <NAME> to the hospital Therefore the case now put forward by the prosecution that he had gone to the Police Station with <NAME> and had filed the first information at is false The whole argument proceeds on the assumption that if <NAME> were on the scene of offence According to <NAME> and the eye witnesses <NAME> arrived just when they were taking him away He merely told <NAME> to attend to his brother saying that he was taking <NAME> to the Police Station That was also not unlikely because <NAME> evidence shows that after closing the shop at he was coming that way to go to his house and the scene of offence was on the way not far from the shop There is further indication in his evidence that at least to minutes must have passed between the stabbing and the actual arrival of Mr <NAME> on the scene After returning to his house Mr <NAME> had telephoned to the Control Room and that was at There is record about this at the Control Room Mr <NAME> says that there was a crowd when he went there but he says that it was a crowd of about to people Nor can it be said that Mr <NAME> had taken the trouble to make any serious enquiry because if he were serious about it he could have made enquiries with the milk vendor <NAME> who was admittedly in his shop and the man had fallen only two or three paces away in front of <NAME> shop It would therefore appear that Mr <NAME> must have casually asked the first man he met in the crowd as to who the boy was and he must not have received any answer In fact he admits that when he put the first question he did not receive any answer and so he did not make any further enquiry One does not know with whom he made the enquiry He might be just a passerby who like the other members of the crowd might have had only a casual interest Assuming further that he was near enough to hear the question of Mr <NAME> he might not have cared to answer him because to him he was just another passerby whose idle curiosity he may have ignored to satisfy through sheer tiresomeness We have already referred to the evidence of <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> Moreover the Investigating Officer had recorded more detailed statements of <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> that same night at about and it is not elicited from their cross examination by reference to the police statements that they had failed to mention the presence of <NAME> at the time of the departure from the scene of offence at Then again there is the evidence of Sub Inspector <NAME> who says that when he came to the scene at about he had met <NAME> at the place Later the Officer in charge of <ORG> reached the place at and he met <NAME> there and it was <NAME> who furnished him the name and address of <NAME> And if <NAME> was there as alleged by the prosecution there was no difficulty in <NAME> proceeding to the Police Station with <NAME> leaving <NAME> at the scene to make arrangements for removing <NAME> to the hospital Then again if <NAME> and the other captors of <NAME> proceeded to the Police Station from the scene of occurrence soon after there is no dispute that they would be in the Police Station at about for recording the complaint The allegation is that after the Investigating Officer found that an offence had been committed in a particular locality he decided to falsely im plicate the accused because of some grudge against <NAME> It is not the case that <NAME> or the other two eye witnesses who were perfect strangers had any interest in implicating falsely any of the accused in this case There were serious difficulties however in accepting such a defence Apart from entries with regard to the investigation of the offence that same night there are also other entries made in the General Diary in serial order which had nothing to do with this offence The learned Sessions Judge however brushed aside the difficulty with the facile observation that all those entries which are shown to have been made in the night in the General Diary must not have been made at all at the time and that after keeping some space blank in the General Diary those entries must have been made on the next day The diary should be a complete but brief record of the proceedings of the police and of occurrences reported to them or of which they have obtained information and the two Head Moharrirs who were incharge of the General Diary on that night namely <NAME> and <NAME> had been examined in the case there is no cross examination of these witnesses on the charge now made But what we find is that even before this intimation was received several entries have been made in connection with this offence the first of them being at relating to the First Information lodged by <NAME> In fact Head Constable <NAME> says that when he was recording the statement of <NAME> this particular message was received from the Control Room at and at that very time he told the Control Room on the phone that a report in respect of that offence had already been lodged at <ORG> and necessary action was being taken It is not suggested that <NAME> who was in charge of the Control Room had anything to do with any mischief contemplated by the officers of this Police Station and it would only show that <NAME> was telling the truth when he said that when the message was received from the Control Room the investigation of this offence was in progress Therefore there is no reason whatsoever why the entry should not have been made at the time when the message was received If none of the persons interested in complaining about the offence had reached <ORG> at that time and there was no known source of information at <ORG> with regard to the offence there could not have been any good reason at all why the entries should not be made in the usual course According to the learned Judge <NAME> must have given information about his companions <NAME> and <NAME> and that was the reason why the officers attached to <ORG> stayed their hands and refrained from making any entry about the information given by <NAME> Now the case of <NAME> as disclosed in his statement under Section Criminal Procedure Code is that he had merely seen two or three persons assaulting <NAME> the deceased with knives and since he knew <NAME> he went to his rescue The assailants of <NAME> however turned on him and he got injuries on both his hands He therefore left the place and went to <ORG> to make a report Therefore there is no basis for the conjecture of the learned Sessions Judge that the names of <NAME> and <NAME> might have been mentioned by <NAME> as the assailants It would be extravagant to suggest that on hearing of a stabbing case within his area the Officer would at once think of <NAME> and <NAME> with a view to implicate them falsely without ascertaining in the first place the circumstances of the stabbing the availability of <NAME> and <NAME> on that day at the particular place and time the probability of eye witnesses mentioning the names of other assailants and the inclination of the relations of <NAME> to help the officer in his mischievous plans Secondly <NAME> would be the last person to go to <ORG> by himself when there were circumstances which would impel him to keep himself as far away from <ORG> as possible It is therefore impossible to believe the story of <NAME> that he had gone to <ORG> by himself to report about the assault on <NAME> and that though he made his report the Officer decided not to record it It necessarily follows from the above discussion that <NAME> must have been brought to the Police Station with the blood stained knife by somebody at and in that behalf we have a large body of evidence both of the eye witnesses <NAME> etc <NAME> I was recorded the necessary seizure memos were prepared the General Diary entries were posted and thereafter we know from <NAME> evidence that he went off duty at The Investigating Officer <NAME> however took some more time at the Police Station to complete the proceedings before he went to the scene of offence There was no particular hurry because he had already come to know that <ORG> had been contacted and there were people attending to <NAME> at the scene of offence The offence which had been recorded at the time was only under Section I In our opinion there was no sufficient basis for the learned Sessions Judge to think that the information about this offence had not been received till early next morning and that the General Diary had not been posted with the entries in due course of official business <NAME> had been brought to the Police Station with a blood stained knife and the eve witnesses were available who had also taken part in chasing and capturing <NAME> As mentioned earlier none of the three eye witnesses had any personal interest in implicating the three accused <ORG> has accepted their evidence as substantially true and we do not think that we have any good grounds to differ from <ORG> assessment of the
