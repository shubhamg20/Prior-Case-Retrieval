No other relief is sought in the suit The first contention raised on behalf of the defendants is that the suit as framed is not maintainable It was argued that a mortgagor must file a suit for redemption and offer to pay the mortgage debt after the due date has expired if he wants any relief against the mortgagees who are acting under the mortgage deed The Advocate General for the plaintiff strongly relied on the last case where it was observed that a mortgagor can ask for an injunction in the event of the mortgagee attempting to exercise his power of sale improperly or irregularly In the first case the suit was filed for redemption and the Court held that even after such a suit was filed the mortgagee could exercise the power of sale contained in the mortgage deed and cannot be restrained from exercising his power of sale merely because of the redemption suit The mortgagor is entitled to have the sale of the property suspended only if he can shew either that he has paid off the mortgage lien or that he has made a legal tender of the amount due which has been refused No case was cited before me to show that if the right to redeem had not accrued to the mortgagor he could not bring in a suit for an injunction restraining a wrongful sale but that his only remedy was either to pay or tender the moneys and allow the property to be sold and then pursue his remedy in damages if any The facts there clearly show that the mortgage debt was alleged by the mortgagee to be due while it was contended by the mortgagor that the event on which the due date was accelerated either had not happened or that the mortgagee had not exercised his option to call in his mortgage amount on the happening of such an event The observations in each individual judgment have to be read in the light of facts found in the case and under the circumstances it does not appear to me that any of the three cases relied upon by the plaintiff sustains the contention that after the mortgage debt has become due the mortgagor is entitled to file a suit to restrain the mortgagee from exercising the power of sale without offering to redeem and tendering the amount By that document the plaintiff had stipulated that he would pay the mortgage amount on July to the mortgagees The present demand on the part of the plaintiff is to enforce his right under that contract although he has committed a breach of one of the most important terms of the same The argument of the defendants is that as the plaintiff has committed a breach of the contract he has no right to come to <ORG> and seek to enforce it against the defendants It is argued that relief by way of injunction is granted on the same principles on which the <ORG> will order specific performance and in this case if the plaintiff had asked for specific performance of this contract the <ORG> would have refused it because the plaintiff himself had committed a breach thereof In my opinion there is considerable force in this contention The relief by way of injunction is always discretionary and the <ORG> will be slow to grant such a relief to a party who admits that he has committed a breach of the contract and at the same time wants to prevent the opposite party from enforcing his rights under the contract In my opinion the suit as framed is not maintainable and the mortgagor should pray for redemption before asking the <ORG> to intervene and grant an injunction restraining the defendants from exercising their power of sale This leaves the question whether the power of sale is wholly illegal On the merits an interesting argument was advanced on behalf of the plaintiff The power of sale in this case is in the following terms And it is hereby agreed and declared that notwithstanding anything contained in the Trustees and Mortgagees Powers Acticle it shall be lawful for the mortgagees or any person acting on their behalf at any time or times hereafter as well before as after the due date without any further consent on the part of the mortgagor to sell or to concur in the sale of the mortgaged premises hereby mortgaged and granted or expressed so to be or any part or parts thereof without the intervention of the <ORG> and either together or in parcels or lots and either by public auction or private contract and either with or without any special conditions or stipulations relative to title or evidence of commencement of title or otherwise which may be deemed proper by the mortgagees with power to postpone such sale from time to time and to buy in the said hereditaments and premises or any part thereof at any sale by public auction or to rescind or vary any contract for the sale thereof and to resell the same from time to time being not answerable or responsible for any loss or diminution occasioned thereby and for the purposes aforesaid or any of them to make agreements execute assurances give effectual receipts or discharges for the purchase money and do all other acts and things for completing the sale which the person or persons exercising the power of sale shall think proper AND the aforesaid power shall be deemed to be a power to sell or in selling without intervention of the <ORG> within the meaning of section of the Transfer of Property Act It was contended that this was not authorised by Section of the Transfer of Property Act and therefore the power was invalid It was argued that this power was one and indivisible and as it was bad the mortgagees had no right to sell the property without the intervention of <ORG> This is made clear by the preamble to that Act Section of that Act recognised this as an implied power of sale in the mortgagee The words used in Section are shall subject to the provisions of this section have power to sell and the insertion of a clause giving such a power when the property is situate in one of the Presidency towns or the towns mentioned in Sub section is valid It may be noted that in Sub section the words used are Where a power of sale without the intervention of the <ORG> is expressly conferred on the mortgagee The argument of the plaintiff based on the construction of the words used in this case is also unsound A power of sale must include all steps which are necessary to be taken in that connection Therefore if the plaintiff contends that this particular clause restricts in any way the power of the parties to enter into a contract the burden is on him to show that the words of the section prevent an agreement between the parties as embodied in the document It was argued that under Section a mortgagee had no power to postpone the sale A power to sell must necessarily include a power to postpone the sale I do not think that expression is against the words used in Section It was contended that the power to buy in or rescind or vary any contract for sale was bad and against the words of Section This argument is based on a misapprehension No mortgagee has a right to buy the mortgage premises without an express authority from the <ORG> It should be realised that if at an auction sale there are several intending purchasers and the highest bid is very inadequate a way has to be found by which the property is not sold to the highest bidder and cause a tremendous loss both to the mortgagor and the mortgagee The mortgagee is given a right to buy in or to rescind i to set aside the contract of buying or vary any contract for sale and to resell the same Therefore when an auction sale is found not to result in realising the proper value the mortgagee may either postpone the sale or if he finds that he is unable to do so because the auction sale had started he has to resort to the second way to prevent the property being knocked down at an undervalue and to resell the same I do not think on a true interpretation the clause relating to the power of sale gives the mortgagees a right to buy the property for themselves Unless that construction is put on this clause there is nothing to violate the words power to sell used in Section The suit is therefore dismissed with costs Costs to include costs reserved
