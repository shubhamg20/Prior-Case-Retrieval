ORDER Per <NAME> This appeal by the assessee for assessment year is directed against the order dated passed under section of the Income tax Act by <ORG> Patiala Brief facts of the case are these The assessee is an individual who had income for two months from to as proprietor of <ORG> dealing in manufacture and sale of poultry feeds The assessee also started a proprietary business in the name of <ORG> Jagraon which ran for two months for February and March There was an income tax search at the premises of the assessee on when certain books of accounts and documents were taken into possession by the <ORG> Commissioner accordingly issued a show cause notice dated listing as many as nine items which were not considered by the Assessing Officer at the time of original assessment Commissioner after enumerating the nine items mentioned the show cause notice in the body of the order passed under section of the Act took cognizance of the reply submitted by the assessee but he<NAME> that it was neither proper nor possible for him to verify the explanation furnished by the assessees learned counsel It is against this order that the assessee has come up in appeal before us counsel in fact drew our attention to the various notices issued by the Assessing Officer before completing the assessment to which a reference had been made above It was also submitted that the order under section was a quasi judicial order and it was necessary for assuming jurisdiction that there should be a proper and valid reason for doing so and the conclusion of the ld Commissioner had not gone into the explanation furnished by the assessee nor had he come to a definite conclusion that the order passed by the <ORG> was erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of the revenue As regards item No vii it was submitted that the assessee in his detailed reply before the Commissioner had pointed out that <ORG> was incorporated on and that no income was earned up to when the assessee resigned from directorship It was pointed out that in the reply submitted it had been explained that the proprietary concern was proposed to be converted into a partnership concern for which purpose a partnership deed dated was also executed but this remained a paper transaction only and no activity was done by the partnership concern It was also pointed out that neither any investment was made nor did the firm actually come into existence As regard item No ix it was submitted that all the incriminating documents had been gone into by the ITO and that the search took place as a result of the machination of a disgruntled and dismissed employee of the assessee <NAME> counsel for the assessee therefore vehemently argued that there was absolutely no justification for assuming jurisdiction under section by the ld CIT nor for passing the order setting aside the assessment to be made afresh ITR for the proposition that the power of revision by the Commissioner under section of the Act is quasi judicial in character and he must give reasons in support of his conclusion that the assessment order is erroneous insofar as it is prejudicial to the interests of the revenue If he does not give reasons the order would stand vitiated Writing an order in detail may be legal requirement but the order not fulfilling this requirement cannot be said to be erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of the revenue We have carefully considered the submission of both the sides We find considerable merit in the arguments of <NAME> which have been put forth in a very clear cut manner We find that the assessment order framed by the Assessing Officer was passed under section after making all the necessary enquiries In the instant case what we find is that the <ORG> Commissioner has neither looked into the submissions made on behalf of the assessee nor came to a firm conclusion that the assessment order was erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of the revenue The case law cited by the assessee and referred to above makes it abundantly clear that the <ORG> Commissioner must state the reasons for intervention before assuming jurisdiction under section and while passing the order under section must come to a conclusion that the order passed by the Assessing Officer was not only erroneous but also prejudicial to the interests of the revenue In the case of <ORG> supra the facts were more or less similar to what we find in the instant case The <ORG> Commissioner intervened under section of the Act and set aside the order of assessment with a direction to make fresh assessment on the ground that business loss of the assessee amounting to Rs <ORG> he<ORG> that the Commissioner did not furnish his opinion or consider the cited cases or the arguments raised and merely observed that these were the points which deserved consideration and after setting aside the order of the <ORG> Assessing Officer issued a direction for making assessment afresh which was not permissible under the provisions contained in section of the Act In the present case also the Commissioner has not come to a firm conclusion as to how the order passed by the Assessing Officer was erroneous The assessee had all furnished a cogent reply before the <ORG> Commissioner when a show cause notice issued under section was issued In the face of this evidence the <ORG> Commissioner cou<ORG> not pass an order under section by remarking that it was neither proper nor possible for him to verify the explanation furnished by the assessees counsel We have therefore no hesitation to say that the impugned orders stands vitiated for the reasons mentioned above and is hereby vacated
