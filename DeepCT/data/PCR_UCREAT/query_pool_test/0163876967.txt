REPORTABLE IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION CRIMINAL APPEAL NOS OF <NAME> APPELLANT VERSUS STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH RESPONDENT <NAME> These appeals are directed against the common impugned judgment dated th March passed by <ORG> Principal Seat at Jabalpur by which <ORG> upheld the judgment of conviction and sentence for the offences and IPC as follows Section Sentence imposed For offence under Section Sentenced to death The learned counsel for the appellant assailed the conviction inter alia on the following grounds a The trial was not fair as the appellant was not given an opportunity to defend by the counsel of his choice On th May accused came to their house in Sector No Quarter No Colony Singrauli at about He had a chat with <NAME> Begum deceased for about minutes PW was on duty and on receiving the news he came to the place of incident and took <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> to Nehru Hospital The dead body of <NAME> was sent for postmortem examination He submitted his postmortem report Ext There was depressed fracture of skull bone underneath the injuries On the information given by the appellant under Section of the Indian Evidence Act he recovered stolen articles iron hammer and blood stained clothes from the house of the accused situated in Colony After due investigation the chargesheet was filed and the case was committed for trial Prosecution examined altogether witnesses and produced a number of documentary evidence to prove their case Dr <NAME> PW who performed the postmortem examination of the body of <NAME> found the following injuries on her body Reddish contusion cm cm present on right side of forehead In his opinion death of deceased <NAME> had occurred as a result of coma due to head injury In his opinion death of <NAME> had occurred as a result of coma due to injury and and the evidence of Sub Inspector Paraste PW and constable <NAME> PW who conducted inquest it was established that <NAME> and <NAME> died of homicidal injuries found on their bodies <NAME> <NAME> PW Investigation Officer arrested the accused from Khariya Chowk Main Road P<NAME>S<NAME> Shakti Nagar in the presence of witnesses <NAME><NAME><NAME> PW and <NAME><NAME> Yunus PW and seized money from him and prepared seizure memo Ext<NAME>P <NAME> After arrest the accused was brought to the Police Station Jayant and was interrogated in front of the witnesses<NAME> During interrogation accused gave information regarding jewellery and the hammer which was used in committing crime the clothes hammer and jewellery were seized from the house of the accused vide memorandum Ext<NAME>P written by <NAME> PW <NAME> <NAME> stated that he went to the house of accused and seized the jewellery article from articles A to A seizure memo Ext<NAME>P was prepared<NAME> He had also stated that blood stained clothes and iron hammer were seized in the presence of witnesses vide seizure memo Ext<NAME>P <NAME> Both the witnesses thereby have corroborated the statement of <NAME> There is no infirmity or contradiction in the statements of the two witnesses Both the witness PW and PW clearly stated that sometime before the incident the accused had come to their house and he being a prior acquaintance the accused had taken refreshment sitting with their mother and also was talking with her The prosecution proved beyond reasonable doubt that even prior to the incident the accused was known to the deceased and the injured witnesses PW and PW and on the date of incident also the accused had come to their house and had taken refreshments and had talks <NAME> PW and <NAME> PW in their statements clearly stated that initially the accused left their house and after sometime the accused had come again to their house On opening the door he had hit the hammer on the head of <NAME> who had come out after hearing screams of <NAME> and then after entering into the bedroom he hit deceased <NAME> on her head In paragraph <NAME> PW has also stated that she had seen the accused hit <NAME> on his head but she could not see as to who hit <NAME> and her mother Similarly from the statement of <NAME> PW we find that the accused after hitting <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> took away jewellery cash amount and the bangles of <NAME> and then he ran away after bolting the door from outside Statements of <NAME> PW about shouting from the balcony stopping <NAME> PW and then opening of the door by <NAME> are also proved by the statement of Ramesh <NAME> PW who made similar statement In view of the statements made by the injured witnesses <NAME> PW and <NAME> PW as corroborated by the postmortem report seizure of jewellery hammer blood stained clothes Ex First ground taken by the learned counsel for the appellant with respect to denial of opportunity to the accused to be defended by a counsel of his choice is incorrect as from the record we find that proper opportunity was given to the accused The order sheets of <ORG> dated th September shows that the appellant made an application that appellant wanted to get the witnesses cross examined by senior Advocate Mr <NAME> therefore he requested to defer the cross examination of the witnesses On th September when the case was fixed for evidence though he was competent to cross examine the witnesses but he moved the application to defer the cross examination of the witnesses on the ground that the accused wanted to engage senior Advocate Mr <NAME> None of those witnesses were eyewitnesses in fact one of them <NAME> PW was declared hostile Since there was none to represent the accused <ORG> appointed Mr <NAME> Advocate to pursue the appeal The next question is whether death sentence awarded to the appellant is excessive disproportionate on the facts and circumstance of the case i whether the present case can be termed to be a rarest of the rare case In this background the guidelines indicated in <NAME> case SCC will have to be culled out and applied to the facts of each individual case where the question of imposing of death sentence arises The following propositions emerge from <NAME> case supra i The extreme penalty of death need not be inflicted except in gravest cases of extreme culpability ii Before opting for the death penalty the circumstances of the offender also require to be taken into consideration along with the circumstances of the crime In other words death sentence must be imposed only when life imprisonment appears to be an altogether inadequate punishment having regard to the relevant circumstances of the crime and provided and only provided the option to impose sentence of imprisonment for life cannot be conscientiously exercised having regard to the nature and circumstances of the crime and all the relevant circumstances iv A balance sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances has to be drawn up and in doing so the mitigating circumstances have to be accorded full weightage and a just balance has to be struck between the aggravating and the mitigating circumstances before the option is exercised In order to apply these guidelines inter alia the following questions may be asked and answered a Is there something uncommon about the crime which renders sentence of imprisonment for life inadequate and calls for a death sentence Are the circumstances of the crime such that there is no alternative but to impose death sentence even after according maximum weightage to the mitigating circumstances which speak in favour of the offender These principles have been applied in various judgments of this Court thereafter and it is unnecessary to multiply the cases here Whether the case is one of the rarest of the rare cases is a question which has to be determined on the facts of each case Suffice it to mention that the choice of the death sentence has to be made only in the rarest of the rare cases and that where culpability of the accused has assumed depravity or where the accused is found to be an ardent criminal and menace to the society and where the crime is committed in an organised manner and is gruesome cold blooded heinous and atrocious where innocent and unarmed persons are attacked and murdered without any provocation the case would present special reason for purposes of sub section of Section of the Criminal Procedure Code Considering the cumulative effect of all the factors like the offences committed under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance the young age of the accused the possibility of reform and rehabilitation etc The court is expected to keep in mind the facts and circumstances of a case the principles of law governing award of sentence the legislative intent of special or general statute raised in pic the case and the impact of awarding punishment These are the nuances which need to be examined by the court with discernment and in depth The legislative intent behind enacting Section CrPC clearly demonstrates the concern of the legislature for taking away a human life and imposing death penalty upon the accused Concern for the dignity of the human life postulates resistance to taking a life through law instrumentalities and that ought not to be done save in the rarest of rare cases unless the alternative option is unquestionably foreclosed In exercise of its discretion the court would also take into consideration the mitigating circumstances and their resultant effects The language of Section demonstrates the legislative concern and the conditions which need to be satisfied prior to imposition of death penalty The words in the case of sentence of death the special reasons for such sentence unambiguously demonstrate the command of the legislature that such reasons have to be recorded for imposing the punishment of death sentence This is how the concept of the rarest of rare cases has emerged in law The death penalty should be imposed in the rarest of rare cases and that too for special reasons to be recorded ii Before opting for the death penalty the circumstances of the offender also requires to be taken into consideration along with the circumstances of the crime death sentence must be imposed only when life imprisonment appears to be an altogether inadequate punishment having regard to the relevant circumstances of the crime and provided and only provided the option to impose sentence of imprisonment for life cannot be conscientiously exercised having regard to the nature and circumstances of the crime and all the relevant circumstances iv A balance sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances has to be drawn up and in doing so the mitigating circumstances have to be accorded full weightage and a just balance has to be struck between the aggravating and the mitigating circumstances before the option is exercised The judgment in <NAME> did not only state the above guidelines in some elaboration but also specified the mitigating circumstances which could be considered by the <ORG> while determining such serious issues and they are as follows SCC para In the exercise of its discretion in the above cases the court shall take into account the following circumstances That the offence was committed under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance If the accused is young or old he shall not be sentenced to death The probability that the accused would not commit criminal acts of violence as would constitute a continuing threat to society The probability that the accused can be reformed and rehabilitated The <ORG> shall by evidence prove that the accused does not satisfy Conditions and above That the accused acted under the duress or domination of another person That the condition of the accused showed that he was mentally defective and that the said defect impaired his capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct Now we may examine certain illustrations arising from the judicial pronouncements of this <ORG> this Court took the view that custodial torture and consequential death in custody was an offence which fell in the category of the rarest of rare cases While specifying the reasons in support of such decision the Court awarded death penalty in that case In that case the friends of the victim had called him to see a movie and after seeing the movie a ransom call was made but with the fear of being caught they murdered the victim The Court felt that there was no evidence to show that the criminals were pic incapable of reforming themselves that it was not a rarest of the rare case and therefore declined to award death sentence to the accused Similarly the intensity of bitterness which prevailed and the escalation of simmering thoughts into a thirst for revenge and retaliation were also considered to be a relevant factor by this Court in different cases This <ORG> in Satishbhushan Bariya supra also considered various doctrines principles and factors which would be considered by the <ORG>s while dealing with such cases The <ORG> discussed in some elaboration the applicability of the doctrine of rehabilitation and the doctrine of prudence While considering the application of the doctrine of rehabilitation and the extent of weightage to be given to the mitigating circumstances it noticed the nature of the evidence and the background of the accused Thus applying the doctrine of prudence it noticed the fact that the accused were unemployed young men in search of job and they were not criminals In execution of a plan proposed by the appellant and accepted by others they kidnapped a friend of theirs The kidnapping was done with the motive of procuring ransom from his family but later they murdered him because of the fear of getting caught and later cut the body into pieces and disposed it off at different places One of the accused had turned approver and as already noticed the conviction was primarily based upon the statement of the approver The above principle as supported by case illustrations clearly depicts the various precepts which would govern the exercise of judicial discretion by the courts within the parameters spelt out under Section CrPC Awarding of death sentence amounts to taking away the life of an individual which is the most valuable right available whether viewed from the constitutional point of view or from the human rights point of view The condition of providing special reasons for awarding death penalty is not to be construed linguistically but it is to satisfy the basic features of a reasoning supporting and making award of death penalty unquestionable The circumstances and the manner of committing the crime should be such that it pricks the judicial conscience of the court to the extent that the only and inevitable conclusion should be awarding of death penalty The court would consider the cumulative effect of both these aspects and normally it may not be very appropriate for the court to decide the most significant aspect of sentencing policy with reference to one of the classes under any of the following heads while completely ignoring other classes under other heads It will be appropriate for the court to come to a final conclusion upon pic balancing the exercise that would help to administer the criminal justice system better and provide an effective and meaningful reasoning by the court as contemplated under Section CrPC Aggravating circumstances The offences relating to the commission of heinous crimes like murder rape armed dacoity kidnapping etc by the accused with a prior record of conviction for capital felony or offences committed by the person having a substantial history of serious assaults and criminal convictions The offence was committed while the offender was engaged in the commission of another serious offence The offence was committed with the intention to create a fear psychosis in the public at large and was committed in a public place by a weapon or device which clearly could be hazardous to the life of more than one person The offence of murder was committed for ransom or like offences to receive money or monetary benefits The offence was committed outrageously for want only while involving inhumane treatment and torture to the victim The offence was committed by a person while in lawful custody The murder or the offence was committed to prevent a person lawfully carrying out his duty like arrest or custody in a place of lawful confinement of himself or another For instance murder is of a person who had acted in lawful discharge of his duty under Section CrPC When the victim is innocent helpless or a person relies upon the trust of relationship and social norms like a child helpless woman a daughter or a niece staying with a father uncle and is inflicted with the crime by such a trusted person When murder is committed for a motive which evidences total depravity and meanness When there is a cold blooded murder without provocation pic The chances of the accused of not indulging in commission of the crime again and the probability of the accused being reformed and rehabilitated The condition of the accused shows that he was mentally defective and the defect impaired his capacity to appreciate the circumstances of his criminal conduct The circumstances which in normal course of life would render such a behaviour possible and could have the effect of giving rise to mental imbalance in that given situation like persistent harassment or in fact leading to such a peak of human behaviour that in the facts and circumstances of the case the accused believed that he was morally justified in committing the offence Where the court upon proper appreciation of evidence is of the view that the crime was not committed in a preordained manner and that the death resulted in the course of commission of another crime and that there was a possibility of it being construed as consequences to the commission of the primary crime Where it is absolutely unsafe to rely upon the testimony of a sole eyewitness though the prosecution has brought home the guilt of the accused Principles The court has to apply the test to determine if it was the rarest of rare case for imposition of a death sentence The option to impose sentence of imprisonment for life cannot be cautiously exercised having regard to the nature and circumstances of the crime and all relevant considerations In my considered view the tests that we have to apply while awarding death sentence are crime test criminal test and the test and not the balancing test To award death sentence the crime test has to be fully satisfied that is and criminal test that is no mitigating circumstance favouring the accused If there is any circumstance favouring the accused like lack of intention to commit the crime possibility of reformation young age of the accused not a menace to the society no previous track record etc the criminal test may favour the accused to avoid the capital punishment Even if both the tests are satisfied that is the aggravating circumstances to the fullest extent and no mitigating circumstances favouring the accused still we have to apply finally the rarest of the rare case test test test depends upon the perception of the society that is society centric and not Judge centric that is whether the society will approve the awarding of death sentence to certain types of crimes or not The courts award death sentence since situation demands so due to constitutional compulsion reflected by the will of the people and not the will of the Judges In the present case the appellant is an educated person he was about years old at the time of committing the offence There is nothing specific to suggest the motive for committing the crime except the articles and cash taken away by the accused It is true that the accused has committed a heinous crime but it cannot be held with certainty that this case falls in the rarest of the rare category On appreciation of evidence on record and keeping in mind the facts and circumstances of the case we are of the view that sentence of death penalty would be extensive and unduly harsh Accordingly we commute the death sentence of appellant to life imprisonment
