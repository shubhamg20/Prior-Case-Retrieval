perusal of the records of the assessee for the two assessment years noticed that the orders were erroneous and prejudicial to the interest of the revenue and accordingly show cause notices were issued to the assessee requiring to show cause as to why the orders of assessment made by the assessing officer should not be set aside with a direction to the assessing officer to consider that points contained in the show cause notices The Commissioner found that the Income Tax Officer had not considered the points while completing the assessment and therefore overruled the objections raised by the assessee After noticing some of those items he came to the conclusion that those items represent various issues covered in the show cause notices and many of them could be considered after the examination of the books of the assessee The questions relate to the jurisdiction of the Commissioner under section of the Income Tax Act hereinafter referred to as the Act The Commissioner on perusal of the records of the assessee for the two assessment years noticed that the orders were erroneous and prejudicial to the interest of the revenue and accordingly show cause notices were issued to the assessee requiring to show cause as to why the orders of assessment made by the assessing officer should not be set aside with a direction to the assessing officer to consider that points contained in the show cause notices The Commissioner found that the Income Tax Officer had not considered the points while completing the assessment and therefore overruled the objections raised by the assessee After noticing some of those items he came to the conclusion that those items represent various issues covered in the show cause notices and many of them could be considered after the examination of the books of the assessee The assessee challenged the order of the Commissioner before <ORG> <ORG> held that the Commissioner had no jurisdiction to revise the orders of assessment made in pursuance of the directions of the Inspecting Assistant Commissioner on the ground that there was a statutory merger of the order of the Income Tax Officer with that of the Inspecting Assistant Commissioner The <ORG> recorded a finding that the order of the Commissioner was not a speaking order and the Commissioner has not given any clear finding that any of the items listed in the order was erroneous and prejudicial to the interest of the revenue The <ORG> also held that there is no material to show the assessments were made in a hurry especially when the procedure prescribed under section had been followed and the higher authority had been associated in making the orders of assessment The <ORG> therefore held that the procedure adopted by the Commissioner would vitiate the order of the Commissioner and cancelled the order passed by the Commissioner and allowed the appeal preferred by the assessee The assessee challenged the order of the Commissioner before <ORG> <ORG> held that the Commissioner had no jurisdiction to revise the orders of assessment made in pursuance of the directions of the Inspecting Assistant Commissioner on the ground that there was a statutory merger of the

submitted that under the provisions of section of the Act the Commissioner has wide powers to remit the matter to the assessing officer and it is for the Commissioner to pass such orders thereon as the circumstances of the case would justify He also submitted that the <ORG> was not correct in holding that the Commissioner had surrendered his jurisdiction in favour of the audit party and the report of the audit party would constitute a material for the Commissioner to exercise his revisional jurisdiction under section The submission of the learned counsel for the revenue was that the circumstances relied on by the Commissioner would clearly show that the orders of the assessment were erroneous and they were not in accordance with law and tile Commissioner has jurisdiction to exercise the powers conferred under section The learned counsel for the assessee on the other hand submitted that it is the duty of the Commissioner to record his final conclusion on the matters raised in the show cause notices especially when the assessee in his reply has pointed out that there were no mistakes or errors in the orders of assessment passed by the assessing officer The learned counsel for the assessee further submitted that the Commissioner had not exercised the jurisdiction conferred upon him properly as the Commissioner after setting out the objections raised by the audit party and the reply submitted by the assessee set aside the orders of assessment with a direction to the assessing officer to complete the assessment The learned counsel foil lie assessee also submitted that the orders of the Income Tax Officer should not only be erroneous but the order should have resulted in prejudice to the interests of the revenue and unless the two conditions prescribed in section are satisfied the Commissioner has no power to revise the orders of the Income Tax Officer of dated wherein this Court held that the Commissioner has the jurisdiction under section to interfere with the order passed by the Income Tax Officer as per he directions given by the Inspecting Assistant Commissioner under section of the Act of dated wherein this Court held that the Commissioner has the jurisdiction under section to interfere with the order passed by the Income Tax Officer as per he directions given by the Inspecting Assistant Commissioner under section of the Act Section empowers the Commissioner to call for and examine the record of any proceeding under the Act and if he considers that any order passed by the Income Tax Officer is erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of the revenue he may after complying with the principles of natural justice pass such orders thereon as the circumstances of the case require including an order enhancing or modifying the assessment or cancelling the assessment and directing the fresh assessment <ORG> held that section empowers tile Commissioner to make or cause to be made such enquiry as the deems necessary in order to find out if the order passed by the Income Tax Officer was erroneous in so far as it is prejudicial to the interest of the revenue The only limitation on his power is that he must have some materials which would enable him to form a prima facie opinion that the order passed by the Income Tax Officer was erroneous insofar as it is prejudicial to the interests of the revenue Once he comes to the conclusion on the basis of the material that the order of the Income Tax Officer was erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of the the Commissioner is empowered to pass an order as the circumstances of the case may warrant He may pass an order enhancing the assessment or he may modify the assessment He is also empowered to the assessment and direct a fresh assessment The Commissioner is fully empowered to adopt any one of the three courses indicated the provisions of section and the Commissioner power cannot be faulted because he cancelled the assessment and directed a fresh assessment In the instant case the order of the Commissioner shows that he has gone through the records of the Income Tax Officer and he considered the order to he erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of the revenue on several matters for both the assessment orders He also gave detailed reasons with reference to some of the items for both the assessment years and he held that they were representatives of the various issues covered in the show cause notices On the above basis the Commissioner came to the conclusion that the order of the Income Tax Officer wits erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of the revenue and set aside the orders of the Income Tax Officer with the direction to the Income Tax Officer to consider the points in detail wherein it was held that the Commissioner cannot simply set aside the order unless he finds the order was erroneous On the other hand in the instant case the Commissioner has found that the records do not show that the Income Tax Officer had considered the points on which revision proceedings were initiated which indicate that there was a lack of proper enquiry Section empowers the Commissioner to call for and examine the record of any proceeding under the Act and if he considers that any order passed by the Income Tax Officer is erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of the revenue he may after complying with the principles of natural justice pass such orders thereon as the circumstances of the case require including an order enhancing or modifying the assessment or cancelling the assessment and directing the fresh assessment <ORG> held that section empowers tile Commissioner to make or cause to be made such enquiry as the deems necessary in order to find out if the order passed by the Income Tax Officer was erroneous in so far as it is prejudicial to the interest of the revenue The only limitation on his power is that he must have some materials which would enable him to form a prima facie opinion that the order passed by the Income Tax Officer was erroneous insofar as it is prejudicial to the interests of the revenue Once he comes to the conclusion on the basis of the material that the order of the Income Tax Officer was erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of the the Commissioner is empowered to pass an order as the circumstances of the case may warrant He may pass an order enhancing the assessment or he may modify the assessment He is also empowered to the assessment and direct a fresh assessment The Commissioner is fully empowered to adopt any one of the three courses indicated the provisions of section and the Commissioner power cannot be faulted because he cancelled the assessment and directed a fresh assessment In the instant case the order of the Commissioner shows that he has gone through the records of the Income Tax Officer and he considered the order to he erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of the revenue on several matters for both the assessment orders He also gave detailed reasons with reference to some of the items for both the assessment years and he held that they were representatives of the various issues covered in the show cause notices On the above basis the Commissioner came to the conclusion that the order of the Income Tax Officer wits erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of the revenue and set aside the orders of the Income Tax Officer with the direction to the Income Tax Officer to consider the points in detail wherein it was held that the Commissioner cannot simply set aside the order unless he finds the order was erroneous On the other hand in the instant case the Commissioner has found that the records do not show that the Income Tax Officer had considered the points on which revision proceedings were initiated which indicate that there was a lack of proper enquiry It is no doubt true that for making a valid order under section it is essential for the Commissioner to record an express finding that the order sought to be revised was erroneous as well as prejudicial to the interests of the revenue In the instant case the Commissioner had recorded such a finding and with reference to some of the items he positively found that the orders were erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of the revenue But in our opinion there is nothing in section to show that the Commissioner should in all cases record his final conclusion on the points in controversy before him It is no doubt true that for making a valid order under section it is essential for the Commissioner to record an express finding that the order sought to be revised was erroneous as well as prejudicial to the interests of the revenue In the instant case the Commissioner had recorded such a finding and with reference to some of the items he positively found that the orders were erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of the revenue But in our opinion there is nothing in section to show that the Commissioner should in all cases record his final conclusion on the points in controversy before him The above position of law is well settled by the decision of <ORG> in the case of Addl ITR wherein <ORG> held as under Now even on this question we find that there is nothing in section to show that before passing the final order under that section the Commissioner must necessarily and in all cases record final conclusions about the points in controversy before him As already noted by us above we would have expected him to record final conclusions which he thought proper if he was to settle the assessment finally but since he has not settled the assessment finally and has preferred to direct the Income Tax Officer to make an order for fresh assessment it was proper that he did not express any final conclusions and recorded only prima facie conclusions at which he had arrived with reference to the facts of the case Here it should be noted that as the assessment was to be freshly made by the Income Tax Officer the only proper course for the Commissioner was not to express any final opinion as regards the controversial points The further question that arises is whether in the absence of the final conclusion of the Commissioner on all the points raised in the show cause notices can it be said that the Commissioner has not exercised the jurisdiction properly We are of the opinion that it would all depend upon the facts of each case to decide whether the Commissioner had exercised the powers properly or not In the instant case the Commissioner found that the Income Tax Officer was not correct in granting relief to some of the items considered in the original assessment proceedings and from the instances or specimen of some of the cases examined by him he came to the conclusion that the Income Tax Officer had not completed the assessment by following the procedure expected of him Therefore it is not a case of the Commissioner directing fresh assessment without any material The order of the Commissioner clearly shows that he had enough materials and on that basis he exercised the powers of revision under section set aside the order and ordered to make fresh assessment The Commissioner has pointed out in the orders of revision that there were certain glaring mistakes in the orders of assessment made by the assessing officer and the Commissioner after examining the records held that the Income Tax Officer had not considered the points raised in the show cause notice and we are of the opinion that the Commissioner had properly exercised the jurisdiction under section The further question that arises is whether in the absence of the final conclusion of the Commissioner on all the points raised in the show cause notices can it be said that the Commissioner has not exercised the jurisdiction properly We are of the opinion that it would all depend upon the facts of each case to decide whether the Commissioner had exercised the powers properly or not In the instant case the Commissioner found that the Income Tax Officer was not correct in granting relief to some of the items considered in the original assessment proceedings and from the instances or specimen of some of the cases examined by him he came to the conclusion that the Income Tax Officer had not completed the assessment by following the procedure expected of him Therefore it is not a case of the Commissioner directing fresh assessment without any material The order of the Commissioner clearly shows that he had enough materials and on that basis he exercised the powers of revision under section set aside the order and ordered to make fresh assessment The Commissioner has pointed out in the orders of revision that there were certain glaring mistakes in the orders of assessment made by the assessing officer and the Commissioner after examining the records held that the Income Tax Officer had not considered the points raised in the show cause notice and we are of the opinion that the Commissioner had properly exercised the jurisdiction under section This Court also held that the Commissioner has the power to set aside a portion of the order of the assessing authority which is against the revenue or he may remit the matter to the Income Tax Officer for further enquiry after setting aside the relief given by the assessing officer Therefore the Commissioner in our opinion had set aside the orders of the Income Tax Officer insofar as they relate to the matters which were the subject matters of revision The learned counsel for the assessee strongly placed reliance on the decision of this Court in the case of <ORG> supra wherein this Court held that the prejudice contemplated under section must be prejudicial to the income tax administration as a whole and section cannot be invoked as a jurisdictional corrective or as a review of a subordinate order in exercise of the supervisory power We are of the opinion that the above decision has no application as the words prejudicial to the interests of the revenue as held by <ORG> in <ORG> case supra have wide impact and where it was found that the assessing officer failed to apply his mind in proper perspective and where the officer had completed the assessment without conducting or making the enquiry that is necessary for the purpose of deciding the issue before him the order passed in such circumstances can be said to be erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of the revenue in the sense that the order is not in accordance with law and once such a conclusion is reached by the Commissioner the Commissioner would have necessary power to invoke his jurisdiction under section The Commissioner is expected to examine the orders of assessment to find out whether there is any error resulting in prejudice to the interest of the revenue and in that process the question as to who participated in the assessment proceedings or made the order of assessment is an immaterial consideration This Court also held that the Commissioner has the power to set aside a portion of the order of the assessing authority which is against the revenue or he may remit the matter to the Income Tax Officer for further enquiry after setting aside the relief given by the assessing officer Therefore the Commissioner in our opinion had set aside the orders of the Income Tax Officer insofar as they relate to the matters which were the subject matters of revision The learned counsel for the assessee strongly placed reliance on the decision of this Court in the case of <ORG> supra wherein this Court held that the prejudice contemplated under section must be prejudicial to the income tax administration as a whole and section cannot be invoked as a jurisdictional corrective or as a review of a subordinate order in exercise of the supervisory power We are of the opinion that the above decision has no application as the words prejudicial to the interests of the revenue as held by <ORG> in <ORG> case supra have wide impact and where it was found that the assessing officer failed to apply his mind in proper perspective and where the officer had completed the assessment without conducting or making the enquiry that is necessary for the purpose of deciding the issue before him the order passed in such circumstances can be said to be erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of the revenue in the sense that the order is not in accordance with law and once such a conclusion is reached by the Commissioner the Commissioner would have necessary power to invoke his jurisdiction under section The Commissioner is expected to examine the orders of assessment to find out whether there is any error resulting in prejudice to the interest of the revenue and in that process the question as to who participated in the assessment proceedings or made the order of assessment is an immaterial consideration The learned counsel also placed reliance on the decision of <ORG> in the case of <ORG> supra The decision of <ORG> has no application to the facts of the case In the decision before <ORG> it was found that the Commissioner noticed that the order of the Income Tax Officer did not contain discussion with regard to the allowability of the claim for deduction The Commissioner therefore came to the conclusion that the claim of the assessee required examination as to whether the expenditure in question was allowable as a revenue expenditure or not allowable as a capital expenditure In the factual situation the Court held it is not open to the Commissioner to re examine the matter and he has no power to set aside the orders of assessment and direct the Income Tax Officer to re examine the issue The Commissioner here has recorded a finding that the orders of the Income Tax Officer were erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of the revenue Therefore the decision of <ORG> cited supra has no application to the facts of the case The learned counsel also placed reliance on the decision of <ORG> in the case of <ORG> supra The decision of <ORG> has no application to the facts of the case In the decision before <ORG> it was found that the Commissioner noticed that the order of the Income Tax Officer did not contain discussion with regard to the allowability of the claim for deduction The Commissioner therefore came to the conclusion that the claim of the assessee required examination as to whether the expenditure in question was allowable as a revenue expenditure or not allowable as a capital expenditure In the factual situation the Court held it is not open to the Commissioner to re examine the matter and he has no power to set aside the orders of assessment and direct the Income Tax Officer to re examine the issue The Commissioner here has recorded a finding that the orders of the Income Tax Officer were erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of the revenue Therefore the decision of <ORG> cited supra has no application to the facts of the case There is no quarrel over the proposition of law laid down by <ORG> in the case of <NAME> supra wherein <ORG> held that the twin conditions prescribed in section viz There is no quarrel over the proposition of law laid down by <ORG> in the case of <NAME> supra wherein <ORG> held that the twin conditions prescribed in section viz The learned counsel also relied upon the decision of <ORG> in the case of <ORG> supra and the decision of <ORG> in <ORG> case supra and submitted that the Commissioner in the instant case had exercised the powers of revision on the basis of report of audit party and therefore the Commissioner had no jurisdiction to invoke his jurisdiction under section The decision of <ORG> in <ORG> case supra has no application as the Commissioner there had surrendered his jurisdiction and authority to <ORG> in deciding the questions which were sought to be raised by the company in the revision application He is the head of the department in the administrative side and he is also given the power of quasi judicial nature under section to exercise the powers of revision There is no dispute that there is no right of appeal to the department against the orders of the assessing authority to the first appellate authority and jurisdiction to reopen or to rectify the mistake is subject to the fulfilment of statutory conditions to reopen the assessment or to rectify the mistake in the order The report of the audit does not in any way bind the Commissioner but nonetheless the Commissioner is empowered under section to make such enquiry and to find out that the order of the Income Tax Officer is erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of the revenue If after such investigation the Commissioner comes to the conclusion that the order is erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of the revenue he can pass any orders as he thinks fit but where the materials are already available on record there is nothing which precludes the Commissioner from taking into consideration already available materials on record <ORG> in the case of <ORG> supra has laid down the above proposition that it is open to the Commissioner to take into account the materials which come into existence subsequent to the completion of the orders of the assessment made by the Income Tax Officer The report of the internal audit party does not have any binding effect on the Commissioner and the order passed by the Commissioner shows that he has applied his mind independently to the errors pointed out by the internal audit party and then came to the conclusion that the orders passed by the Income Tax Officer were erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of the revenue Therefore it is not a case of the action initiated by the Commissioner on the binding circular issued by the higher authorities nor it is a case of surrender of jurisdiction in favour of any other authority but it is a case where the Commissioner had exercised the powers of revision after applying his mind in considering the question whether the orders were erroneous and prejudicial to the interest of the revenue in the revisional proceedings Consequently we hold that the Commissioner had exercised the powers and assumed the jurisdiction properly and the <ORG> was not correct in holding that the Commissioner lacked the jurisdiction under section The learned counsel also relied upon the decision of <ORG> in the case of <ORG> supra and the decision of <ORG> in <ORG> case supra and submitted that the Commissioner in the instant case had exercised the powers of revision on the basis of report of audit party and therefore the Commissioner had no jurisdiction to invoke his jurisdiction under section The decision of <ORG> in <ORG> case supra has no application as the Commissioner there had surrendered his jurisdiction and authority to <ORG> in deciding the questions which were sought to be raised by the company in the revision application He is the head of the department in the administrative side and he is also given the power of quasi judicial nature under section to exercise the powers of revision There is no dispute that there is no right of appeal to the department against the orders of the assessing authority to the first appellate authority and jurisdiction to reopen or to rectify the mistake is subject to the fulfilment of statutory conditions to reopen the assessment or to rectify the mistake in the order The report of the audit does not in any way bind the Commissioner but nonetheless the Commissioner is empowered under section to make such enquiry and to find out that the order of the Income Tax Officer is erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of the revenue If after such investigation the

the jurisdiction under section In the result we answer the questions and also in the negative and in favour of the revenue In the result we answer the questions and also in the negative and in favour of the revenue
