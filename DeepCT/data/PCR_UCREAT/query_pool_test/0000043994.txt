Provision had been made in the deed of settlement empowering the trustees to grant amongst other things lease of the trust property as they thought fit The said property continued to be occupied by the deceased as a continuing tenant for the last days of his life Before the Assistant Controller of Estate Duty two alternative contentions were raised on behalf of the accountable persons He took the view that the entire property did pass on the donor death because continued possession and enjoyment of the property was not immediately assumed by the donees and thenceforward retained to the entire exclusion of the donor or to the entire exclusion of any benefit to him by contract or otherwise On behalf of the Controller of Estate Duty the following question of law was suggested for reference to this Court Whether oh the facts and in the circumstances of the case the <ORG> was right in holding that in terms of Section of the Estate Duty Act only that portion of the property at No Queens Park Calcutta which was occupied by the deceased by virtue of the lease dated the nd July could be deemed to pass on his death and the value thereof only was to be included in the principal value of the estate The <ORG> was of opinion that the questions raised on behalf of the parties were counterparts of each other and framed the following question of law and referred it to this Court for opinion Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case and on a true interpretation of the provisions of Section of the Estate Duty Act the <ORG> was justified in holding that only that portion of the property at Queens Park Calcutta which was in the occupation of the deceased could be deemed to pass on the death of the deceased and not the whole of the property From the statement of the case relevant portions whereof I have referred to already it seems to me that this argument is of no substance Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the applicants has argued that the question at issue depends upon the true construction of Section of the Estate Duty Act which reads Property taken under any gift whenever made shall be deemed to pass on the donor death to the extent that bona fide possession and enjoyment of it was not immediately assumed by the donee and thenceforward retained to the entire exclusion of the donor or of any benefit to him by contract or otherwise Mr <NAME> then relied on a passage in the judgment of Lord <NAME> of Killowen in Commr For the propositions aforesaid Mr <NAME> has also relied on the cases of <NAME> Commr of Stamp Duties AC and the dictum of <ORG> in the case Lang <NAME> CLR Mr <NAME> says is the legal possession and enjoyment and not factual or physical and the principle is the cedent or donor must be entirely excluded from some enforceable right of a benefit of that which was part of his properly before the cession in other words an enjoyment by the donor of the same kind as before vide Lord Advocate <NAME> re affirmed in KB Supra In order to bring the case within the scope of the Section it is not sufficient states Mr <NAME> to take the situation as a whole and find that the donor has been allowed to enjoy substantial advantages which have some relation to the property given it is necessary to consider the nature and source of each of the advantages and determine whether or not it is a benefit of such a kind as to come within the section <NAME> Commr Mr <NAME> submits that the possession and enjoyment from which the <ORG> has not been excluded or to which he has been inducted must trench upon or impair and diminish the rights of the donee in the subject matter of the gift If a new right in the tangible property is created which does not affect the rights of the donee then the Section is not attracted Learned counsel then urged that in order that duty may be levied the burden of proof is upon the taxing authority who must bring the subject within the charge i establish that there was not an entire exclusion of the donor or of any benefit to him by contract or otherwise The Section does not impose an obligation to pay the duty leaving the accountable person to bring himself within the exception vide <NAME> case KB Supra It follows according to learned counsel that if there is any doubt as to the nature of the possession and enjoyment granted to the donor being that which he had before the cession then the duty is not exigible In the foregoing paragraphs I have set out all the points canvassed before us by learned counsel for the applicants I propose to rely on the observations made in <NAME> book confining myself however to the points that arise for our consideration in the instant case Our attention has not been drawn to any provision in the Indian Act similar to the provision in Section of the English Finance Act of There is a finding by the Appellate Controller at page of the paper book that bonafide possession and enjoyment of the property was perhaps assumed by the donees immediately upon the gift In this case the deceased gave his son a farming property Mia Mia in in the deceased the son and another son entered into a partnership agreement as graziers and Stock dealers on the terms inter alia that the deceased should be the Manager and that his decision should be final in all matters relating to the conduct of the business that the capital should consist of the live stock and plant owned by the partners that the business should be conducted on their respective holdings including Mia Mia and that the land held by each partner should be his sole property and he should have the sole and free right to deal with it as he might think fit There was an initial out right gitf of the property not of the property shorn of certain rights contrast AC More than months before her death she gave to her three sons blocks of this land each of which was surrounded by other of the land of the testatrix On the same day upon which the conveyances and transfers were executed each of the sons executed a lease for five years of the land given to him to the testatrix at a fair and reasonable rent Viscount <NAME> in <NAME> case AC has fully considered the effect of the decision in <NAME> case CLR and makes the following observations As long ago as in Lang <NAME> CLR a case whether a testatrix gave certain blocks of land to her son and on the same day took leases from them of the same land <NAME> <NAME> said the lease however gave to the doner possession and enjoyment of the land itself which is a simple negation of exclusion and bring the case within the statutory liability This view of the sub section has never been departed from and their Lordships respectfully adopt the words of <NAME> <NAME> in the present case I have given my anxious consideration to the arguments of Mr <NAME> that unless something is carved out of the subject matter of the gift and given to the donor the liability under the statute is not attracted To my mind the correct view is that so far as the upper portion of premises No Queens Park is concerned the lease gave to the donor possession and enjoyment of the property itself which is a negation of exclusion and brings the case within the statutory liability The principles decided in <NAME> case CLR has however been substantially negatived in England as respects deaths on and after the th July There is no difficulty it seems therefore in drawing upon the principles laid down in <NAME> case CLR for construing the relevant provisions in lection of the Estate Doty Act Accord ingly it appears that subject to Section of the English Finance Act in the case of land and chattels the condition regarding entire exclusion of the donor from the property would be infringed where the donor benefit consists of any form of possession or enjoyment of the gifted property itself or of property representing it In other words the first limb of the condition may be infringed if the donor occupies OK enjoys the property or its income even though he has no right to do so which he could legally enforce against the donee decision on which Mr <NAME> placed strong reliance in which cases the deceased either released with the decision in <NAME> case SC LR or made an absolute gift of the <NAME> a house and furniture to a relative without any stipulation but continued to live there as the donee guest until his death more than five years later and it was held that duty was not chargeable In the <NAME> case KB <NAME> in his remarks at of the report appears to have considered that the deceased exclusion from the property itself the first limb of the condition would like his exclusion from any benefit by contract or otherwise the second limb be achieved unless he had some enforceable right It is submitted in <NAME> book that if by this expression <NAME> meant a legally enforceable right against the donee his view cannot be sustained so far as the first limb is concerned in the light of the contrary authority noted above It may be observed however that although in cases like the Permanent Trustee case AC the donee could at any time have terminated the arrangement under which the deceased was not excluded nevertheless so long as the arrangement continued the deceased had a specific right whereas in the <NAME> case ScLR and the <NAME> case KB it appears that there was no specific arrangement at all and the deceased was simply the guest of the donee <NAME> said at of the report that there was no understanding that the deceased should be permitted to reside in the house I have no doubt that neither the donor nor the donee contemplated for one moment that the former would under any circumstances be turned out of the house but there was no discussion on the point and the donor befors he executed the Deed was fully aware that after executing the Deed he would be at the defendant mercy and was fully content to rely upon the affection which the defendant Bore towards his grand uncle and benefactor It is also stated in this text book that notwithstanding the sweeping character of the term entire exclusion there must it is thought be some limit to its meaning the condition cannot be infringed merely because the donor paid occasional visits to the donee and the <NAME> and <NAME> decisions Sc LR and KB if still valid indicate that more permanent residents as a guest does not offend the condition at any rate if there was no honourable understanding I have discussed alt the authorities which appear to me to be relevant for answering the question raised in this reference Section of the Estate Duty Act provides as we have already seen that property taken under any gift whenever made shall be deemed to pass on the donor death to the extent that bona fide possession and enjoyment of it was not immediately assumed by the donee and thenceforward retained to the entire exclusion of the donor or of any benefit to him by contract or otherwise So far as this aspect of the question is therefore concerned no assistance can be derived from decisions in other countries It is merely descriptive of the nature of the property given to the donee That is not the plain meaning of the expression at all and there is no reason why the meaning should be strained in the manner suggested by Mr <NAME> In any event the doubt if any has been resolved by the statement of objects and reasons whh respect to Section of the Estate Duty Act circulated to the members of <ORG>
