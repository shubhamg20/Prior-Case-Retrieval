The petitioners had been placed on trial along with two others named <NAME> and <NAME> The appellant <NAME> set up a case of alibi which may best be stated in his own words in his statement under Section Criminal before the Magistrate who held the inquiry It is convenient here to dispose of this particular defence of the accused to which our attention was invited by the learned counsel for the appellants It was taken at an early stage of the inquiry against the appellants and it could easily have been verified with reference to the official records It has been admitted in the evidence led on behalf of the prosecution that there was a function in the forenoon of the date of the occurrence at which the Chief Minister was present and the members of the <ORG> took their oath of office According to the evidence this function came to an end at about The burden of proving the alibi undoubtedly lay on the appellant <NAME> No attempt was made to call any evidence oral or documentary to prove that the appellant <NAME> was present at the ceremony and that it came to an end at about as alleged by him If that defence had been made out certainly the appellant <NAME> would have been entitled to an acquittal because the occurrence could not have taken place much later than though the exact time of the occurrence is not known But the indication in the evidence is that it took place at about As the burden of proving this special defence of alibi has not been discharged appellant <NAME> case stands on the same footing as that of the other appellant But even so the burden of proving the case against the appellants was on the prosecution irrespective of whether or not the accused have made out a plausible defence The case for the prosecution against the appellants rests on the testimony as already indicated of Ws On the face of it therefore there is no question of law involved and no grounds for interference have been made out in special appeal But it has been argued by the learned counsel for the appellants with his usual vehemence that <ORG> did not act upon the testimony of those four witnesses in so far as it acquitted two of four accused namely <NAME> and <NAME> The reasons for the acquittal of those two persons may be stated in the words of <ORG> as follows In regard to the complicity of <NAME> and <NAME> I have some doubt and I think that they must be given the benefit of the doubt Neither <NAME> nor <NAME> had any motive to murder <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> deposed that they saw the four accused from a distance of or karams standing near the dead body of <NAME> and that they had gandasas with them In my opinion the evidence given by <NAME> and <NAME> does not necessarily connect <NAME> and <NAME> with the crime In this connection reliance was placed on behalf of the appellants on the recent decision of this Court dated unreported in the case of <NAME> State of Punjab Since In that case two persons were placed on trial on a charge of murder and convicted by the trial court This Court further observed that the direct testimony against the accused persons was not free from blemish in so far as it appeared from the evidence that the first person who originated the theory of the complicity of the accused in that case was almost a blind person who could not see things particularly at the dead of the night and that the other witnesses who turned up at the alarm had readily accepted the opinion of the first witness that it was the condemned person who had been responsible for the murderous assault Each case has its own peculiar facts and it is therefore always risky to appeal to precedents on questions of fact In the present case <ORG> differentiated the case of the two appellants from that of the other two accused whom it acquitted chiefly on the ground that whereas there was some evidence of motive against the two appellants there was no such evidence against those two acquitted persons On the question of motive the trial court held that it had not been established that the deceased <NAME> had given information to the police leading to the recovery of a pistol from <NAME> the first appellant and his conviction for an offence under the Arms Act brother of the deceased <NAME> had given evidence against the accused in the Arms Act case If that was the only case of animosity between the two families the appellants could have greater reasons to be offended against <NAME> himself But it has repeatedly been pointed out by this Court that where the positive evidence against the accused is clear cogent and reliable the question of motive is of no importance As regards the question who gave which blows to the deceased the prosecution evidence was that after <NAME> fell from the blows of the two appellants all the four accused gave gandasa blows to the fallen man That evidence has been relied upon by the courts below and we do not see any sufficient reasons to go behind that finding
