Writ Petitions Nos and of in each of which there is a single petitioner who challenges the acquisition of his land situated in Coimbatore town The acquisition proceedings were initiated by a notification dated the th of April issued under Sub section of Section of the Land Acquisition Act herein after referred to as the Act Notices of the proposed acquisition were published in conformity with Rule of the rules framed by <ORG> under Section of the Act but no notice thereof was served individually on either of the petitioners and it is contended on their behalf that the acquisition proceedings are void for want of such notices which it was incumbent on the Collector to serve as per instruction contained in paragraph of Standing Order issued by <ORG> That instruction states Besides publishing the notice as prescribed in Rule of the Appendix I the Collector should see that individual notices are served as far as possible on every person known or believed to be interested in the land and to be acquired in the manner prescribed by Sub sections and of Section of the Land Acquisition Act I of Even if it is regarded as an executive instruction it is based on the principle of natural justice that nobody shall be condemned and for that reason also it is binding on the acquisition authorities Each one of these cases was distinguished by <NAME> on the ground that the instruction above extracted was not brought to the notice of the learned Judge who decided the same After hearing learned Counsel for the parties at some length I have begun to entertain doubts and I say so with the utmost respect to <NAME> about the correctness of the decision in <NAME> case although have not formed any definite opinion in that behalf Those lands were notified by <ORG> for compulsory acquisition for a public purpose The notification was published in the official gazette But individual notices were not given to the petitioners The question raised before <NAME> was whether for want of individual notices on the petitioners as persons interested in the lands the subsequent proceedings would be rendered invalid But a contrary view was found expressed in two earlier unreported decisions rendered by learned single Judges of this Court The facts bearing on the question before us are not very much in dispute The Special Deputy <NAME> Land Acquisition Town Planning Coimbatore was named as the authority to discharge the functions of the Collector under the Land Acquisition Act in relation to this acquisition On th April the <ORG> published a declaration in the <ORG> declaring that the lands notified were required for the extension of the municipal school The <NAME> there upon took orders from the <ORG> for acquisition and proceeded to conduct the inquiry into compensation to be awarded to the persons interested in the lands He followed it up by sending notices of the award to such of those persons who were not present at the time he made the award Among the absentees who received notices of the award were <NAME> and <NAME> who are the two writ petitioners before us In the events that happened as narrated above the complaint of the petitioners before us is that proper notice of the acquisition had not been given to them by the <ORG> Their one and only grievance is that the <ORG> did not give them any individual notices informing them about the <ORG> preliminary notification for acquisition Their complaint before us is that there by they had been deprived of the opportunity of objecting to the acquisition at the right moment and of availing themselves of the inquiry held by the <ORG> In the counter affidavits filed in this Court on behalf of <ORG> and <ORG> there is no denial of the allegation in the writ petition that the petitioners were not served with any individual notices of acquisition immediately following the preliminary notification by the <ORG> in the <ORG> Nor do the records which we had an opportunity to peruse at the hearing show that any such notices were addressed by the <ORG> to the writ petitioners or for that matter to any of the other persons interested in the lands in question It may therefore be taken as a fact that apart from public notices no individual notices were given to the petitioners informing them about the <ORG> preliminary notification It was pointed out that the public notices in response to which some of the persons interested had filed their objections must be held to be adequate notice under the law to all the persons concerned including the petitioners The further question is whether the acquisition proceedings would be invalid if such individual notices were not given to the persons interested in the land The answer to these questions must be found first in the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act Section of the Act which is the pertinent provision in this regard is in the following terms Whenever it appears to the appropriate Government that land in any locality is needed or is likely to be needed for a public purpose a notification to that effect shall be published in the Official Gazette and the Collector shall cause public notice of the substance of such notification to be given at convenient places in the locality The appropriate <ORG> must first be satisfied that any land in a given locality is needed actually or potentially for a public purpose The section does not require that even for the initial formation of its opinion that the land is needed for a public purpose the <ORG> should send notices to the owners of the land convene them and listen to their objections It provides that the Collector should cause public notice of the gist of the <ORG> notification in convenient places in the locality He would be failing in his duty if he did not cause public notice to be displayed in convenient places in the locality In the present case as we had earlier pointed out the writ petitioners do not seek to challenge the acquisition proceedings on the score that no public notice was given as required by Section or even on the ground that the public notice as actually given by the Collector fell short of what is contemplated by the section Their grievance is that the Collector did not personally inform them about the <ORG> notification by issuing to them individual notices containing the gist of the <ORG> decision to acquire the lands in question for a public purpose It does not impose on the Collector any other positive duty in regard to notice of the <ORG> <ORG> notification Sub section of Section deals with the next step in the procedure for compulsory acquisition and it begins with these words Thereupon it shall be lawful for any officer etc There are other indications too in Section to the same effect The sub Section provides that on the publication of the <ORG> preliminary notification in the <ORG> and the Collector public notices in the locality the <ORG> may authorise any of its officers to enter upon and purvey the lands in the locality and to do any acts necessary to ascertain whether the land notified for acquisition for the avowed public purpose is suitable for that purpose It requires that the notice should be in writing it should be addressed to the occupier it should be served on him personally and it should give him seven days time But short of obtaining the occupier consent the power of entry can be exercised by the officers authorized in that behalf only after service of individual notices on the occupier How the notice on the occupier is to be served is dealt with by Section which provides that in the case of a notice under Section it shall be effected by the officer therein mentioned by delivering or tendering a copy thereof signed by him to the person intended to be served with the notice Section in terms only refers to Section but it is obvious that this reference cannot appertain to any notice under Sub section of that section it can only refer to the notice of intention to enter the premises issued to the owner or occupier of a residential house by officers generally or specially authorized in that behalf by the <ORG> in connection with the proceedings contemplated by Section and the proviso thereto On the terms of Section therefore there can be no scope for assuming that the Collector statutory obligation to publicise the <ORG> preliminary <ORG> notification for acquisition extends to the giving of individual notices to the persons interested in the lands notified for acquisition Section A would accordingly have full force and effect learned Counsel urged that under Section A any person interested in the land notified for compulsory acquisition was at liberty to object to the acquisition and when once he lodges his objections the Collector would be under duty bound to give him an opportunity of being heard learned Counsel proceeded to urge that the opportunity of being heard which Section A conferred could only have meaning and reality if all the persons interested in the land were first made aware of the desire of the <ORG> to acquire the lands learned Counsel referred in this connection to an unreported judgment of <NAME> in <NAME> The Land Acquisition Officer Omalur Salem District No of dated st January The conclusion of the learned Judge was that individual notices to persons aggrieved must be given in every case He observed The very intention of Section A of the Act is to give all persons interested in the land which is subject to the com pulsory process to state their objections and after such objections are received the Land Acquisition Officer is mandatorily obliged to give such an objector an opportunity of being heard either in person or by pleader Section A has three sub sections Under Sub section any person interested in any land which has been notified under Section is at liberty to object to the acquisition of the land within days after the issue of <ORG> notification Sub section requires that objection shall be made to the Collector in writing It further provides that after the receipt of written objection from any person interested the Collector shall give to him an opportunity of being heard either in person or by pleader It is also provided in the same sub section that the Collector shall himself hear the objections On the conclusion of the inquiry the Collector is to make a report to the Government containing a record of the proceedings and also his recommendations on the objections Any decision that the Government might take on the objections is declared by this sub section to be final According to these provisions a person shall be deemed to be interested in the land who would be entitled to claim an interest in compensation if the land were acquired under the Act Section A no doubt confers on the persons interested a right to object to the acquisition but under Sub section this right has to be exercised by them within days after the preliminary notification under Section The prescription of a time limit in Section A and its computation as of a fixed period after the notification under Section clearly show that the provision deals with a stage subsequent to the stage of notification of the acquisition The person objecting may file his objection on the very next day after the <ORG> publication or on any day falling within a period of days We are satisfied that the right under Section A in content as well as in chronology is a bare right to object to the acquisition Of what use it was asked in argument is a right to object if the person concerned does not know and has no means of knowing that his land has been notified for acquisition This however is mere rhetoric of a kind that a law reformer may properly employ to some purpose on the floor of the <ORG> or in his published writings Mr <NAME> made a reference to the statement of Objects and Reasons set out in the Bill which introduced Section A in the Act in the year According to this statement The object of the Bill is to provide that a local Government shall not declare under Section of the Act that any land is needed for a public purpose unless time has been allowed after the notification under Section for persons interested in the land to put in objection and for such objections to be considered by the local Government It may be observed that while Section A was newly introduced by the Land Acquisition Amendment Act XXXVIII of the provisions of Section relating to notice were not subjected to any amendment whatever the Collector shall cause a public notice of the substance of such notification to be given at convenient places in the locality in which the land is situated and a copy of such notification to be served on the owner and where the owner is not the occupier also on the occupier of the land The said Rule is in the following terms Rule Immediately after the publication of the notification under Section the Collector shall issue a notice stating that the land is needed or is likely to be needed as the case may be for a public purpose and requiring all persons interested in the land to lodge before the Collector within days after the issue of the notification a statement in writing of their objections if any to the proposed acquisition This notice should be published at convenient places in the said locality and copies thereof fixed up in the office of the Collector the Tahsildar and in the nearest Police Station In the course of their judgment the learned Judges observed that Neither Section nor Section A contains any provision for the service of individual notice on any person interested in the land sought to be acquired by a notification under Section They were however referred to Rule framed by the Government of Maharashtra It was to the following effect Whenever any notification under Section has been published but the provisions of the section have not been applied and the Collector has under Section issued notice to the parties interested and on or before the last day fixed by the Collector in those notices in this behalf any objection is lodged under Section A Firstly the Collector shall record the objection in his proceedings secondly the Collector shall consider whether the objection is admissible according to these rules Before the learned Judges there was no dispute that this rule formed part of the statutory rules made by the State Government in exercise of its powers under Section of the Act and hence it had the force of law Proceeding to construe the rule the learned Judges held that the words the Collector has under Section issued notices to the parties interested clearly indicated that individual notice should be given to all the parties interested in the land Since such notices were not given to the writ petitioners before them the learned Judges quashed the proceedings So far as the relevant Rule in force in this State is concerned we have no doubt whatever that it does not envisage or contemplate much less expressly provide that individual notices shall be addressed to all the persons interested in the land in addition to the publication of notices in prominent places in the locality This Rule provided that the Collector while conducting an inquiry under Section A of the Act must also issue notice of the hearing to the <ORG> at whose instance the land was proposed to be acquired It was argued that Rule was not mandatory and if it was it would be against the provisions of Section A which invested the Collector with a complete discretion in the matter of conducting the inquiry his only statutory obligation being that he should serve the notice of the inquiry on the persons who had lodged their objections We do not see how this decision can be relied on as authority for the position that the persons interested in the land must be given individual notices of the intended acquisition While Section and Rule are obviously intended to facilitate objections to be lodged by the persons interested in the subject matter of the acquisition neither Section nor Rule contemplates that the Collector should serve individual notices on the persons interested in the lands Under the scheme of Section A the question of sending individual notices to persons hardly arises until the proceedings reach a stage when objections are actually lodged with the Collector and an inquiry into these objections has to be gone into by him It follows therefore that for the purposes of seeing whether or not the initial notices of acquisition should be served individually on all the persons interested in the land we would not have to be searching the provisions of Section A or of the relevant rules bearing on Section A but have to look only to Section and Rule for the purpose Mr <NAME> then pressed before us the contention that notwithstanding the absence of any specific provision in the Act or in the Rules in force in this State for sending individual notices of acquisition to persons interested in the land at the stage of proceedings under Section of the Act such notices must be given even at that particular stage since they are required to be given under executive instructions issued to the officers concerned by the State Government Paragraph of the circular states as under The statutory rules framed under the Act require that immediately after the publication of the notification under Section the Collector shall issue a notice calling on all persons interested in the land to prefer in writing their objections if any to the acquisition The notice should be published at convenient places in the locality and copies thereof should be affixed to the notice boards in the offices of the Collector and <ORG> and in the nearest Police Station But the lays down the following further instructions The notice should also be served individually on every person known or believed to be interested in the land to be acquired in the manner prescribed by Sub sections and of Section It is this last passage on which Mr <NAME> places strong reliance It appears that in the notification under Section the name of <NAME> figured as the owner of a particular item of land which was included in the subject matter of acquisition Their contention was that the Collector was bound to serve individual notices on them of the inquiry under Section A giving them an opportunity to object to the acquisition considering that he knew that they were the real owners of the land which had been notified by the <ORG> for acquisition Before <NAME> reliance for the petitioners was mainly placed on <ORG> Standing Order No which in turn was based on No Revenue dated th February issued by the State <ORG> portions of which we have set out earlier in this judgment The <ORG> Standing Order is to be found at page of the Land Acquisition Manual and it contains inter alia the following instructions Besides publishing the notice as prescribed in Rule of the Appendix the Collector should see that the individual notices are served as far as possible on every person known or believed to be interested in the land to be acquired in the manner prescribed by Sub sections and of Section of the Land Acquisition Act I of The learned Judge noticed that for exercise by the <ORG> of its rule making power under Section there were certain requirements to be fulfilled and formalities to be observed in order that the Rules may acquire the force of law The learned Judge recognised the legal position that a <ORG> Standing Order or an executive direction by the <ORG> cannot be equated to a statutory rule made by the <ORG> under Section Nevertheless the learned Judge took the view that the instructions contained in the and the <ORG> Standing Order had statutory force According to the learned Judge the instructions issued by the <ORG> and <ORG> and incorporated in the Land Acquisition Manual could not be dismissed as those emanating from a superior official to a subordinate official On these reasonings the learned Judge held that any violation of the instructions contained in the <ORG> Standing Orders would give rise to a cause of action to a person aggrieved and this Court would have jurisdiction to interfere under Article of the Constitution In this view of the matter on the admitted fact that the petitioners were not given individual notices of the acquisition the learned Judge quashed all the proceedings in that case subsequent to the notification under Section of the Act With respect we do not subscribe to the view of <NAME> The <ORG> Standing Order No on which the learned Judge relied forms part of the Land Acquisition Manual prepared by <ORG> It is divided into many sections Paragraph in Section contains the relevant instructions that besides publishing the notice as prescribed in Rule the Collector should see that individual notices are served as far as possible on every person known or believed to be interested in the land to be acquired Neither the <ORG> Standing Order nor any other part of the Land Acquisition Manual indicates under what authority these instructions had been issued to the Collectors and other officers functioning under the Land Acquisition Act It appears from the preamble to the Regulation that prior to the establishment of Courts of judicature in the Presidency for administering justice in all cases civil and criminal it was usual for <ORG> to exercise judicial authority in the determination of certain cases of a civil nature by way of appeals from the Collectors Who were entrusted with the administration of revenue and dispensation of justice in their respective districts Accordingly Sections and of the Regulation enacted the duties of <ORG> and its powers of superintendence and control of persons employed in the executive administration of revenues Section of the Regulation enacts that <ORG> shall be responsible that the executive officers employed under them discharge the duties of their respective stations with assiduity and for that purpose the <ORG> shall require the officers to pay ready and implicit obedience to all its orders and regulations To the same end the <ORG> was empowered to punish at its discretion any neglect on the part of such officers Its powers of superintendence and control are limited to the persons employed in the executive administration of public revenue and even those powers only relate to the control of the executive administration of revenue under the appropriate regulations We have not come across any piece of legislation in which <ORG> has been given any powers as respects proceedings or officers under the Land Acquisition Act As for the Land Acquisition Act itself it is quite remarkable that in all its various provisions there is not a single place in which the <ORG> gets so much as a passing mention The authorities exercising powers and functions under the Land Acquisition Act are three in number but <ORG> is not one of them The Collector for purposes of the Land Acquisition Act may be either the District Collector or any other officer specially appointed to perform the functions of a Land Acquisition Collector The first piece of legislation for compulsory acquisition of land was the Bengal Regulation I of which was applied with some modification to the Presidency of Madras for the first time by Act XX of At no point in the evolution of the statute law relating to land acquisition in this country has the <ORG> <ORG> of Revenue figured as an authority entrusted by the statute with any powers or duties or functions connected with compulsory acquisition of land for public purposes His order was confirmed in appeal by the District Collector The person aggrieved against the <ORG> decision filed a civil suit to set aside the <ORG> orders One of the questions raised in the suit was whether <ORG> had jurisdiction to interfere with the orders passed by the Revenue Divisional Officer and the District Collector under the Madras Hereditary Village Offices Act Under the scheme of the Madras Hereditary Village Offices Act whenever there was a vacancy to an hereditary office the Collector shall fill up that vacancy and that any dissatisfied claimant shall have the remedy of a suit before the Collector to establish that he had a better right The learned Judge observed as follows The only power which can be claimed by <ORG> is based on Section of <ORG> Regulation I of whereby <ORG> is given authority to superintend and control all persons employed in the executive administration of the public revenue But I am emphatically of opinion that these general powers of superintendence did not authorise <ORG> to arrogate to itself a power of interference in revision or in second appeal from a statutory order when machinery of the statute itself confers no such power The learned Judge further observed thus In my opinion the order of <ORG> purporting to act in second appeal or revision and to decide a matter which according to the machinery of the Act should have been decided by a suit under Section of Act III of was an illegal attempt to invade the vested rights of the plaintiff The learned Judge however proceeded to observe But nontheless the instructions have statutory force In our opinion the only force that executive instructions can have or hope to have is executive force they cannot have legislative or statutory force He relied rather on the order passed by <ORG> in No <ORG> dated th February relevant portions of which we have extracted and set out in an earlier part of this judgment Can the instructions issued by the <ORG> have statutory force The answer to our minds must be in the negative This Gazette Order is published at page of the Manual and is as under Rules have been framed under Section of the Land Acquisition Act prescribing the procedure to be adopted to give full effect to the spirit of the amending Act and these have the force of law i The instructions contained in Part III including No Revenue dated th February are not rules framed by <ORG> in exercise of its powers under Section ii The instructions have no legal force But under the peculiar terms of Section which <NAME> carefully noted even instructions issued by the <ORG> for the guidance of officers can have validity only if they are promulgated in the form of statutory rules following the procedure and formalities laid down in Section What the <ORG>s say of a statute is the law by which is meant not only that it is binding on all authorities entrusted with the task of administering the statute but also that the <ORG> interpretation can be got over only by legislative amendment Even the officers of the <ORG> cannot excuse themselves from <ORG> interpretation by the protest that they are bound under the departmental discipline to obey their superior instructions It may be observed that whenever a question is raised before the <ORG> on a matter of statutory interpretation not only is the <ORG> not bound by any executive instructions on the subject but the <ORG> will not even be swayed by the consideration that any action of an executive authority has been done under the colour of the authority of those instructions In our considered opinion <ORG> literature on land acquisition procedure cannot be relied upon by the petitioners to support their contention that the acquisition proceedings in this case are invalid because they were not served with individual notices of acquisition immediately following the <ORG> notification under Section It was contended by <ORG> that the order was purely an administrative direction and it did not confer any justifiable right on the official in question such as could be enforced by the issue of a mandamus by the <ORG> It was in that context that <ORG> observed thus To say that an administrative order can never confer any right would be too wide a proposition There are administrative orders which confer rights and impose duties We do not think that the above decision of <ORG> on the construction of Service Rules and instructions can have application to a case like the present where the questions are i whether <ORG> can have locus standi to issue guidelines to officers functioning as independent statutory authorities and ii whether the Government could issue rules for guidance otherwise than under Section Besides their Lordships have themselves expressly stated in the above decision that We should not be understood as laying down any general proposition on this question The next major contention of the learned Counsel for the petitioners is that even if the <ORG> Standing Order No or the <ORG> instructions in the Manual were to be held non statutory yet the omission of the Special Tahsildar to give individual notices to the writ petitioners and the other persons interested was in violation of the rules of natural justice and on this account the subsequent proceedings taken by him must be held to be void The question was whether the recommendations of <ORG> for recruitment to the posts in Junior and Senior Scales in <ORG> was vitiated by the circumstance that the name of one of the members of <ORG> itself figured in the list of persons to be considered for selection It was urged before the <ORG> on behalf of the <ORG> that principles of natural justice would not apply to purely administrative decisions The <ORG> however repelled this argument holding that the observance of rules of natural justice extended to administrative decision making as well But we do not understand the decision to lay down that even in cases where the statute elaborately deals with not only the powers and functions of an administrative agency but also the particular procedures that that agency should follow in proceedings within its cognizance the principles of natural justice should be freely applied to test the procedural validity of the action taken by the administrative agency That this was not the broad result intended is shown by the following observations of the <ORG> What particular rule of natural justice should apply to a given case must depend to a great extent on the facts and circumstances of that case the framework of the law under which the inquiry is held and the constitution of the <ORG> or body of persons appointed for that purpose The question of the applicability of the rules of natural justices cannot in our opinion be judged de hors the provisions of the statute and this position is made clear by <ORG> in the above passage Earlier in this judgment we have subjected the relevant provisions of the Land Acquisition Act relating to notice of acquisition to detailed scrutiny Our analysis of Section supplemented by reference to the proviso to Section read with Section and to Section A by way of contrast shows that the omission in the Act to provide for individual notices could not have been accidental There are other provisions too such for instance as Sections and which point to the same conclusion Wherever it was felt necessary and just to give individual notices the <ORG> had made clear and specific provision therefor wherever it was felt that public notice would more than meet the needs having regard to the stage of the acquisition the need for expedition and the requirements of public purpose itself the <ORG> has stopped short with providing for public notice It is also clear that the right to object to the acquisition conferred by Section A on the persons interested in the land can be taken away in any case of urgency by the <ORG> making a direction under Section to the effect that the provisions of Section A shall not apply to the land in question Under the said Rule the Collector was to inquire into any application made by a company to the <ORG> for acquisition of any land for its purpose The Rule explicitly made provision for hearing by the Collector of the company in question and also of representations from other Departments of <ORG> The rule however contained no provision for any opportunity to be given at that stage to the owners of the land sought to be acquired for the purpose of the company Even though the rule in question was silent regarding the mode of inquiry to be held by the Collector <ORG> yet held that in the interest of fair play the Collector has to observe the principles of natural justice by affording the persons interested in the lands reasonable opportunity of being heard and of adducing material before the Collector to refute the allegations of the company Our understanding of the above decision is that while the Rule contemplated an inquiry to be made by the Collector since the procedure for holding the inquiry was not fully laid down the principles of natural justice could very well be inducted into the Rule for determining what the lawful requirements of the inquiry should be We do not think that the above decision of <ORG> has any application to Section We have earlier shown how on its own terms as well as in comparison with other provisions in the Act the public notice contemplated under Section must be regarded as exhaustive of the mode of notice We may refer in this connection to a recent decision of <ORG> in <NAME> <ORG> as to the proper approach that a Court of law must take whenever natural justice is invoked for the purpose of supplementing express statutory provisions Lord <NAME> delivering the judgment of the <ORG> quoted from a decision of <ORG> in <NAME> Municipality of St Leonards the following passage as relevant The <ORG> has addressed itself to the very question and it is not for the <ORG> to amend the statute by engrafting upon it some provision which the <ORG> might think more consonant with a complete opportunity for an aggrieved person to present his views and to support them by evidentiary material Reference was also made to the judgment of Lord <NAME> in <NAME> <NAME> A and in particular to the following passage in that judgment at page Natural Justice requires that the procedure before any <ORG> which is acting judicially shall be fair in all the circumstances For a long time the <ORG> have without objection from <ORG> supplemented procedure laid down in legislation where they have found that to be necessary for this purpose In our view the Land Acquisition Act is a piece of legislation wherein is to be found not merely the policy of the <ORG> to acquire lands for public purpose but also the means for giving effect to such a policy Having ascertained those means effect must be given to those means and to no other The observations were made in a different context while considering a different statutory situation but we feel that they are apposite to the present purpose Under our system of <ORG>ary Government what <ORG> enacts are not policies but means for giving effect to policies In construing the enacting words he may take account of what the Act discloses as the purpose that those means were intended to achieve and in the case of ambiguity alone he may interpret them in the sense in which they are more likely to promote than hinder its achievement But it is no function of a Judge to add to the means which <ORG> has enacted in derogation of rights which citizens previously enjoyed at common law because he thinks that the particular case in which he has to apply the Act demonstrates that those means are not adequate to achieve what he conceives to be the policy of the Act It represents the price by way of deprivation of freedom to do or not to do as the wish which <ORG> is prepared to exact from individual citizens to promote those objects to which the Act is directed For the reasons stated above we do not feel persuaded to imply in the provisions of Section and Section A of the Act the necessity for issuing individual notices to persons aggrieved promoted by consideration of natural justice The learned Judge had referred in his judgment to two earlier decisions of learned single Judges of this Court both of them unreported <NAME> <NAME> felt that neither decision laid down the law correctly and in that view felt free to differ from them As we shall show presently the views expressed in the two unreported decisions eminently merit acceptance both on principle and on precedent The earlier of the two unreported decisions arose in a case where the owner contended that there was no proper publication of the notification under Section of the Act It was further contended that the property notified for acquisition was under mortgage and the Collector should have given notice personally to the mortgagee Dealing with the latter contention <NAME> <NAME> observed Regarding the contention that there was no proper notice to the petitioner or to <ORG> it has to be mentioned that neither Section nor Section contemplates service of any personal notice on the owner or occupier of the land that is sought to be acquired Elaborating the theme at a later part of the judgment it was observed as follows The plea of the learned Counsel for the petitioner that Section read with Section contemplates service of notices on the person in occupation or interested in the property cannot be accepted for there is no mention of service of any personal notice under Section What is contemplated under Section is that service of any notice under this Act shall be made by delivering or tendering a copy thereof signed in the case of a notice under Section by the officer therein mentioned The proviso to Section states that no person shall enter any building without giving the occupier at least seven days notice in writing of his intention to do so The comment of <NAME> on the above decision is that there was no consideration by the learned Judge of the executive instructions and the Board Standing Orders bearing on the subject of notice under Section We have earlier expressed the view that those instructions have no legal efficacy On the terms of Section the views expressed in the above unreported judgment are those with which we fully agree But there is nothing in the form to suggest that the notice in that form should actually be issued to each and every one of the persons interested in the land However much the language of Form can be strained it cannot in our opinion lead to the inference that notice in that form must be sent to all the persons interested in the land The last submission made by the learned Counsel for the petitioners relates to a subsequent stage of the acquisition proceedings namely the stage of what is popularly termed as the award inquiry Section deals with notices to persons interested It provides that the Collector shall give public notice at convenient places on or near the land to be taken stating that the Government intends to take possession of the land and that claims to compensation for all interests in such land may be made to him Section requires that the public notice shall state the particulars of the land so needed and shall require all persons interested in the land to appear personally or by agent before the Collector at a time and place mentioned therein and to state the nature of the interest in the land and the amount and particulars of their claim to compensation for such interests as well as their objections if any to the measurements Section contemplates that individual notices must be served on the occupier of the land and on all persons known or believed to be interested in the land Sub section provides that in the event of any such person residing elsewhere and having no agent in residence at the locality then the notice will have to be sent to him by registered post addressed to It further says that whenever practicable service of the notice shall be made on the persons therein named But when such person cannot be found service may be made on any adult male member of his family residing with him and if no such adult male member can be found the notice may be served by affixing the notice on the outer door of the house in which the person therein named ordinarily dwells or carries on business or by affixing a copy thereof in some conspicuous place in the office of the Collector or in the Court house and also in some conspicuous part of the land to be acquired He states that notices under Sections and of the Land Acquisition Act and and were published and served on all the interested persons in accordance with the Statute In so far as the petitioner <NAME> in No of is concerned it is stated that since she was out of Coimbatore the notice under Section was served by affixture <NAME> in her affidavit in support of her Writ Petition No of states that the land which is the subject matter of acquisition in No Oppanakkara Street Coimbatore Town is owned by persons being herself her three sisters her five brothers and her mother all of whom are entitled to the property as co heirs of her father <NAME> in his affidavit in No of states that No of Oppanakkara Street Coimbatore Town in which he is interested as a co owner belongs to his family consisting of members namely the petitioner father the petitioner his brother and four sisters We are satisfied that the services of notices under Section read with Section have been validly made on the petitioner on the basis of their own affidavits in support of the writ petitions It was argued that the house in question was not her residence but this cannot be accepted in the face of the admission made by her in the affidavit that whenever she visited Coimbatore she used to stay in the house and a portion in the house was specially reserved for such stay A person can have more than one ordinary residence and service of notice at any one of the residences would be good service under Section read with Section It would be appreciated that the contentions raised by the petitioners are all in the nature of mere procedural wrangles Perhaps because the petitioners have no case on merits they have been hard put to it to raise technical contentions concerning notice service etc
