Sub section provides for payment to such a seller a the price agreed upon consistently with the controlled price if any fixed under the section the price calculated with reference to the controlled price if any and where none of these applies a price calculated at the market rate prevailing in the locality at the date of the sale Subsection A deals with orders made with a view to controlling the rise in prices or preventing the hoarding of any foodstuff in any locality and determination of price for payment to the seller notwithstanding anything contained in sub Sub section lays down that where any producer is required by an order made with refer ence to cl of sub to sell any kind of sugar and either no notification in respect of such sugar has been issued under sub A or any such notification having been issued has ceased to remain in force by efflux of time then notwithstanding anything contained in sub there shall be paid to that producer an amount therefore which shall be calculated with reference to such price of sugar as <ORG> may by order determine having regard to a the minimum price if any fixed for sugarcane by <ORG> under this section the manufac turing cost of sugar the duty or tax if any paid or payable thereon and the securing of a reasonable return on the capital employed in the business of manufacturing sugar and different prices may be determined from time to time for different areas or for different factories or for different kinds of sugar The <ORG> by notifications dated th November and th July issued in exercise of the power under sub The petitioners owners of sugar mills operating in the State of Uttar Pradesh in areas classified for the purpose of determining the price of levy sugar as West and East zones challenged the validity of the said orders on the grounds that they were ultra vires the Act and violative of their fundamental rights as the prices of levy sugar had been determined arbitrarily with reference to the average cost profiles of factories grouped together in zones without regard to their individual capacity and cost characteris tics that although the <ORG> has the discretion to fix different prices for different areas or for different facto ries or for different kinds of sugar such wide discretion has to be reasonably exercised that the words having regard to occurring in sub is a mandatory require ment demanding strict compliance with clauses a to that the ingredients of the said clauses should therefore have been examined with reference to each producer as a condition precedent to the determination of the price of sugar that <ORG> had not applied its mind to the relevant questions to which they were expected to have regard to in terms of thesub section and that the expression determine used in sub section indicates that the order to which that expression referred to is quasi judicial amenable to judicial review For the respondents it was contended that the division of the country into zones and the method adopted by the <ORG> in fixing price of levy sugar was fully supported by the recommendations of various expert bodies and <ORG> and was upheld in <ORG> Agri cultural Industrial Society Ltd <ORG> SCR that the cost of manufacturing sugar depends not only on recovery from the sugarcane duration of crushing season crushing capacity of the plant the sugarcane price paid and the capital em ployed but also to a considerable extent on the conditions of the plant and machinery quality of management invest ment policy relations with cane growers and labour finan cial reputation etc that to group together factories having a high cost profile and to determine a price special ly applicable to them is to put a premium on incompetence if not mismanagement and that the orders determining the price of sugar in terms of sub section were of general application and therefore legislative in character and the omission if any to consider the peculiar problems of individual producers was not a ground of judicial review The notifications dated th November and th July issued under sub There is no merit in the challenge Sub section is attracted whenever any producer is required to sell sugar by an order made with reference to sub and no notification has been issued under sub A or any such notification having been issued has ceased to be in force The words having regard to in sub are the legislative instruction for the general guidance of the <ORG> in determining the price of sugar In considering the reasonableness of the order made by the <ORG> in exercise of its power under sub the <ORG> will not strictly scrutinise the extent to which matters mentioned in cls a to or any other matters have been taken into account by the <ORG> in making its estimate of the price In the instant case the material brought to the notice of the <ORG> does not support the arguments at the bar that <ORG> had not applied its mind to the relevant questions to which they were expected to have regard in terms of the statute Where an authority to whom power is delegated is entitled to sub delegate his power be it legislative executive or judicial then such authority may also give instructions to his delegates and these instructions may be regarded as legislative It affects the rights of individuals in the abstract When the function is treated as legislative a party affected by the order has no right to notice and bearing unless of course the statute so requires The orders in the instant case duly published in the official gazettes notifying the prices determined for sugar of various grades and produced in various zones and applicable without exception to all producers failing within well defined groups can be legitimately characterised as legislative It is with reference to predetermined prices of sugar that subsection postulates the calculation of the amount payable to each producer who has sold sugar in compliance with an order made with reference to cl of sub Any Act of the repository of power whether legisla tive or administrative or quasi judicial is open to chal lenge if it is in conflict with the Constitution or the governing Act or the general principles of the law of the land or it is so arbitrary or unreasonable that no fair minded authority could ever have made it Such clas sification cannot in the absence of evidence to the con trary be characterised as arbitrary or unreasonable or not rounded on an intelligible differentia having a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved by sub section Such matters do not ordinarily attract the power of judicial review Prices are determined with reference to the geographical cum agro economic considerations and the aver age cost profiles of factories located in their respective zones The petitioners contend that these orders are ultra vires the Act and violative of their fundamental fights as the prices of levy sugar have been determined arbitrarily with reference to the average cost profiles of factories grouped together in zones without regard to their individual capacity and cost characteristics The method adopted by the <ORG> in fixing the price of levy sugar is fully sup ported by the recommendations of various expert bodies The cost of manufacturing sugar the respondents con tend depends not only on recovery from the sugarcane duration of crushing season crushing capacity of the plant the sugarcane price paid and the capital employed as stated by the petitioners but also to a consider able extent on the condition of the plant and machinery quality of management investment policy relations with cane growers and labour financial reputation etc Mr <NAME> appearing for the petitioners does not object to the factories being grouped together on the basis of factors common to them with a view to fixing the prices applicable to them as a class of producers There are sugar factories in the country and the present intervener has members Besides there are members with the cooperative sector Mr <NAME> submits that the present case is squarely covered by the decisions of this Court in <ORG> etc He says that the petitioners have not made out a case for reconsideration of these two decisions In the report of <ORG> it was pointed out that the Government had actually fixed the prices for zones which meant that from four zones the number had been increased to twenty two or more but these reasons have no relation to the zonal system That system by and large has led to efficiency and provides an incentive to cut down the cost The contention of the producers that they have been incurring losses on ac count of the zonal system is opposed to the evidence pro duced by them The Court has rejected the extreme contention that prices should be fixed unitwise i on the basis of actual cost incurred by each unit There is abundant justification for continuing and sustaining the zonal system Even if there is no price control the uneconomic units would be at a great disadvantage The <ORG> states Even if there is no price control each unit will have to compete in the market and those units which are uneconomic and whose cost is unduly high will have to compete with others which are more efficient and the cost of which is much lower The fair price has to be deter mined with reference to the conditions of a representative cross section of the industry For all these reasons there is ample justification in continuing and sustaining the zonal system for the purpose of price fixation There is no discrimination in the classification of zones on a geographical cum agro economic consideration and any such classification is perfectly consistent with the principle of equality a determination by the <ORG> of the price of sugar and payment of an amount to the manufacturer and states that the concept of fair price which is what is referred to in sub section as price of sugar does not by any account mean the actual cost of production of every individual manufacturer He states The basis of a fair price would have to be built on a reasonably efficient and economic representative crosssec tion on whose workings cost schedules would have been worked out and the price to be determined by Government under sub section would have to be built The floor price of cane fixed by Government was intended to protect the farmer from ex ploitation but that was found not to be an incentive enough to induce him to increase his acreage A device had to be found under which a price higher than the minimum could be paid by the manufacturer of sugar The consumer on the other hand had also to be protected against the spiralling of sugar price and his needs growing as they were had to be satisfied at some reasonable price This is what he states Both these and a larger production of sugar would not be possible unless there was a reasonable return which would ensure expansion which again would not be possible unless new machinery for such expansion was brought in and facto ries particularly in and Bihar were modernised and renovated There is great force in the submission of the respond ents that to group together factories having a high cost profile and to determine a price specially applicable to them is as recognised by this <ORG> in Panipat supra and Anakapalle supra to put a premium on incompetence if not mismanagement The history of control over sugar has been set out at length in Panipat supra and we do not wish to burden this judgment with a narration of the circumstances which have led to the introduction of partial control under which of the output of sugar is acquired and the balance left for free sale For an illuminating discussion of this aspect See <NAME> Price Policy Lancer International provisions of that sub section under which the impugned notification have been issued we shall refer to the statu tory scheme The entire Act is devoted to the cause of the general public with a view to achieving equitable distribution of essential commodities at fair prices Powers to control production supply distribution etc of essential commodities If <ORG> is of opinion that it is necessary or expedient so to do for maintaining or increasing supplies of any essential commodity or for securing their equitable distribution and availability at fair prices or for securing any essential commodity for the defence of India or the efficient conduct of military operations it may by order provide for regu lating or prohibiting the production supply and distribu tion thereof and trade and commerce therein With larger receipts they offered in the following season a higher price to the farmer the sugarcane grower who in turn grew and offered more cane One of them is what is contained in clause of sub section which empowers <ORG> to require any person dealing in any essential commodity to sell the whole or a specified part of such commodity to <ORG> or <ORG> or to a nominee of such Government It reads Without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred by sub section an order made thereunder may provide a for requiring any person holding in stock or engaged in the production or in the business of buying or selling of any essential commodity a to sell the whole or a specified part of the quantity held in stock or produced or received by him or in the case of any such commodity which is likely to be produced or received by him to sell the whole or a speci fied part of such commodity when produced or received by him to <ORG> or <ORG> or to an officer or agent of such Government or to a Corporation owned or controlled by such Government or to such other person or class of persons and in such circumstances as may be specified in the order An order is defined under section to include a direction issued thereunder This subsection oper ates only where an order has been made under sub section with reference to clause of sub section While clause a of the sub section postulates an agreed price consistently with the controlled price if any clause speaks of a price calculated with reference to the con trolled price if any when no agreement is reached Where neither clause a nor clause applies either because there is no agreement or because there is no controlled price the seller has to be paid as per clause a price calculated at the market rate prevailing in the locality at the date of the sale Sub section A empowers <ORG> to regulate in accordance with the provisions of the sub sec tion the price of any foodstuff sold in a locality in com pliance with an order made with reference to clause of sub section The power to issue the direction is notwithstanding anything contained in sub section Any such notifica tion will remain in force for any specified period not exceeding months The price payable in such cases is either the agreed price consistently with the controlled price if any or where no such agreement is possible the price calculated with reference to the controlled price if any or where neither of these two methods is applicable the price calculated with reference to the average market rate prevailing in the locality during the period of months immediately prior to the date of the notification The average market rate will be determined by an officer authorised by <ORG> and the rate so deter mined by him is not liable to be questioned in any court Where any producer is required by an order made with reference to clause of sub section to sell any kind of sugar whether to the Central Government or a State Government or to an officer or agent of such Govern ment or to any other person or class of persons and either no notification in respect of such sugar has been issued under sub section A or any such notification having been issued has ceased to remain in force by efflux ot time then notwithstanding anything contained in sub section there shall be paid to that producer an amount therefore which shall be calculated with reference to such price of sugar as the Central Government may by order determine having regard to a the minimum price if any fixed for sugarcane by <ORG> under this section the manufacturing cost of sugar the duty or tax if any paid or payable thereon and the securing of a reasonable return on the capital employed in the business of manufacturing sugar and different prices may be determined from time to time for different areas or for different factories or for different kinds of sugar Explanation For the purposes of this sub section produc er means a person carrying on the business of manufacturing sugar emphasis supplied Sub Section is attracted whenever any producer is required to sell sugar by an order made with reference to sub section and no notification has been issued under sub section A or any such notification having been issued has ceased to be in force What is payable under sub sectin is an amount calculated with reference to the price of sugar determined in the manner indicated in that sub sec tion The sub section lays down two conditions which must exist before it applies The first is that there must be an order made with reference to sub section cl and the second is that there is no notification under sub section A or if any such notification has been issued it is no longer in force owing to efflux of time Next the words notwithstanding anything contained in sub section suggest that the amount payable to the person required to sell his stock of sugar would be with reference to the price fixed under the subsection and not the agreed price or the market price in the absence of any controlled price under sub sec The sub section then lays down two things firstly that where a producer is required by an order with reference to sub sec to sell any kind of sugar there shall be paid to that producer an amount therefore that is for such stock of sugar as is required to be sold and secondly that such amount shall be calculated with reference to such price of sugar as <ORG> may by order determine having regard to the four factors set out in cls The price of sugar must be determined by the Central Govern ment having regard to the factors mentioned in clauses a to of sub section In contradistinction to the price of sugar the amount is calculated with reference to the particular seller What is contemplated by the legislature in dele gating such wide discretion to <ORG> is that it must apply its mind to the manifold questions rele vant to the determination of prices and with due regard to the norms laid down in the sub section Referring to the legislative background of sub section this <ORG> in Panipat supra observes In order to appreciate the meaning of cls a and it must be remembered that ever since control on sugar was imposed <ORG> had set up expert committees to work out cost schedules and fairprices Starting in the beginning with an All India cost schedule worked out on the basis of the total production of sugar the factories were later grouped together into zones or regions and different cost schedules for different zones or regions were con structed on the basis of which fair prices were worked out at which sugar was distributed and sold <ORG> in and <ORG> in had worked out the zonal cost schedules on the basis of averaged recovery and duration the minimum and not the actual price of cane the averaged conversion costs and recommended a reasonable return on the capital employed by the industry in the business of manufacturing sugar The legislature therefore incorporated the same formula in the new sub section as the basis for working out the price The purpose behind enacting the new sub section was three fold to provide an incentive to increase production of sugar encourage expan sion of the industry to devise a means by which the cane producer could get a share in the profits of the industry through prices for his cane higher than the minimum price fixed and secure to the consumer distribution of at least a reasonable quantity of sugar at a fair price Clauses a to of sub section postulate that the price of sugar must be determined having regard to the minimum price if any fixed for sugarcane by the Central <ORG> the manufacturing cost of sugar the duty or tax applicable in the zone and the securing of a reasonable return on the capital employed in the business of manufac turing sugar Referring to clause of sub section this <ORG> observes in Panipat supra It is clear from the reports of <ORG> that a reasonable return recommended by that body at a fixed amount of Rs per quintal which worked out in at per annum was not in respect of levy sugar only but on the whole so that even if such a return was not obtain able on levy sugar but was obtainable on the whole it would meet the requirement of cl In this conclusion we derive a two fold support firstly from the language used in cl itself viz a reasonable return on the capital employed in the business of manufacturing sugar which must mean the business as a whole and not the business of manu facturing levy sugar only and secondly from the fact of the <ORG> having all along used the same phraseology while recommending Rs per quintal as an addition by way of a reasonable return on the capital employed in the industry The cost schedules prepared by these bodies were for determining a fair price in relation to the entire sugar produced by the industry and the return which should be granted to it on the capital employed in the industry and not with respect to that stock only required to be sold under sub sec The petitioners contend that although the Government has the discretion to fix different prices for different areas or for different factories or for different kinds of sugar such wide dis cretion has to be reasonably exercised The petitioners further contend that the Act requires the <ORG> to have regard to clauses a to and therefore it is mandatory on the part of the <ORG> to act strictly in compliance with the provisions of those clauses in determining the prices Be that as it may the expression having regard to must be understood in the context in which it is used in the stat ute These words do not mean that the Government cannot after taking into account the matters mentioned in clauses a to consider any other matter which may be relevant The Government must of course address itself to the questions to which it must have regard and having done so it is for the Government to determine what it is empowered to determine with refer ence to what it reasonably consider to be relevant for the purpose A observed with reference to the expression having regard to The form of words used no doubt lends itself to the sugges tion that regard should be paid only to the two matters mentioned but it appears to their Lordships that it is impossible to arrive at a conclusion as to reasonableness by considering the two matters mentioned isolated from other relevant factors Moreover the statute does not say having regard only to losses previously incurred by the company and to the smallness of the profits made In <NAME> <NAME> it was held by <ORG> to quote a few words from the judgment of <NAME> at page All that clause means is that the tribunal assessing the compensation is to bear in mind and have regard to the average weekly wages earned before and after the accident respectively Cozens Hardy observed at page No mandatory words are there used the phrase is simply regard may be had Under the phrase Regard may be had to the facts which the <ORG> may thus take cognizance of are to be a guide and not a fetter This <ORG> speaking through one of us <NAME> as he then was has expressed the same opinion in the case of <ORG> Union of India SCR Says the learned Judge at page The expression having regard to only obliges the <ORG> to consider as relevant data material to which it must have regard SCC one of us <NAME> as he then was observed The expression having regard to only obliges the govern ment to consider as relevant data material to which it must have regard Ltd All at Lord <NAME> stated A certain amount of discussion took place in argument as to the meaning of having regard to in The words having regard to in the sub section are the legislative instruction for the general guidance of the <ORG> in determining the price of sugar The reasona bleness of the order made by the <ORG> in exercise of its power under sub section will of course be tested by asking the question whether or not the matters mentioned in clauses a to have been generally considered by the <ORG> in making its estimate of the price but the Court will not strictly scrutinise the extent to which those matters or any other matters have been taken into account There is sufficient compliance with the sub section if the <ORG> has addressed its mind to the factors mentioned in clauses a to amongst other factors which the <ORG> may reasonably consider to be relevant and has come to a conclusion which any reasonable person placed in the position of the <ORG> would have come to On such determination of the price of sugar which as stated in Panipat supra is the fair price the sub section postu lates the calculation of an amount with reference to such price for payment to each producer who has complied with an order made with reference to sub section The Attorney General submits that orders determining the prices of sugar in terms of the sub section are of general application and therefore legislative in character They submit that the sub section contemplates only administrative or quasi judicial orders of particular application and the impugned orders are not legislative <NAME> points out that legislative power is the power to prescribe the law for people in general while administra tive power is the power to prescribe the law for them or apply the law to them in particular situations He asks And what of directions of a general character given by a minister to a nationa lised industry Are these various orders legislative or administrative <NAME> says that the correct Comd there is an infinite series of gradations with a large area of overlap between what is plainly legislation and what is plainly administration where a Minister or other authority is given power in a statute or an instrument to exercise executive as opposed to legislative powers as for example to requisition property or to issue a licence and delegates those powers generally then any instructions which he gives to his delegates may be legisla tive Where an authority to whom power is delegated is entitled to sub delegate his power be it legislative executive or judicial then such authority may also give instructions to his delegates and these instructions may be regarded as legislative Justice <NAME> definition which is what is called the time test and which <NAME> describes as one which has produced many unsatisfactory practical results reads A judicial inquiry investigates declares and enforces liabilities as they stand on present or past facts and under laws supposed already to exist Legislation on the other hand looks to the future and Ibid changes existing conditions by making a new rule to be applied thereafter to all or some part of those subject to its power In the words of Chief Justice <NAME> rule making is normally directed toward the formulation of requirements having a general application to all members of a broadly identifiable class <NAME> says an adjudication on the other hand applies to specific individuals or situations When the function is treated as legislative a party affected by the order has no fight to notice and heating unless of course the statute so re quires In the case of subordinate legislation it may happen that Parlia ment may itself provide for a notice and for a hearing But where the legislature has not chosen to provide for any notice or hearing no one can insist upon it and it will not be permissible to read natural justice into such legislative activity It is true that with the proliferation of delegated legislation there is a tendency for the line between legislation and administration to vanish into an illusion Administrative quasi judicial decisions tend to merge in legislative activity and con versely legislative activity tends to fade into and present an appearance of an administrative or quasi judicial activi ty Stating that rule making is of general application to all members of a broadly identifiable class while adjudication is applicable to specific individuals or situations the learned Judge observes A price fixation measure does not concern itself with the interests of an individual manufacturer or producer It is intended to operate in the future It is conceived in the interests of the general consumer public The right of the citizen to obtain essential articles at fair prices and the duty of the <ORG> to so provide them are transformed into the power of the <ORG> to fix prices and the obligations of the producer to charge no more than the price fixed The learned Judge emphasises Price fixation may occasionally assume an administrative or quasi judicial character when it relates to acquisition or requisition of goods or property from individuals and it becomes necessary to fix the price separately in relation to such individuals Such situations may arise when the owner of property or goods is compelled to sell his property or goods to the government or its nominee and the price to be paid is directed by the legislature to be determined accord ing to the statutory guidelines laid down by it In such situations the determination of price may acquire a quasiju dicial character These observations have been cited with approval by one of <ORG> <NAME> as he then was in Renusagar supra In <ORG> <ORG> SCR at this Court states Price fixation is more in the nature of a legislative measure even though it may be based upon objective criteria found in a report or other material It could not there fore give rise to a complaint that a rule of natural jus tice has not been followed in fixing the price price fixation is made a quasi judicial function for specified purposes or cases it is really legislative in character in the type of control order which is now before us because it satisfies the tests of legislation A legisla tive measure does not concern itself with the facts of an individual case It is meant to lay down a general rule applicable to all persons or objects or transactions of a particular kind or class The impugned orders duly published in the official gazettes notifying the prices determined for sugar of var ious grades and pro duced in various zones and applicable to all producers of such sugar can in our view be legitimately characterised as legislative The notified prices are applicable without exception to all persons falling within well defined groups It is with reference to such predetermined prices of sugar that the amount payable to each producer who has sold sugar in compliance with an order made with reference to clause of sub section is calculated It would appear that what the learned Judge had in mind was an order by which the amount was calculated in terms of sub section in respect of each individual producer and not an order determining the price of sugar We therefore understand the observation of the learned Judge on this point as applicable only to the individual order fixing the amount in terms of the sub section and not to orders determining the price of sugar which are what the impugned orders are SCR equality and arbi trariness are sworn enemies one belongs to the rule of law in a republic while the other to the whim and caprice of an absolute monarch If they are manifestly unjust or oppressive or outra geous or directed to an unauthorised end or do not tend in some degree to the accomplishment of the objects of delegation courts might well say Parlia ment never intended to give authority to make such rules they are unreasonable and ultra vires The doctrine of judicial review implies that the reposi tory of power acts within the bounds of the power delegated and he does not abuse his power He must act reasonably and in good faith When that finding is found to be rational and reasonably based on evidence in the sense that all relevant material has been taken into account and no irrelevant material has influenced the deci sion and the decision is one which any reasonably minded person acting on such evidence would have come to then judicial review is exhausted even though the finding may not necessarily be what the <ORG> would have come to as a trier of fact As stated by Lord <NAME> of <ORG> in Chief Constable of <ORG> <NAME> WLR at The function of the court is to see that lawful authority is not abused by unfair treatment and not tO attempt itself the task entrusted to that authority by the law The purpose of judicial review is to ensure that the indi vidual receives fair treatment and not to ensure that the authority after according fair treatment reaches on a matter which it is authorised by law to decide for itself a conclu sion which is correct in the eyes of the court It is well settled that a public body invested with statutory powers such as those conferred upon the <ORG> must take care not to exceed or abuse its pow ers It must keep within the limits of the authority commit ted to it It must act in good faith Even if the statutory order is passed in good faith and with the best of intention to further the purpose of the legislation which confers the powers since the <ORG> has to act in accordance with and within the limits of that legislation its order can also be challenged if it is beyond those limits or is passed on grounds extra neous to the legislation or if there are no grounds at all for passing it or if the grounds are such that no one can reasonably arrive at the opinion or satisfaction requisite under the legislation In any one of these situations it can well be said that the authority did not honestly form its opinion or that in forming it it did not apply its mind to the relevant facts In Renusagar SCC Mukharji as he then was states The exercise of power whether legislative or administrative will be set aside if there is manifest error in the exercise of such power or the exercise of the power is manifestly arbitrary Similarly if the power has been exercised on a non consideration or non application of mind to relevant factors the exercise of power will be regarded as manifestly erroneous If a power whether legislative or administra tive is exercised on the oasis of facts which do not exist and which are patently erroneous such exercise of power will stand vitiated The true position therefore is that any act of the repository of power whether legislative or administrative or quasi judicial is open to challenge if it is in conflict with the Constitution or the governing Act or the general principles of the law of the land or it is so arbitrary or unreasonable that no fair minded authority could ever have made it The impugned orders are undoubtedly based on an exhaus tive study by experts material brought to our notice by the petitioners does not support the arguments at the bar that <ORG> has not applied its mind to the relevant questions to which they are expected to have regard in terms of the statute Such classifica tion as held in Panipat supra and Anakapalle supra cannot in the absence of evidence to the contrary be characterised as arbitrary or unreasonable or not rounded on an intelligible differentia having a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved by subsection The person assailing such classification carries the heavy burden of making a convincing showing that it is invalid because it is unjust and unreasonable in its consequences <ORG> <ORG> US SCC at We do not agree with the basic premises that price fixation primarily affects manufacturers and producers It is for their protection that price fixation is resorted to and any increase in price affects them as seriously as any decrease does a manufacturer if not more The <ORG> in exercise of judicial review is not concerned with the correctness of the findings of fact on the basis of which the orders are made so long as those findings are reasonably supported by evidence When we consider the limit ing conditions of litigation the adaptability of the judi cial process only to issues definitely circumscribed and susceptible of being judged by the techniques and criteria within the special competence of lawyers it is clear that the Due Process Clause does not require the feel of the expert to be supplanted by an independent view of judges on the conflicting testimony and prophecies and impressions of expert witnesses In all such cases judicial in quiry is confined to the question whether the findings of fact are reasonably based on evidence and whether such findings are consistent with the laws of the land The court only examines whether the price determined was with due regard to considerations provided by the statute And wheth er extraneous matters have been excluded from determination Such matters do not ordinarily attract the power of judicial review We would in this connection recall the words of <NAME> in Secretary of Agriculture etc Even if it is true that the petitioners as individuals are at a disadvantage and have suffered losses on account of the present system an assertion which has not been established and which by its very nature is incapable of determination by judicial review that is not sufficient ground for inter ference with the impugned orders We are not satisfied that the decisions of this <ORG> in Anakapalle SCR and Panipat SCR require reconsideration in any respect We see no merit in the challenge against the im pugned orders However we do not make any order as to costs
