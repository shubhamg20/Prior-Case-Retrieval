tions whether mandatory Disregard of if invalidates disciplinary action Authorities empowered to take action If exercise Powers of Governor Police Act of Proceedings under of the Police Act were taken against the respondent on the charge of misappropriation of Rs and he was dismissed from service by an order of the Deputy Inspector General of Police The respondent filed a writ petition before <ORG> challenging the order of the dismissal on the ground that the authorities had acted in violation of Rule I of Para This rule required that every information received by the police relating to the commission of a cognizable offence by a Police Officer shall be dealt with in the first place under Ch XIV Code of Criminal Procedure The appellant contended i that the complaint did not make out any cognizable offence against the respondent and I of Para enabled the authorities to initiate departmental proceedings without complying with the provisions of I iii that the Police Regulations made in exercise of the power conferred on the Government under the Police Act delegating the power of the Governor to dismiss at pleasure to a subordinate officer were only administrative directions for the exercise of the pleasure in a reasonable manner and any breach of the regulations did not confer any right or give a cause of action to the public servant and iv that the regulations were only directory and the non compliance with the rules did not invalidate the order of dismissal The facts alleged in the complaint made out a cognizable offence under Indian Penal Code against the respondent and the provisions of I of Para ii The power to dismiss a public servant at pleasure was outside the scope of Art iv <ORG> or <ORG> could not make a law abrogating or modifying this tenure

content of the doctrine of reasonable opportunity embodied in Art vii If a statute could be made by <ORG> within the foregoing permissible limits the rules made by an authority in exercise of the power conferred thereunder would likewise be efficacious within the said limits Any authority taking action under the Police Act or the rules made thereunder must conform to the provisions thereof and if there was any violation of those provisions the public servant had a right to challenge the order of the authority if the rules were mandatory Paragraph of the Police Regulations was mandatory and not directory rules governing disciplinary proceeding could not be treated as administrative directions but had the same effect as the provisions of the statute whereunder they were made in so far as they were not inconsistent with the provisions thereof The provisions of para were merely directory and a non compliance therewith did not invalidate the disciplinary action taken against the respondent All public servants other than those excepted expressly by the Constitution held office during the pleasure of the President or the Governor and no law or rule framed under Art The Police officers held office during the pleasure of the Governor and the only protection they could claim was the two guarantees contained in Art The procedural rules could be of two kinds i those that prescribed the manner in which the guarantee contained in Art The officers specified in of the Police Act were exercising the powers of the Governor to dismiss at pleasure and their powers were subject to the same limitations to which the Governor was subject or by the existing law which must be treated as analogous to a law under Art the officer exercising the power of dismissal was only indirectly exercising the Governor power to dismiss at pleasure Paragraph was not meant for the purpose of carrying out the object of Art and could not be mandatory and could not add a further fetter on the exercise of the power to dismiss at the pleasure of the Governor over and above the fetters contained in Art was delivered by <NAME> SUBBA RAO This is an appeal by special leave against the judgment of <ORG> at Allahabad Lucknow Bench allowing the petition filed by the respondent under Art The respondent was appointed a Sub Inspector of Police in December and was posted at Sitapur in June There is dispute in regard to the interpretation of the complaint On receipt of the said complaint <NAME> made enquiries and issued a notice to the respondent to show cause why his integrity certificate should not be withheld upon which the respondent submitted his explanation on October Thereafter <NAME> forwarded the file of the case to the Deputy Inspector General of Police Central Range who directed <NAME> to take proceedings under of the Police Act against the respondent The departmental proceedings were started against the respondent on November a charge sheet was served upon the respondent under of the Police Act stating that there were strong reasons to suspect that the respondent misappropriated a sum of Rs On January the Superin tendent of Police issued another notice to the respondent to show cause why he should not be reduced to the lowest grade of Sub Inspector for a period of three years In due course the respondent showed cause against the action proposed to be taken against him on a consideration of which <NAME> Sitapur by his order dated January reduced the respondent to the lowest grade of Sub Inspector for a period of three years When this order came to the notice of <ORG> on a consideration of the entire record he came to the con clusion that the respondent should be dismissed from service and on October he made an order to that effect On February the Inspector General of Police confirmed that order and the revision filed by the respondent against that order to <ORG> was also dismissed in August Thereafter the respondent filed a petition under Art On that finding they quashed the impugned orders with the result that the order dismissing the respondent from service was set aside The State Government the Deputy Inspector General of Police Lucknow and the Inspector General of Police Uttar Pradesh Lucknow have preferred the present appeal against the said order of <ORG> We shall now proceed to consider the various contentions raised by learned counsel in the order they were raised and argued before us At the outset Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the appellants contended that there was no breach of the provisions of para If this contention be accepted no other question arises in this case therefore we shall deal with the same In such cases and in other cases until and unless a magisterial inquiry is ordered inquiry will be made under the direction of the Superintendent of Police in accordance with the following rules I Every information received by the police relating to the commission of a cognizable offence by a police officer shall be dealt with in the first place under Chapter XIV Criminal Procedure Code according to law a case under the appropriate section being registered in the police station concerned This provision expressly lays down that every information received by the police relating to the commission of a cognizable offence by a police officer shall be dealt with in the first place under Ch XIV of the Criminal Procedure Code Learned counsel contends that the information received in the present case does not relate to any offence committed by the respondent much less to a cognizable offence This is a point raised before us for the first time This does not find a place even in the statement of case filed by the appellants In <ORG> it was not contended that the information did not disclose any offence committed by the respondent Indeed it was common case that the information disclosed an offence committed by the respondent but it had been contended by the appellants that the misappropriation of the part of the money amounted to an offence under of the Indian Penal Code which is not a cognizable offence and it was argued on behalf of the respondent that it amounted to an offence under of the Indian Penal Code The learned judges accepted the contention of the respondent Even so it is said that whatever might been the contentions of the parties the information given by <NAME> to <NAME> clearly disclosed that no offence was alleged to have been committed by the respondent and that this Court would therefore be justified even at this very late stage to accept the contention of the appellants The facts alleged make out an offence against both the Sub Inspector as well as <NAME> The mere fact that the respondent is not shown as one of the opposite parties in the application does not affect the question for the information given in the application imputed the commission of an offence to both the respondent and <NAME> The notice issued by the Supe rintendent of Police on November to the respondent also charges him with an offence of misappropriation It is stated that the said notice only says that <NAME> had good reasons to suspect that the respondent misappropriated the sum of money and that it does not aver that he committed the offence of misappropriation But what matters is that <NAME> also understood from the information given and the enquiry conducted by him that the respondent had committed the offence In the counter affidavit filed by <NAME> on behalf of the State it was clearly averred that on September <NAME> appeared before him and filed a petition to the effect fiat one <NAME> and the respondent had misappropriated a sum of Rs In the circumstances we must hold that the information received by the police related to the commission of an offence by the respondent It is said that there was no entrustment made by <NAME> to the respondent and that therefore the offence did not fall under of the Indian Penal Code which is a cognizable offence but only under of the Indian Penal Code which is not a cognizable offence Section of the Indian Penal Code defines criminal breach of trust and thereof prescribes the punishment for the criminal breach of trust by a public servant Under of the Indian Penal Code Whoever being in any manner entrusted with property or with any dominion over property dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use that property or dishonestly uses or disposes of that property in violation of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be discharged or of any legal contract express or implied which he has made touching the discharge of such trust or wilfully suffers any person so to do commits criminal breach of trust The person entrusted may misappropriate it himself or he may wilfully suffer another person to do so In these circumstances there cannot be any difficulty in holding that the currency notes were alleged to have been handed over by <NAME> to the respondent for a specific purpose but were dishonestly misappropriated by the respondent or at any rate he wilfully suffered <NAME> to misappropriate the same If so the information discloses a cognizable offence We reject the first contention offence including an offence under of the Police Act and III to an offence under of the Police Act or a non cognizable offence including an offence under of the Police Act Rule III says When a Superintendent of Police sees reason to take action on information given to him or on his own knowledge or suspicion that a police officer subordinate to him has committed an offence under section of the Police Act or a non cognizable offence including an offence under section of the Police Act of which he considers it unnecessary at that stage to forward a report in writing to the District Magistrate under rule II above he will make or cause to be made by an officer senior in rank to the officer charged a departmental inquiry sufficient to test the truth of the charge Section of the Police Act empowers certain officers to dismiss suspend or reduce any police officer of the subordinate rank whom they shall think remiss or negligent in the discharge of his duty or unfit for the same The commission of such offences may also be a ground to hold that an officer is unfit to hold his office Action under this section can therefore be taken in respect of i offences only under of the Police Act without involving any cognizable or noncognizable offences that is simple remissness or negli gence in the discharge of duty ii cognizable offences and iii non cognizable offences Though the word only is not mentioned in rule the offence under of the Police Act can in the context mean an offence only under of the said Act i an offence falling under the first category We therefore reject this contention The third contention advanced by learned counsel for the appellants raises a constitutional point of considerable importance But if there is a statute prescribing the terms of service and the mode of dismissal of the servant of the <ORG> the statute would control the pleasure of the <ORG> In India the Constitution as well as the earlier Constitution Act of as amended in and embodied the incidents of tenure at pleasure of His Majesty or the President or the Governor as the case may be but did not empower the Legislatures under the earlier Acts and the <ORG> and the Legislatures under the Constitution to make a law abrogating or modifying the said tenure therefore any law made by appropriate authorities conferring a power on any subordinate officer to dismiss a servant must be construed not to limit the power of His Majesty the President or the Governor as the case may be but only to indicate that they would express their pleasure only through the said officers The rules made in exercise of a power conferred on a <ORG> under a statute so delegating the power to a subordinate officer can only be administrative directions to enable the exercise of the pleasure by the concerned authorities in a reasonable manner and that any breach of those regulations cannot possibly confer any right on or give a cause of action to the aggrieved <ORG> servant to go to a court of law and vindicate his rights Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the respondent in countering this argument contends that the constitution Acts in India embodied the incidents of the tenure of the <ORG> pleasure in the relevant provisions and what the <ORG> can do in England the appropriate <ORG> in India also can do that is the tenure at pleasure created by the Constitution Act can be abrogated limited or modified by law enacted by the appropriate legislative bodies Alternatively he contends that even if the Police Act does not curtail the tenure at pleasure the <ORG> validly made that law and the <ORG> validly made statutory rules in exercise of the powers confered under that Act and that therefore the appropriate authorities can only dismiss the respondent in strict compliance with the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder That section was substituted by the present section in and later on some appropriate amend ments were made to bring it in conformity with the Constitution We shall deal with the Regulations at a later stage This Act was repealed by the Government of India Act and the section corresponding to was in the latter Act The main difference between the Act of and that of was that in the former Act there was only one limitation on the <ORG> pleasure namely that no person in the service might be dismissed by an authority subordinate to that by which he was appointed whereas in the latter Act a second limitation was imposed namely that no such person should be dismissed or reduced in rank until he had been given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him see sub ss Until other provision is made in this behalf under this Constitution all the laws in force immediately before the commencement of this Constitution and applicable to any public service or any post which continues to exist after the commencement of this Constitution as an all India service or as service or post under the <ORG> or a <ORG> shall continue in force so far as consistent with the provisions of this Constitution The relevant provisions of the Constitution read thus Article Subject to the provisions of this Constitution Acts of the appropriate <ORG> may regulate the recruitment and conditions of service of persons appointed to public services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union or of any <ORG> Provided that it shall be competent for the President or such person as he may direct in the case of services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union and for the Governor of a <ORG> or such person as he may direct in the case of services and posts in connection with the affairs of the <ORG> to make rules regulating the recruitment and the conditions of service of persons appointed to such services and posts until provision in that behalf is made by or under an Act of the appropriate <ORG> under this article and any rules so made shall have effect subject to the provisions of any such Act Article Except as expressly provided by this Constitution every person who is a member of a defence service or of a civil service or holds any post connected with defence or any Civil Post under the Union holds office during the pleasure of the President and every person who is a member of a civil service of a <ORG> or holds any civil post under a <ORG> holds office during the pleasure of the Governor of the <ORG> the appropriate <ORG> may regulate the recruitment and conditions of service of persons appointed to public services every person who is <ORG> member of a public service described therein holds office during the pleasure of the President or the Governor as the case may be restrictive clause namely Subject to the provisions of this Constitution and if there is no restrictive clause in Art is subject to the provisions of Art with the result that the power of the <ORG> to lay down the conditions of service of persons appointed to public services would be subject to the tenure at pleasure under Art If there is a specific provision in some part of the Constitution giving to a Government servant a tenure different from that provided for in Art and which provide that the Judges of <ORG> the Auditor General the Judges of the High Courts and the Chief Election Commissioner shall not be removed from their offices except in the manner laid down in those Articles to the provisions of the Constitution which empower other authorities to make rules relating to the conditions of service of certain classes of public servants namely Arts That may be so but there is no reason why Art In England all servants of the <ORG> hold office during the pleasure of the <ORG> the right to dismiss at pleasure is an implied term in every contract of employment of the <ORG> this doctrine is not based upon any prerogative of the <ORG> but on public policy if the terms of appointment definitely prescribe a tenure for good behaviour or expressly provide for a power to determine for a cause such an implication of a power to dismiss at pleasure is excluded and an Act of Parliament can abrogate or amend the said doctrine of public policy in the same way as it can do in respect of any other part of common law Section of the Government of India Act for the first time in by amendment statutorily recognized this doctrine but it was made subject to a condition or qualification namely that no person in that service might be dismissed by any authority subordinate to that by which he was appointed Section of the Act of imposed another limitation namely that a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in i A regard to a person must be given to him He referred inter alia to Entry of List I and Entry of List II It is not disputed that <ORG> can make law for the organization of the police and for the prevention and detection of crime thereof nothing in this Article shall prevent <ORG> or the <ORG> of the State from conferring by law functions on any authority subordinate to the Governor The argument is that a power to terminate the service at pleasure under Art the <ORG> or the <ORG> of the State can confer the same power on any authority subordinate to the Governor or at any rate can make a law prescribing that the Governor shall exercise the said pleasure through a particular officer We cannot agree either with the premises or the conclusion sought to be based on it Article speaks of the executive power of the <ORG> vesting in the Governor it does not deal with the constitutional powers of the Governor which do not form part of the executive power of the <ORG> Article says that subject to the provisions of the Constitution the executive power of the <ORG> shall extend to matters with respect to which the <ORG> of the <ORG> has power to make laws If the <ORG> of the <ORG> has no power to make a law affecting the tenure at pleasure of the Governor the said power must necessarily fall outside the scope of the executive power of the <ORG> Doubtless the Governor may have to exercise the said power whenever an occasion arises in the manner prescribed by the Constitution but that in itself does not make it a part of the executive power of the <ORG> or enable him to delegate his power it does not make any difference in the legal position so far as the present case is concerned Article of the Constitution says that unless expresssly provided by the Constitution to the contrary every civil servant holds office during the pleasure of the Governor subject to the limitations prescribed under Art expressly provides for a different tenure Can it be said that the said Article confers on the <ORG> or the <ORG> a power higher than that conferred on them under Art of the Constitution It only preserves the power of the <ORG> which it has under the Constitution to make a law conferring functions on an authority subordinate to the Governor It is then said that if the appellants contention were not accepted it would lead to conflict of jurisdiction while the Governor has the power under Art to dismiss a public servant at his pleasure a statute may confer a power on a subordinate officer to dismiss a servant only subject to conditions a subordinate officer functioning under an Act may not be able to dismiss a servant but the Governor may be able to do so under similar circumstances a subordi nate officer may dismiss a servant but the Governor may order his continuance in office A law made by the appropriate <ORG> or the rules made by the President or the Governor as the case may be under the said Article may confer a power upon a particular authority to remove a public servant from service but the conferment of such a power does not amount to a delegation of the Governor pleasure Whatever the said authority does is by virtue of express power conferred on it by a statute or rules made by competent authorities and not by virtue of any delegation by the Governor of his power basis for unlike in England a member of the public service in India is constitutionally protected at least in two directions i he cannot be dismissed by an authority subordinate to that by which he was appointed ii he cannot be dismissed removed or reduced in rank until he has been given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him These two statutory protections to the Government servant are now incorporated in Art This Article imposes two qualifications on the exercise of the pleasure of the President or the Governor and they quite clearly restrict the operation of the rule embodied in Art The most important of these two limitations is the provision prescribing that a civil servant shall be given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him The appropriate <ORG> and <ORG> can test the validity of such a law on the basis whe ther the provisions prescribed provide for such an opportunity and if it is valid to ascertain whether the reasonable opportunity so prescribed is really given to a particular officer The discussion yields the following results In India every person who is a member of a public service described in Art The power to dismiss a public servant at pleasure is outside the scope of Art This tenure is subject to the limitations or qualifications mentioned in Art The <ORG> or the <ORG> of States cannot make a law abrogating or modifying this tenure so as to impinge upon the overriding power conferred upon the President or the Governor under Art The <ORG> or the <ORG> of States can make a law regulating the conditions of service of such a member which includes proceedings by way of disciplinary action without affecting the powers of the President or the Governor under Art The <ORG> and the <ORG> also can make a law laying down and regulating the scope and content of the doctrine of reasonable opportunity embodied in Art If a statute could be made by <ORG> within the foregoing permissible limits the rules made by an authority in exercise of the power conferred thereunder would likewise be efficacious within the said limits Presumably they were also made by the Government in exercise of its power under of the Police Act Rules made under a statute must be treated for all purposes of construction or obligation exactly as if they were in the Act and are to be of the same effect as if contained in the Act and are to be judicially noticed for all purposes of construction or obligation see <NAME> On the Interpretation of Statutes th edn It follows that where the appropriate authority takes disciplinary action under the Police Act or the rules made thereunder it must conform to the provisions of the statute or the rules which have conferred upon it the power to take the said action If there is any violation of the said provisions subject to the question which we will presently consider whether the rules are directory or mandatory the public servant would have a right to challenge the decision of that authority Under of the said Act every person in civil service holds office during the pleasure of His Majesty Sub section of that section empowers the Secretary of <ORG> for India to make rules laying down among others the conditions of service and sub declares that no rules so made shall be construed to limit or abridge the power of the Secretary of <ORG> in <ORG> to deal with the case of any person in the civil service of the <ORG> in India in such manner as may appear to him to be just and equitable Two reasons were given for the conclusion namely i in express terms stated that the office was held during the pleasure and there was no room for the implication of a contractual term that the rules were to be observed and ii sub of and the rules made careful provisions for redress of grievances by administrative process and that sub reaffirmed the superior authority of the Secretary of <ORG> in <ORG> over the civil service It may be noticed that the rules framed in exercise of the power conferred by the Act was to regulate the exercise of His Majesty pleasure The observations were presumably coloured by the doctrine of tenure at pleasure obtaining in England namely that it could only be modified by statute influenced by the princi ple that the rules made under a statute shall be consistent with its provisions and what is more based upon a construction of the express provisions of the Act The appeal was heard along with that in <NAME> case and the judgments in both the appeals were delivered on the same day <ORG> distinguished <NAME> case with the following observations at It is manifest that the stipulation or proviso as to dismissal is itself of statutory force and stands on a footing quite other than any matters of rule which are of infinite variety and can be changed from time to time These observations do not carry the matter further an our remarks made in connection with <NAME> case would equally apply to this case This Court in <NAME> case incidentally noticed the observations of <ORG> in <NAME> case and observed that the rules which were not incorporated in a statute did not impose any legal restriction upon the right of the <ORG> to dismiss its servants at pleasure <NAME> if we may say so correctly stated the scope of the rule in <NAME> case in the decision in <NAME> case when he stated at The position of the Government servant was therefore rather insecure for his office being held during the pleasure of the <ORG> under the Government of India Act the rules could not override I A or derogate from the statute and the protection of the rules could not be enforced by action so as to nullify the statute itself These decisions and the observations made therein could not be understood to mark a radical departure from the fundamental principle of construction that rules made under a statute must be treated as exactly as if they were in the Act and are of the same effect as if contained in the Act There is another principle equally fundamental to the rules of construction namely that the rules shall be consistent with the provisions of the Act The decisions of <ORG> on the provisions of the earlier Constitution Act can be sustained on the ground that the rules made in exercise of power conferred under the Acts cannot override or modify the tenure at pleasure provided by or of the said Acts as the case may be Therefore when the paramountcy of the doctrine was conceded or declared by the statute there might have been justification for sustaining the rules made under that statute in derogation thereof on the ground that they were only administrative directions for otherwise the rules would have to be struck down as inconsistent with the Act So long as the statute and the rules made thereunder do not affect the power of the Governor in the present case the Governor pleasure is expressly preserved they should be legally enforceable It would not serve any purpose to consider every one of them in detail They express two divergent views one line relies upon the observations of <ORG> in <NAME> case and lays down that all statutory rules vis a vis the disciplinary proceedings taken against a <ORG> servant are administrative directions and the other applies the well settled rules of construction and holds that the appropriate authority is bound to comply with the mandatory provisions of the rules in making an inquiry under a particular statute the rules governing disciplinary proceedings cannot be treated as administrative directions but shall have the same effect as the provisions of the statute whereunder they are made in so far a they are not inconsistent with the provisions thereof We have already negatived the contention of learned counsel that the Governor exercises his pleasure through the officers specified in of the Police Act and therefore it is not possible to equate the Governor pleasure with that of the specified officers statutory power If so it follows that the inquiry under the Act shall be made in accordance with its provisions and the rules made thereunder Then learned counsel contends that even if the said rules have statutory force they are only directory and the non compliance with the rules will not invalidate the order of dismissal made by the appropriate authority Before we consider the principles governing the question whether the rules are mandatory or directory it would be convenient at this stage to notice broadly the scope and the purpose of the inquiry contemplated by the rules punish specified subordinate officers who are remiss or negligent in discharge of their duties or unfit for the same enables the Government to make rules to regulate the procedure to be followed by the magistrate and police officers in discharge of any duty imposed on them by or under the Act under read with of the Police Act the Police Regulations embodied in chapter XXXII were framed Paragraph of the Regulations says that the rules in that chapter have been made under of the Police Act and apply only to officers appointed under of the Police Act and that no officer appointed under that section shall be punished by executive order otherwise than in the manner provided in that chapter Paragraph gives the procedure to be followed in the matter of the inquiry against a police officer It reads Subject to the special provision contained in paragraph and to any special orders which may be passed by the Governor in particular cases a proceeding against a police officer will consist of A A magisterial or police inquiry followed if this inquiry shows the need for further action by A judicial trial or A departmental trial or both consecutively Paragraph reads When a magisterial inquiry is ordered it will be made in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Code and the Superintendent of Police will have no direct concern with it until the conclusion of judicial proceedings or until and unless the case is referred to him for further disposal but he must give any assistance to the inquiring magistrate that he may legally be called upon to give and he must suspend the accused should this become necessary under paragraph Paragraph says that there can be no magisterial inquiry under the Criminal Procedure Code when the offence alleged against a police officer amounts to an offence only under of the Police Act and it provides further that in such cases and in other cases until and unless a magisterial inquiry is ordered inquiry will be made under the direction of the Superintendent of Police in accordance with the rules given thereunder Under rule I thereof Every information received by the police relating to the commission of a cognizable offence by a police officer shall be dealt with in the first place under Chapter XIV Criminal Procedure Code according to law a case under the appropriate section being registered in the police station concerned There are six provisos to that rule Rule II provides for the inquiry of a non cognizable offence and rule III prescribes the procedure in regard to an offence only under of the Police Act or a non cognizable offence of which the Superintendent of Police considers unnecessary at that stage to forward a report in writing to the District Magistrate There are other provisions dealing with the manner of conducting the inquiries and other connected matters In the case of cognizable offences the Superintendent of Police is directed to investigate under chapter XIV of the Criminal Pro cedure Code and in the case of non cognizable offences in the manner provided in rule II of para and in the case of an offence only under of the Police Act or a non cognizable offence in the manner provided under rule III of para The word shall in its ordinary import is obligatory but there are many decisions wherein the courts under different situations construed the word to mean may It is then observed They the rules are well known and there is no need to repeat them But they are all of them only aids for ascertaining the true intention of the legislature which is the determining factor and that must ultimately depend on the context The meaning and intention of the legislature must govern and these are to be ascertained not only from the phraseology of the provision but also by considering its nature its design and the In Craies on Statute Law th edition the following passage appears at No universal rule can be laid down as to whether mandatory enactments shall be considered directory only or obligatory with an implied nullification for disobedience A valuable guide for ascertaining the intention of the <ORG> is found in <NAME> on The Interpretation of Statutes th edition at and it is On the other hand where the prescriptions of a statute relate to the performance of a public duty and where the invalidation of acts done in neglect of them would work serious general inconvenience or injustice to persons who have no control over those entrusted with the duty without promoting the essential aims of the legislature such prescriptions seem to be generally understood as mere instructions for the guidance and government of those on whom the duty is imposed or in other words as directory only The neglect of them may be penal indeed but it does not affect the validity of the act done in disregard of them The relevant rules of interpretation may be briefly stated thus When a statute uses the word shall prima facie it is mandatory but the <ORG> may ascertain the real intention of the legislature by carefully attending to the whole scope of the statute For ascertaining the real intention of the <ORG> the <ORG> may consider inter alia the nature and the design of the statute and the consequences which A <NAME> would follow from construing it the one way or the other the impact of other provisions whereby the necessity of complying with the provisions in question is avoided the circumstance namely that the statute provides for a contingency of the non compliance with the provisions the fact that the non compliance with the provisions is or is not visited by some penalty the serious or trivial consequences that flow therefrom and above all whether the object of the legislation will be defeated or furthered After making the necessary investigation under chapter XIV of the Criminal Procedure Code <NAME> may as well come to the conclusion that the officer concerned is innocent and on that basis drop the entire proceedings From the stand point of the department as well as the officer against whom departmental inquiry is sought to be intiated the preliminary inquiry is very important and it serves a real purpose Here the setting aside of the order of dismissal will not affect the public in general and the only consequence will be that the officer will have to be proceeded against in the manner prescribed by the rules On September he was returning from a village called Madhwapur when he saw a man who was subsequently found to be <NAME> coming from the side of a canal and going hurriedly into a field When he reached his house he found that there was a shortage of Rs He then made a complaint to the Superintendent of Police on September in which he gave the above facts An inquiry was made by the Superintendent of Police and ultimately departmental proceedings under of the Police Act were taken against the respondent The reply of the appellant was two fold in the first place it was urged that did not apply as there was no report of a cognizable offence against the sub inspector and in the next place it was urged that the rules contained in the Police Regulations were only administrative rules and even if there was non compliance with any of them it would not affect the departmental proceedings taken against the respondent provided there was no breach of the guarantees contained in Art <ORG> held that there was a report of a cognizable offence under of the Indian Penal Code against the respondent and therefore the procedure provided by ought to have been followed It further held that had been framed under of the Police Act and was a statutory provision which had the force of law As such following the earlier view taken by <ORG> in two other cases it held that a dismissal as a result of departmental proceedings which took place without complying with would be illegal The appellant then applied for a certificate to enable it to appeal to this <ORG> which was refused Mr <NAME> on behalf of the appellant urges the same two points before us So far as the first point is concerned we are of opinion that there is no force in it There is no doubt that in the complaint made by <NAME> the name of the respondent was not shown in the heading but from the facts disclosed in the body of the complaint it is clear that the sub inspector searched the person of <NAME> and recovered a bundle containing currency notes When therefore he was satisfied that there was no reason to take any further action against <NAME> it was his duty to see that the entire amount taken by him from <NAME> on search was returned to him <NAME> <ORG> was right in the view that where property is taken away with the intention that it will continue to be the property of the person from whose possession it has been taken away there will be an entrustment of the property to the person taking it away and if subsequently the person taking it away converts it to his own use or suffers some other person to do so there will be criminal breach of trust and not merely criminal misappropriation This brings us to the main point in the present appeal of the Police Act under which has been framed is in these terms Subject to such rules as the State Government may from time to time make under this Act the Inspector General Deputy Inspectors General Assistant Inspectors General and District Superintendents of Police may at any time dismiss suspend or reduce any police officer of the subordinate ranks whom they shall think remiss or negligent in the discharge of his duty or unfit for the same or may award any one or more of the following punishments to any police officer of the subordinate ranks who shall discharge his duty in a careless or negligent manner or who by any act of his own shall render himself unfit for the discharge thereof name a fine to any amount not exceeding one month pay confinement to quarters for a term not exceeding fifteen days with or without punishment drill extra guard fatigue or other duty deprivation of good conduct pay removal from any office of distinction or special emolument It gives power to four grades of police officers to dismiss suspend or reduce any police officer of the subordinate ranks whom they think remiss or negligent in the discharge of his duty or unfit for the same It also provides for infliction of four other kinds of punishment by these four grades of officers on any police officer of the subordinate ranks who discharges his duty in a careless or negligent manner or who by any act of his own renders himself unfit for the discharge thereof The contention on behalf of the respondent is that the power of dismissal has to be exercised subject to rules and therefore when of the Police Regulations framed under provided a certain procedure to be followed with respect to cases in which a cognizable offence was involved it was not open to the authority concerned to disregard that procedure That procedural provision is that where a report of a cognizable crime is made against a police officer belonging to the subordinate ranks it has to be registered as provided in Chapter XIV of the Code of Criminal Procedure and investigated as provided thereunder The main contention on behalf of the appellant is that the Rules framed under of the Police Act are administrative rules and in any case they are only directory and non compliance with them would not vitiate the subsequent proceedings unless there is a breach of the guarantee contained in Art of the Constitution as all public servants hold their office at the pleasure of the President or the Governor as the case may be other than those expressly excepted under the Constitution This brings us to a consideration of the tenure on which public servants hold office The position in England is that all public servants hold office at the pleasure of His Majesty that is to say their service was terminable at any time without amuse see <NAME> <NAME> By law however it is open to <ORG> to prescribe a different tenure and the King being a party to every Act of <ORG> is understood to have accepted the change in the tenure when he gives assent to such law see <NAME> <NAME> Section for the first time provided by statute that every person in the civil service of the <ORG> held office during His Majesty pleasure subject to the provisions of the Government of India Act and the rules made thereunder and the only protection to a public servant against the exercise of pleasure was that he could not be dismissed by any authority subordinate to that by which he was appointed It was this section which came for consideration before the Privy <ORG> in <NAME> case and the Privy <ORG> held that in spite of the words limited and special kind during pleasure with an added contractual term that the procedure prescribed by the Rules must be observed it was by the express terms of held during His Majesty pleasure and no right of action as claimed by <NAME> existed <ORG> further held that the terms of assured that the tenure of office though at pleasure would not be subject to capricious or arbitrary action but would be regulated by the rules which were manifold in number most minute in particularity and all capable of change but there was no right in the public servant enforceable by action to hold his office in accordance with those rules and he could therefore be dismissed notwithstanding the failure to observe the procedure prescribed by them The main point which was urged in <NAME> case was that under XIV of the Civil Services Classification Rules no public servant could be dismissed removed or reduced in rank except after a properly recorded departmental inquiry <ORG> further held that in the case before it there had been a serious and complete failure to adhere to important and indeed fundamental rules and mistakes of a serious kind had been made and wrongs had been done which called for redress even so they were of the view that as a matter of law that redress was not obtainable from courts by action In the Government of India Act laid down that except as expressly provided by this Act every person who is a member of a civil service of the <ORG> in India holds office during His Majesty pleasure There were however two safeguards provided by sub ss The first was the same namely that no public servant will be dismissed by an officer subordinate to that who appointed him but a further exception was added to the pleasure tenure namely no public servant shall be dismissed until he has been given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him Thus by the Government of India Act there were two statutory guarantees to public servants against the exercise of the pleasure of his Majesty but it is clear from of the Government of India Act that the pleasure of His Majesty to dismiss was not otherwise subject to rules framed under the subsequent provisions of the Government of India Act appearing in Chapter of Part dealing with public services <NAME> service or of a civil service of the <ORG> or of an all India service or holds any post connected with defence or any civil post under the <ORG> holds office during the pleasure of the President and every person who is a member of a civil service of a <ORG> or holds any civil post under a <ORG> holds office during the pleasure of the Governor of the <ORG> It will be clear therefore that all public servants except as expressly provided by the Constitution hold their office during the pleasure of the President or the Governor as the case may be Article then provides for two guarantees and is similar in terms to and of the Government of India Act and the two guarantees are the same namely i that no person shall be dismissed or removed by an authority subordinate to that by which he was appointed and ii no such person shall be dismissed or removed or reduced in rank until he has been given a reason able opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him He relies on the words as expressly provided by this Constitution and urges that it is open to the legisla ture to cut down the pleasure tenure by law or to provide for its being affected by statutory rules In this connection he relies on Art begins with the words subject to the provisions of this Constitution land lays down that Acts of the appropriate <ORG> may regulate the recruitment and conditions of service of person appointed to public services and posts in connection with the affairs of the <ORG> or of any State lays down that it shall be competent for the President or the Governor as the case may be to make rules relating to recruitment and conditions of service until provision in that behalf is made by or under an Act of the appropriate <ORG> and therefore any law passed or rules framed under Art The words except as expressly provided by this Constitution appearing in Art Therefore unless there is an express provision in the Constitution cutting down the pleasure tenure every public servant holds office during the pleasure of the President or the Governor as the case may be We cannot accept the argument that a law passed under Art or the laws passed thereunder amount to a statutory and solemn assurance that the tenure of office though at pleasure will not be subject to capricious or arbitrary action but will be regulated by rule But if the rules or the law define the content of the guarantee contained in Art they may to that extent be mandatory but only because they carry out the guarantee contained in Art which authorises <ORG> or the legislature of a State to confer functions on any I A If any law is passed conferring on any authority the power to dismiss or remove or reduce in rank that law cannot cut down the content of the pleasure tenure as contained in Art and that article also begins with the words subject to the provisions of this Constitution The position therefore that emerges from the examination of the relevant Articles of the Constitution is that all public servants other than those who are excepted expressly by the provisions of the Constitution hold office during the pleasure of the President or the Governor as the case may be and that no law or rule passed or framed under Art Section thereof lays down that four grades of officers will have power to dismiss suspend or reduce any police officer of the subordinate ranks subject to such rules as <ORG> may from time to time make under the Police Act The police officers of the subordinate ranks are not expressly excluded from the operation of the pleasure tenure by any provision of the Constitution they therefore hold office during the pleasure of the Governor and the only protection that they can claim are the two guarantees contained in Art It was left to the rules to provide which four grades of officers would dismiss police officers of which subordinate rank or would give which punishment to a police officer of which subordinate rank which lays down that no public servant shall be dismissed by an authority subordinate to that by which he was appointed The rules therefore that are framed under would thus be of two kinds namely those which define the jurisdiction of four grades of officers to inflict a particular kind of punishment on a particular police officer of the subordinate rank they will be mandatory for they go to the root of the jurisdiction of the officer exercising the power but even these rules cannot go against the provisions of Art Some of them may prescribe the manner in which the guarantee contained in Art may be carried out and if there are any such rules they will be mandatory The rest will be merely procedural and can only be directory as otherwise if they are also mandatory further fetters on the power of the Governor to dismiss at his pleasure contained in Art Before however we come to itself we may dispose of another argument namely that the four grades of officers who have the power to dismiss under are exercising the statutory authority vested in them and are not exercising the Governor pleasure of dismissal under Art and therefore their action in dismissing an officer is subject to all the rules framed for their guidance Article defines the pleasure tenure and by necessary implication gives power to the Governor to dismiss at pleasure any public servant subject to the exceptions contained in Art Thus it is open to the Governor to delegate his power of dismissal to officers subordinate to him but even when those officers exercise the power of dismissal the Governor is indirectly exercising it through those to whom he has delegated it and it is still the pleasure of the Governor to dismiss which is being exercised by the subordinate officers to whom it may be delegated Further though the Governor may delegate his executive power of dismissal at pleasure to subordinate officers he still retains in himself the power to dismiss at pleasure if he thinks fit in a particular case in spite of the delegation Therefore even where a subordinate officer is exercising the power to dismiss he is indirectly exercising the power of the Governor to dismiss at pleasure and so his power of dismissal can only be subject to the same limitations to which the power of the Governor would be subject if he exercised it directly and that it had been conferred on those police officers by law In our opinion that makes no difference to the nature of the power which is being exercised by these four grades of officers under the Police Act gives power to <ORG> or the legislature of a State by law to confer functions on any authority subordinate to the Governor When the function of dismissal is conferred by law on any authority subordinate to the Governor it is nothing more than delegation of the Governor executive power to dismiss at pleasure by means of law and stands in no better position than a delegation by the Governor himself under Art or by an existing law which must be treated as analogous to a law under Art the officer exercising the power of dismissal is only indirectly exercising the Governor power to dismiss at pleasure and his order of dismissal has the same effect as the order of the Governor to dismiss at pleasure the power of the Governor to dismiss at pleasure indirectly and the only fetters that can be placed on that power are those contained in the Constitution namely Art We may in this connection refer once again to the case of <NAME> where the dismissal was by an officer subordinate to the Governor of Madras but that dismissal was also held to be an indirect exercise I of His Majesty pleasure to dismiss and that is why it was held that if XIV of the Classification Rules was not complied with a public servant had no right of action against an order dismissing him at His Majesty pleasure Therefore whenever a subordinate officer exercises the power to dismiss whether that power is delegated by the Governor or is delegated under a law made under Art or under an existing law analogous to that he is merely exercising indirectly the power of the Governor to dismiss at pleasure and his action is subject only to the two guarantees contained in Art The fact therefore that the police officer in this case made the order of dismissal by virtue of will make no difference and he will be deemed to be exercising the power of the Governor to dismiss at pleasure by delegation to him by law of that power We may add that even where there is delegation by law of the power of the Governor to dismiss at pleasure the power of the Governor himself to act directly and dismiss at pleasure cannot be taken away by that law for that power he derives from Art The present case therefore must be judged on the same basis as any case of dismissal directly by the Governor and would only be subject to the two limitations contained in Art This rule as we have already indicated provides that if there is any complaint of the commission of any cognizable crime by a police officer it must be registered in the relevant police station under Chapter XIV of the Code of Criminal Procedure and investigated in the manner provided by that Chapter or to hold a departmental inquiry or do both though in the last case the departmental inquiry must take place only after the judicial trial is over As we read we cannot see that it is meant for that purpose it only provides for a police investigation under Chapter XIV of the Code of Criminal Procedure The police officer making an investigation under Chapter XIV is not bound to examine the person against whom he is investigating though there is nothing to prevent him from doing so which says that a public servant shall not be dismissed without giving him a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him Therefore not being meant for the purpose of carrying out the object of Art cannot be mandatory and cannot add a further fetter on the exercise of the power to dismiss or remove at the pleasure of the Governor over and above the guarantees contained in Art It appears to us that the object of is that the authority concerned should first make a preliminary inquiry to find out if there is a case against the officer complained against either to proceed in a court or to take departmental action Incidentally it may be that after such an investigation the authority concerned may come to the conclusion that there in no case either to send the case to court or to hold a departmental inquiry But that in our opinion is what would happen in any case of complaint against a public servant in any department of Government No authority entitled to take action against a public servant would straightaway proceed to put the case in court or to hold a departmental inquiry It seems to us axiomatic if a complaint is received against any public servant of any department that the authority concerned would first always make some kind of a preliminary inquiry to satisfy itself whether there is any case for taking action at all but that is in our opinion for the satisfaction of the authority and has nothing to do with the protection afforded to a public servant under Art will be given to the public servant after the the authority has satisfied itself by preliminary inquiry that there is a case for taking action on the power of the Governor to dismiss at pleasure may come into play it appears that the Governor has exercised his pleasure in this case inasmuch as he dismissed the revisional application made to him by the respondent There appears no reason to hold that the Governor exercises his pleasure only when he passes the original order of dismissal but not otherwise If so failure to observe it strictly or otherwise will not invalidate the subsequent departmental proceedings This brings us to the last point which has been urged in this case and that is whether there was substantial compliance with We have already pointed out that there was no strict compliance with as no case wag registered on the complaint of <NAME> and no investigation was made under Chapter XIV of the Code of Criminal Procedure But there is no doubt in this case that before the Superintendent of Police gave the charge sheet to the respondent in November which was the beginning of the departmental proceedings against the respondent he made a preliminary inquiry into the complaint of <NAME> and was satisfied that there was a case for proceeding against the respondent departmentally In these circumstances it appears to us that the spirit of was substantially complied with and action was only taken against the respondent when on a preliminary inquiry the Superintendent of Police was satisfied that departmental action was necessary In these circumstances we are of opinion that which in our opinion is directory was substantially complied with in spirit and therefore the subsequent departmental proceedings cannot be held to be illegal simply because there was no strict compliance with <ORG> therefore in our opinion was wrong in holding that the subsequent departmental inquiry was illegal and its order quashing the order of dismissal on this ground alone cannot be sustained We would therefore allow the appeal BY COURT In accordance with the opinion of the majority this appeal is dismissed with costs
