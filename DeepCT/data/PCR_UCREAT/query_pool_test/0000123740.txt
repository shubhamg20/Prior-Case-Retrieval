The plaintiffs were therefore driven to the necessity of instituting suit No of against them in the court of the Munsif of Muzaffarnagar in which the prayer originally was that the defendants should be restrained by an injunction from making any alterations in the property and from damaging the same so long as the property had continued in their possession as tenants that he may be granted permission under the Control of Rent and Eviction Act No III of to file a suit for ejectment of the tenants or occupants namely <NAME> etc Thereupon the plaintiffs instituted Suit No of in the court of Civil Judge of Muzaffarnagar on the nd of December for the ejectment of the defendants and for recovery of arrears of rent and mesne profits after giving the defendants a notice dated the th of July by which they intended to terminate their tenancy from the Ist of August The defendants resisted the suit on the ground that in view of the provisions of the Rent Control and Eviction Act the permission obtained from the District Magistrate was of no help to the plaintiffs and that they had no cause of action against them They further contended that no forfeiture had been incurred by them and they pleaded Order II Rule as a bar to the suit In ranting the plaintiffs a decree for ejectment and drecting the defendants to vacate the premises within two months the trial court observed In view of my findings above that the permission obtained from the District Magistrate to bring the suit is valid and that the notices of ejectment served to the defendants are also valid the defendants are liable to be ejected from the cinema house But the lower appellate court further held that since the plaintiffs aid not seek ejectment of the defendants in Suit No of aforesaid the present suit in regard to ejectment was barred by Order II Rule of the Code of Civil Procedure The lower appellate court concurred in the view of the trial court that the notice of ejectment given under Section was a perfectly valid notice Against the decision of the Additional District Judge this second appeal has been preferred by the plaintiffs and two points have been urged namely That the suit for ejectment was not barred by Order II Rule of the Code of Civil Procedure and That the permission granted by the District Magistrate under Section ot Act III of was a valid and good permission The defendants continued in occupation of the property as tenants and their possession as tenants had been recognised by the plaintiffs in Suit No of referred to above by which the plaintiffs sought a relief for injunction restraining the defendants from making any alteration in the property and from damaging the same as long as the property continued in their possession as tenants The permission of the District Magistrate for a suit for ejectment postulated under Section of the Rent Control and Eviction Act relates to cases which are not covered by Clauses a to of that section Clause covers a case where the tenant has wilfully caused or per mitted to be caused substantial damage to the accommodation Clause covers a case where the tenant has without the permission in writing of the landlord made or permitted to be made any such construction as in the opinion of the court has materially altered the accommodation or is likely substantially to diminish its value In the present case there is concurrent finding of fact of the two courts below that the tenants wilfully caused or permitted to be caused substantial damage to the accommodation and they without the permission in writing of the landlord made constructions which materially altered the accommodation The present case was therefore covered by Clauses and of Section and the permission of the District Magistrate would not therefore be necessary had been occupying the cinema hall as tenants that they had made substantial alterations in the building which caused damage to the building to a great extent that he did not wish them to continue in occupation of the building the more so because after the abolition of the zamindari which was his main source of income his resources would be considerably affected and he wanted the accommodation for himself in order to start some business <NAME> requested the District Magistrate to grant him the permission to file a civil suit against the occupiers for their eviction The District Magistrate granted the permission which was conveyed by the Rent Control and Eviction Officer of Muzaffarnagar to <NAME> Permission will be awarded to the owner to file a civil suit for the ejectment of the tenant Hence under the orders of the District Magistrate you are hereby accorded permission to file a civil suit against your tenant Sri Debi Prasad under Section of the Rent Control and Eviction Act In regard to the permission aforesaid it has been contended on behalf of the appellants that the lower appellate court view that this permission was defective because it was in favour of only one of the landlords namely <NAME> and against only one of the tenants namely <NAME> was not based upon a correct appreciation of matter It was further held that where it is mainfest that all the plaintiffs landlords who were interested in the matter brought the suit after serving a notice on the tenants to vacate the premises in suit it will be deemed that the plaintiff who obtained the permission acted as agent on behalf of the other plaintiffs We have quoted the order of the District Magistrate and in that order the District Magistrate granted permission to the owner to file a civil suit for the ejectment of the tenant by forfeiture that is to say in case the lessee breaks an express condition which provides that on breach thereof the lessor may re enter and the lessor gives notice in writing to the lease of his intention to determine the lease on the expiration of a notice to determine the lease duly given by one party to the other Under Clause of Section a breach of condition only makes the lease voidable the forfeiture is not complete unless and until the lessor gives notice that he has exercised his option to determine the lease In <NAME> <NAME> All it has been explained that when a forfeiture of a lease is incurred the lease is voidable and not void and in those circumstances the giving of a notice to quit may recognise the subsistence of the lease and may amount to a waiver of forfeiture but when the tenancy is determined by a notice to quit the position is entirely different Under Section of the Transfer of Property Act a forfeiture under Section Clause is waived by acceptance of rent which has become due since the forfeiture or by any other act on the part of the lessor showing an intention to treat the lease as subsisting provided that the lessor is aware that the forfeiture has been incurred provided also that where rent is accepted after the institution of a suit to eject the lessee on the ground of forfeiture such acceptance is not waiver Instances of such acts showing an intention to treat the lease as subsisting are a demand of rent accruing due since the breach a suit for such rent or acceptance of a sum paid into court as damages for breach of covenant to repair alleged to have been committed during the term Keeping in view the principles stated above we now proceed to examine the facts of this case There was no express condition in the terms of the compromise decree dated in Suit No of of the court of Munsif Muzaffarnagar referred to above which provided that on breach thereof the lessor may re enter Even if an express condition like that is to be inferred from the compromise decree emanating from the implied covenants mentioned in Clauses and of Section of the Transfer of Property Act a breach of the condition only makes the lease voidable and the forfeiture woiild not be complete unless and until the lessor gave notice that he had exercised his option to determine the lease under Section Clause of the Act The forfeiture under Section Clause in the present case must be deemed to have been waived not only by acceptance of rent which became due since the forfeiture but by the act on the part of the lessor in the subsequent suit No of brought against the tenants showing an intention to treat the lease as subsisting It appears that in Suit No of aforesaid a compromise was entered into between the parties On when Suit No of was taken up for hearing an application which is paper No on the record was made on behalf of the defendants In that application it was stated that the plaintiffs in their Suit No of of the court of the <ORG> had unequivocally compromised the ground of claim namely that the defendants tenants had materially altered and damaged the premises of the plaintiff and had accepted Rs from the defendants by way of compensation for the said alterations and that in the light of the above fact the plea of damages or alteration of the premises did no longer remain open to the plaintiff in the present suit This application was disposed of by the learned Additional Civil Judge by an order dated by which he stated that Suit No of was compromised between the parties on the understanding that that case as also the present Suit No of shall be compromised together that as a matter of fact the compromise of both these suits had been settled in open Court by the parties and thereafter the first suit was compromised on a payment of certain sum while the terms of the compromise in the second suit were left to be recorded in writing and the completed compromise was to be filed the next day that on the next day the parties informed the court that the corn promise talks had fallen through on account of some misunderstanding and that it would therefore be wrong to contend that the compromise of the first suit should in any way lead to the shutting out of any evidence in this case Upon that view of the matter the learned Additional Civil Judge rejected Application No The learned Additional Civil Judge allowed evidence to be led on the question of material alteration or damage to the building and he held independently of the compromise decree in the earlier Suit No of that there was material damage or alteration to the building as damages for the alterations in the building amounted in our opinion to an act on the part of the lessor showing an intention to treat the lease as subsisting In these circumstances and in view of Section of the Transfer of Property Act the notice given under Section Clause must be deemed to have been waived with the express or implied consent of the persons to whom it was given by an act of the persons giving it showing an intention to treat the lease as subsisting Upon this view of the matter although we have disagreed with some of the findings of the lower appellate court the refusal to grant the relief for ejectment must be upheld There remains only one other point to be determined and that is whether the present suit was barred by Order II Rule of the Code of Civil Procedure As a result of the finding reached by us namely that the notice given under Section Clause must be deemed to have been waived and there was no determination of the lease and further that an intention on the part of the lessor to treat the lease as subsisting was manifest by their own action or conduct this second appeal in our opinion has got no force and we accordingly dismiss it with costs
