This appeal is brought by leave of <ORG> from a judgment of that Court <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> The orders and judgments of <ORG> were made upon applications under Section of the Criminal Procedure Code for directions in the nature of habeas corpus on behalf of nine persons detained in various jails in pursuance of orders made under Rule of the Defence of India Rules on various dates from October to March These orders and judgments directed the release of the applicants Having regard to the known and well settled principle of the English law that a discharge or an order directing discharge under a writ of habeas corpus is final and not subject to appeal and the importance of preserving safeguards of the liberty of the subject their Lordships asked for arguments of counsel on the competency in the present case of the appeals by the <ORG> from <ORG> to <ORG> which might equally affect the competency of this further appeal to this <ORG> An appeal shall lie to <ORG> from any judgment decree or final order of a High Court in British India if <ORG> certifies that the case involves a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of this Act or any Order in Council made thereunder and it shall be the duty of every <ORG> in British India to consider in every case whether or not any such question is involved and of its own motion to give or to withhold a certificate accordingly Where such a certificate is given any party in the case may appeal to <ORG> on the ground that any such question as aforesaid has been wrongly decided and on any ground on which that party could have appealed without special leave to His Majesty in Council if no such certificate has been given and with the leave of <ORG> on any other ground and no direct appeal shall lie to His Majesty in Council either with or without special leave After the decision of <ORG> leave was given by them under Section to appeal to His Majesty in Council Their Lordships have come to the conclusion that in view of the special terms of Section the appeals in the present case were competent My Lords I have insisted at some length upon the peculiarities of the procedure because I think one cannot suppose that the <ORG> intended to alter all the procedure by mere general words without any specific provision as to the practice under the writ of habeas corpus or the statutes which from time to time have regulated both its issue and its consequences literally construed are sufficient to comprehend the case of an order of discharge made upon an application for discharge upon a writ of habeas corpus but it is impossible to contend that the mere fact of a general word being used in a statute precludes all enquiry into the object of the statute or the mischief which it was intended to remedy Mr Justice <NAME> held that <ORG> could issue the Habeas Carpus outside the orginal jurisdiction to the Superintendent of the jail at Ali pore In the Code of Criminal Procedure Act of was enacted which gave the right to European British subjects detained in custody whether within the limits of <ORG> original jurisdiction or outside those limits to apply for an order directing the person detaining him to bring him before <ORG> in other words for an order under Section in the nature of Habeas Corpus Section provided that Neither <ORG>s nor any Judge of such <ORG> shall issue any writ of habeas corpus mainprise de homine replegiando nor any other writ of the like nature beyond the Presidency towns This prohibition cannot in my opinion be confined to the case of European British subjects nor has this been contended before us In <ORG>s Criminal Procedure Act of in Section set out various purposes for which an order in the nature A Habeas Corpus might be made and it gave power to <ORG>s to make such orders in the case of persons within the limits of their original jurisdiction Certain particular matters were excepted it being stated that nothing in this section applies to a person detained under Bengal Regulation III of and certain other Regulations But it is quite clear that for the purposes provided for by Section the intention was that relief should be granted under the section arid recourse should not be had to the old prerogative writs The subsequent history of the matter is shortly this that when the Code of Criminal Procedure was amended in the Acts of and were comprised in Schedule I as enactments repealed by Section but not so as to restore any jurisdiction or form of procedure not existing or followed on the st January Act of The matter remained very much in the same position until when a right was given to everybody within the appellate jurisdiction of this Court to make an application under Section of the present Criminal Procedure Code The question which arises is whether for any of the purposes mentioned in what is now Section it is open to an applicant still to say that he will make his application independently of that section altogether for the prerogative writ of Habeas Corpus on the civil side of <ORG> I observe that it has been stated in certain cases that if there is to be any question of the abolition of this right then the <ORG> must say so in the most specific terms <ORG> has used the most specific terms and it is plain that the Indian <ORG> never intended that the <ORG> in giving relief of this character should for any of the purposes mentioned in Section be at liberty to act under it or under the old procedure this judgment was approved by the Board and it was held that in cases covered by a the power to issue a common law writ of habeas corpus in British India had been taken away by legislation and the powers conferred by Section substituted therefor Under Section of the Criminal Procedure Code no appeal lies from any judgment or order of a criminal Court except as provided for by the Code or by any other law for the time being in force There is no provision in the Code for an appeal from an order made under Section there is no conviction or acquittal in such proceedings and Section which taken along with the new Section A enacted by Section of the Amending Act of Act XXVI of allows an appeal on behalf of the <ORG> only from an order of acquittal is equally inapplicable Turning again to Section of the Government of India Act of their Lordships are clearly of opinion that the section relates to both the civil and criminal jurisdiction of <ORG> the terms of Sub section of Section appear to put this beyond doubt and their Lordships agree with the decision of <ORG> to this effect in <NAME> The Crown The purpose of the provision is to confer a right of appeal in every case that involves a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Act or any Order in Council made thereunder Their Lordships are therefore of opinion that the appeals from <ORG> were competent and it follows that the appeal to His Majesty in Council was also competent and they will proceed to deal with the appeal on the merits The present applications under Section of the Criminal Procedure Code were filed on April two days after the decision of <ORG> in <NAME> King Emperor Bom under which it was held reversing the decision of <ORG> refusing to make an order under Section for release of the applicants that Rule of the Defence of India Rules was ultra vires and was not warranted by the Defence of India Act By Section of the Ordinance a new clause was substituted for Clause of Section of the Defence of India Act Section of the Ordinance provided that no order heretofore made against any person under Rule of the Defence of India Rules shall be deemed to be invalid or shall be called in question on the ground merely that the said rule purported to confer powers in excess of the powers that might at the time the said rule was made be lawfully conferred by a rule made or deemed to have been made under Section of the Defence of India Act The amendment effected by Section of the Ordinance removed the grounds on which <ORG> had pronounced Rule to be ultra vires Act XXXV of as amended by Section of the Defence of India Amendment Act Act XIX of are as follows i The Central Government may by notification in the official <ORG> make such rules as appear to it to be necessary or expedient for securing the defence of British India the public safety the maintenance of public order or the efficient prosecution of war or for maintaining supplies and services essential to the life of the community Without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred by subjection i the rules may provide for or may empower any authority to make orders providing for all or any of the following matters namely preventing the spreading without lawful authority or excuse of false reports or the prosecution of any purpose likely to cause disaffection or alarm or to prejudice His Majesty relations with foreign powers or with States in India or to prejudice the maintenance of peaceful conditions in the tribal areas or to promote feelings of enmity and hatred between different classes of His Majesty subjects the apprehension and detention in custody of any person reasonably suspected of being of hostile origin or of having acted acting or being about to act in a manner prejudicial to the public safety or interest or to the defence of British India the prohibition of such person from entering or residing or remaining in any area and the compelling of such person to reside and remain in any area or to do or abstain from doing anything The Central Government or <ORG> if it is satisfied with respect to any particular person that with a view to prevent him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the defence of British India the public safety the maintenance of a public order His Majesty relations with foreign powers or Indian States the maintenance of peaceful conditions in tribal areas or the efficient prosecution of the war it is necessary so to do may make an order a directing that he be detained We therefore reject the main argument addressed to us on behalf of the appellant and if there were nothing more in the appeal we should dismiss it without further discussion There is however another aspect of the case which was not argued until the <ORG> itself drew the attention of counsel to it for it seemed to us that it was open to question whether rule itself in its present form was within the rule making powers conferred by the Defence of India Act The learned Judge then proceeded to discuss paragraphs and of Section of the Act and for reasons fully stated by him he came to the conclusion that Rule was not within the powers conferred by Sub section of Section and he stated The <ORG> having set out in plain and unambiguous language in paragraph the scope of the rules which may be made providing for apprehension and detention in custody it is not permissible to pray in aid the more general words in Section in order to justify a rule which so plainly goes beyond the limits of paragraph though if paragraph were not in the Act at all perhaps different considerations might apply We are compelled therefore to hold that rule in its present form goes beyond the rule making powers which the <ORG> has thought fit to confer upon <ORG> and is for that reason invalid In the opinion of their Lordships the function of Sub section is merely an illustrative one the rule making power is conferred by Sub section and the rules which are referred to in the opening sentence of Sub section are the rules which are authorised by and made under Sub section the provisions of Sub section are not restrictive of Sub section as indeed is expressly stated by the words without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred by Sub section Their Lordships are therefore of opinion that <NAME> case was wrongly decided by <ORG> and that Rule was made in conformity with the powers conferred by Sub section of Section of the Defence of India Act It is accordingly unnecessary for their Lordships to consider whether Rule was not also within paragraphs and of Sub section of Section contrary to the opinion of <ORG> and their Lordships express no opinion on the matter As regards the remaining questions counsel for the <ORG> stated them under two main heads viz first whether the orders of detention can be questioned in view of the provisions of Section of the Government of India Act and Section of the Defence of India Act and secondly assuming that they can be so questioned whether there were materials on which the <ORG> below could properly decide that the orders were not made in conformity with Rule Whereas the person known as <NAME> A son of late <NAME> of Kali Banerjee Lane Howrah is detained in the Howrah Jail under the provision in rule of the Defence of India Rules And whereas the Governor is satisfied that with a view to preventing the said person from acting in any manner prejudicial to the Defence of British India the public safety the maintenance of public order or the efficient prosecution of the war it is necessary to make the following orders to continue his detention Now therefore in exercise of the powers conferred by Clause of Sub rule and sub rule of rule of the Defence of India Rules the Governor is pleased to direct a that the said person shall until further orders be detained that until further orders the said person shall continue to be detained in the Howrah Jail and that during such detention the said person shall be subject to the conditions laid down in the Bengal Security Prisoners Rules of Bengal there is no material difference from the above order in the case of the remaining orders a Provincial Government as respects anything done or to be done by the Provincial Government after the commencement of Part III of the Government of India Act shall mean a in a Governor Province the Governor acting or not acting in his discretion and exercising or not exercising his individual judgment according to the provision in that behalf made by and under the said Act Section of the Government of India Act on which the <ORG> relies provides Orders and other instruments made and executed in the name of the Governor shall be authenticated in such manner as may be specified in rules to be made by the Governor and the validity of an order or instrument which is so authenticated shall not be called in question on the ground that it is not an order or instrument made or executed by the Governor In the opinion of their Lordships the contention of the <ORG> goes too far as the sub section only relates to one specified ground of challenge namely that the order or instrument was not made or executed by the Governor question the accuracy of a recital contained in a duly authenticated order particularly where that recital purports to state as a fact the carrying out of what I regard as a condition necessary to the valid making of that order The presence of the recital in the order will place a difficult burden on the detenue to produce admissible evidence sufficient to establish even a prima facie case that the recital is not accurate No order made in exercise of any power conferred by or under this Act shall be called in question in any Court Where an order purports to have been made and signed by any authority in exercise of any power conferred by or under this Act a Court shall within the meaning of the Indian Evidence Act presume that such order was so made by that authority Sub section assumes that the order is made in exercise of the power which clearly leaves it open to challenge on the ground that it was not made in conformity with the power conferred heavily though the burden of proof may lie on the challenger as stated by the Chief Justice in the passage just cited Sub section raises a presumption of fact which may be displaced though here again the burden is likely to be heavy Section of the Indian Evidence Act provides Whenever it is directed by this Act that the Court shall presume a fact it shall regard such fact as proved unless and until it is disproved Accordingly the contention of the <ORG> that the <ORG> has no jurisdiction to investigate the validity of the orders fails They based their conclusion mainly on the power of delegation which has admittedly not been exercised in the present case conferred by Sub section of Section of the Defence of India Act which provides as follows A Provincial Government may by order direct that any power or duty which by rule made under Sub section i is conferred or imposed on the Provincial Government or which being by such rule conferred or imposed on <ORG> has been directed under Sub section to be exercised or discharged by the Provincial Government shall in such circumstances and under such conditions if any as may be specified in the direction be exercised or discharged by any officer or authority not being except in the case of a Chief Commissioner Province an officer or authority subordinate to <ORG> I The executive authority of a Province shall be exercised on behalf of His Majesty by the Governor either directly or through officers subordinate to him but nothing in this section shall prevent the <ORG> or <ORG> from conferring functions upon subordinate authorities or be deemed to transfer to the Governor any functions conferred by any existing Indian law or any court judge or officer or any local or other authority Subject to the provisions of this Act the executive authority of each Province extends to the matters with respect to which <ORG> has power to make laws There shall be a council of ministers to aid and advise the Governor in the exercise of his functions except in so far as he is by or under this Act required to exercise his functions or any of them in hi discretion Provided that nothing in this sub section shall be construed as preventing the Governor from exercising his individual judgment in any case where by or under this Act he is required so to do If any question arises whether any matter is or is not a matter as respects which the Governor is by or under this Act required to act in his discretion or to exercise his individual judgment the decision of the Governor in his discretion shall be final and the Validity of anything done by the Governor shall not be called in question on the ground that he ought or ought not to have acted in his discretion or ought or ought not to have exercised his individual judgment the Governor shall make rules for the more convenient transaction of the business of <ORG> and for the allocation among ministers of the said business in so far as it is not business with respect to which the Governor is by or under this Act required to act in his discretion The rules shall include provisions requiring ministers and secretaries to Government to transmit to the Governor all such information with respect to the business of <ORG> as may be specified in the rules or as the Governor may otherwise require to be so transmitted and in particular requiring a minister to bring to the notice of the Governor and the appropriate secretary to bring to the notice of the minister concerned and of the Governor any matter under consideration by him which involves or appears to him likely to involve any special responsibility of the Governor Rules of business have been framed by the Governor of Bengal under Section under which it is not disputed that questions of detention fall to be transacted in <ORG> Under Rule all orders or instruments made or executed by or on behalf of <ORG> are to be expressed to be made by or by order of the Governor of Bengal and under Rule save in cases of special authorisation every order or instrument of <ORG> is to be signed by either a Secretary an Additional Secretary a Joint Secretary a Deputy Secretary an Under Secretary or an Assistant Secretary to <ORG> and such signatures are to be deemed to be the proper authentication of such orders or instruments In the first place their Lordships observe that the provisions of Chapter II of Part III of the Act of as to <ORG> and its executive authority use the term executive in the broader sense as including both a decision as to action and the carrying out of such decision Counsel for the respondents submitted a contention which the majority of the learned Judges in <ORG> had accepted based on Sub section of Section of the Act of to the effect that the sub section limited the operation of the section to matters with respect to which <ORG> has power to make laws and that the subject matter of <ORG> was not within those powers The learned Judges in confirmation of this view referred to Sub section of Section which provides that An Act of the Federal Legislature may notwithstanding that it relates to a matter with respect to which <ORG> has no power to make laws confer powers and impose duties or authorise the conferring of powers and the imposition of duties upon a Province or officers and authorities thereof Their Lordships are unable to agree with such a narrow reading of these provisions which would involve the necessity of <ORG> making provision in each case for the executive machinery to carry out the powers and duties so imposed instead of using the existing Provincial machinery This view is supported by Sub section of Section which provides inter alia that where an Act of <ORG> by virtue of Sub section confers powers and imposes duties upon a Province or officers and authorities thereof in relation to a matter with respect to which <ORG> has no power to make laws the <ORG> is to pay to the Province such sum as is agreed or determined by arbitration in respect of any extra costs of administration incurred by the Province in connection with exercise of those powers and duties Their Lordships would also add on this contention that Sub section of Section provides a means of delegation in the strict sense of the word namely a transfer of the power or duty to the officer or authority defined in the sub section with a corresponding divestiture of the Governor of any responsibility in the matter whereas under Section of the Act of the Governor remains responsible for the action of his subordinates taken in his name Their Lordships are therefore in agreement with the learned Chief Justice of <ORG> that such matters as those which fell to be dealt with by the Governor under Rule could be dealt with by him in the normal manner in which the executive business of <ORG> was carried on under the provisions of Chapter II of Part III of the Act of and in particular under the provisions of Section and the rules of business made under Section In view of the opinions already expressed by their Lordships the orders for detention in each of these cases must be taken as ex facie regular and proper and it follows as already stated that there is a heavy burden on the respondents to displace the presumption enacted by Section of the Defence of India Act The respondents were enabled to raise the question as to whether the Governor was bound to give his personal consideration to the matter by reason of the <ORG> admission that he had not in fact done so in any of these cases The majority of <ORG> held all the detention orders to be bad because of the first of these admissions though they also deal with the routine order and criticise adversely the whole procedure The evidence before <ORG> consisted of affidavits by the respondents the counter affidavit by Mr <NAME> Additional Home Secretary to <ORG> and certain statements and answers regarding detention under Rule given by the Home Minister Bengal in <ORG> Further there is nothing in the affidavits filed by the respondents which establishes such a prima facie case and they were not so founded on at the hearing before the <ORG> The respondents case was founded on the statements and answers by the Home Minister as to which their Lordships have expressed their view above and Mr <NAME> counter affidavit which their Lordships will now consider Defence of India Rules together with a recommendation by the <ORG> for detention under Rule in respect of persons arrested in connection with the disturbances or suspected of being so connected orders of detention under Rule I should at once be issued as a matter of course subject to review by <ORG> on receipt of further details to be supplied in each case by <ORG> On th October I considered the materials before me and in accordance with the general order of Government directed the issue of an order of detention under Rule of the Defence of India Rules Police to see if there was material sufficient to justify the issue of an order under the routine order That would not be in accordance with the requirement of the routine order that the police having recommended it the order of detention should be issued as a matter of course Their Lordships agree with the unanimous conclusion of <ORG> that the orders of detention in the cases of the present respondents Nos and are invalid There remain the cases of respondents Nos and The orders of detention in these cases were earlier in date than the routine order of October and are not affected thereby As their Lordships have already stated there is no evidence in these cases sufficient to rebut the presumption as to their regularity There is only one point on which their Lordships desire to add an observation In paragraphs and of his affidavit Mr <NAME> states that in the cases of <NAME> present respondent No <NAME> present respondent No and <NAME> present respondent No he himself considered the materials supplied and in fact the orders of detention were signed by him Accordingly their Lordships agree with the Chief Justice of <ORG> that the orders of detention in the cases of respondents Nos and were valid and the appeal of the <ORG> will be allowed in the case of these four respondents Counsel for the <ORG> stated to their Lordships that without prejudice to any further action under Rule that the <ORG> may find it expedient or necessary to take it was not intended that any further action should be taken against these four respondents under the particular orders which are before the <ORG> in this appeal Their Lordships will therefore humbly advise His Majesty that the appeal should be allowed as respects respondents Nos and and the judgments and orders of the <ORG> below should be set aside and that it should be declared that the order of detention under Rule of the Defence of India Rules in each of these cases was a valid and proper order that in the case of respondents Nos and the appeal should be dismissed and the judgments and orders of the <ORG> below should be affirmed
