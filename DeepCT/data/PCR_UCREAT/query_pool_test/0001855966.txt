DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH <NAME> VIVIAN BENCH <NAME> VIVIAN MUKHERJEA HASAN <NAME> VENKATARAMA CITATION AIR SCR CITATOR INFO SC SC ACT Transfer of Property Act Act IV of Section as amended by Act XX of Document Wether a mortgage or sale outright Principles for determining whether the document is one or the other HEADNOTE There is no hard and fast rule for determining whether a given transaction is a mortgage by conditional sale or sale outright with a condition for repurchase Each case must be decided on its own facts If the words are express and clear effect must be given to them and any extraneous enquiry into what was thought or in If however there is ambiguity in the language employed then it is permissible to look to the surrounding circumstances to determine what was intended In view of the provisions of the amended section of the Transfer of Property Act if the sale and agreement to repurchase are embodied in separate documents then the transaction cannot be a mortgage whether the documents are contemporaneously executed or not But the mere fact that there is only one document does not necessarily mean that it must be a mortgage and cannot be a sale On th May <NAME> alone executed a simple mortgage in favour of the second defendant for Rs The same three persons executed the disputed deed He obtained a decree against the mortgagors alone and executed it in He himself purchased the property in dispute and took possession on th March Shortly after on th August he sold this land to the plaintiff for Rs The first defendant case is that the transaction of th April was not a mortgage but an out and out sale with a covenant for repurchase which became infructuous because no attempt was made to act on the covenant within the time specified The question whether a given transaction is a mortgage by conditional sale or a sale outright with a condition of repurchase is a vexed one which invariably gives rise to trouble and litigation There are numerous decisions on the point and much industry has been expended in some of <ORG> in collating and analysing them But there is nothing special about that in this class of cases and here as in every other case where a document has to be construed the intention must be gathered in the first place from the document itself effect must be given to them and any extraneous enquiry into what was thought or intended is ruled out If however there is ambiguity in the language employed then it is permissible to look to the surrounding circumstances to determine what was intended As Lord <NAME> said in A Aderson White The rule of law on this subject is one dictated by commonsense that prima facie an absolute conveyance containing nothing to show that the relation of debtor and creditor is to exist between the parties does not cease to be an absolute conveyance and become a mortgage merely because the vendor stipulates that he shall have a right to repurchase In every such case the question is what upon a fair construction is the meaning of the instruments The converse also holds good and if on the face of it an instrument clearly purports to be a mortgage it cannot be turned into a sale by reference to a host of I A Difficulty only arises in the border line cases where there is ambiguity If the sale and agreement to repurchase are embodied in separate documents then the transaction cannot be a mortgage whether the documents are contemporaneously executed or not But the converse does not hold good that is to say the mere fact that there is only one document does not necessarily mean that it must be a mortgage and cannot be a sale I and at present there is no other way in view rather it seems impossible and difficult to arrange for the money without selling the property let out in rehan simple mortgage under the above mentioned bond and we put the said vendee in possession and occupation of the vended property detailed below and made him an absolute proprietor in our places If we the executants shall repay the consideration money to the said vendee within two years the property vended under this deed of conditional sale attached shall come in exclusive possession and occupation of us the executants and we declare also that the vended property is flawless in every way and that if in future any kind of defect whatsoever be found on account of which the said vendee be dispossessed of a portion or the entire property vended under this deed of conditional sale and will have to pay the loss or damage in that event we the executants a shall be liable to be prosecuted under the criminal procedure and we shall pay the entire consideration money together with loss and damage and interest at the rate of Rs It has however no clause for retransfer and instead says clause that if the executants pay the money within two yeas the property shall come in exclusive possession and occupation of us the executants In the context we can only take these words to mean that if there is payment within the specified time then the title will continue to reside in the executants for what else can a right of exclusive possession import in these circumstances It is relevant to note in passing that this silence about title would be proper in a mortgage for there the owner title remains in him all the while and so a reconveyance is unnecessary But if there is an out and out sale the title could not revert to the original owner without a proper reconveyance It is true the words of conveyance in the earlier part Of the deed clause would pass an absolute title if they stood alone but the document must be read as a whole and it must also be remembered that it was executed by ignorant justice and scribed by a man whose knowledge of conveyancing was on the face of it rudimentary and defective for its ambiguities that there is ambiguity is patent from what we have said The first point there is to see whether there is an ostensible sale That means a transaction which takes the outward form of a sale for the essence of a mortgage by conditional sale is that though in substance it is a mortgage it is couched in the form of a sale with certain conditions attached The ones relevant to the present purpose are contained in clauses and Those are not the actual words used but in our opinion that is a fair construction of their meaning when the document is read as a whole If that is what they mean as we hold they do then the matter falls squarely within the ambit of section Now as we have already said once a transaction is embodied in One document and not two and once its terms are covered by section then it must be taken to be a mortgage by conditional sale unless there are express words to indicate the contrary or in a case of ambiguity the attendant circumstances necessarily lead to the opposite conclusion There are no express words here which say that this is not a mortgage but there is ambiguity so we must probe further The respondents who claim that this is a sale and not a mortgage rely on the following circumstances Next they point to clause where the executants say that they have no other Means of raising the money they want except by selling the property The word mortgage is also used in clause therefore it is clear that when a mortgage is intended the word mortgage is used The only weakness in this argument is that when a mortgage is by conditional sale this is the form it has to take because section postulates that there must be an ostensible sale and if a sale is ostensible it must necessarily contain all the outward indicate of a real sale The question we are considering can only arise when the word sale is used and of course a sale imports a transfer of title The learned counsel for the respondents next relied on the fact that clause says that the price paid was a fair and just one and that the Courts below have found that the consideration was not inadequate But on the other side there is the very significant fact that Rs The learned <ORG> Judges discount this by saying that there is no evidence to show that the proceedings which were started in continued after the deed Mr <NAME> produced a certified copy of the revenue record here and that gives the missing date Persons who are selling their property would hardly take the trouble to borrow money in order to continue revenue proceedings which could no longer benefit them and could only enure for the good of their transferees There is another point in favour of the appellant and that is that the surrounding circumstances show that there was a relationship of debtor and creditor between the The point made on behalf of the respondents about the adequacy of the consideration and the absence of interest can be explained We say this because the indemnity clause clause says in sub clause that in the event of the transferee possession being disturbed the executants would among other things pay him in addition to damages the entire consideration together with interest at per cent It is true this can also be read the other way but considering these very drastic provisions as also the threat of a criminal prosecution in sub clause a we think the transferee was out to exact more than his pound of flesh from the unfortunate rustics with whom he was dealing and that he would not have agreed to account for the profits indeed that is his own case for he says that this was a sale out and out In these circumstances there would be no need to keep a reasonable margin between the debt and the value of the property as is ordinarily done in the case of a mortgage The decree of <ORG> is set aside and that of the lower appellate <ORG> is restored except as to costs He is no longer in the picture as he sold it to the plaintiff for Rs In the circumstances we direct that each party bear its own costs
