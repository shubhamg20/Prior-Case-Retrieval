The relevant facts appearing from the statement of the case in IT Ref No of are that the assessee had entered into an agreement with <NAME> Basle st Jan The assessee entered in another supplementary agreement on th July for manufacturing cyanuric chloride Under this agreement the assessee had to pay certain amounts in five equal instalments to <NAME> for acquiring technical know how The first payment in respect of which was made in financial year The assessee claimed deduction thereof as business expenditure of manufacturing cyanuric chloride commencing from financial year as a revenue expenditure The <ORG> rejected the contention of the assessee by taking the view that because the payments were made for getting sub licence to manufacture cyanuric chloride for a period not less than years it could not be claimed as a revenue expenditure The CIT A held that the payment in question represented normal revenue expenditure which should have been allowed as a deduction by the <ORG> However the amount claimed in each case is different We have heard the learned counsel for the parties Likewise <ORG> has also obtained licence from a German company <ORG> to manufacture in India cyanuric chloride under or according to <ORG> patents processes know how and improvements The plant for manufacturing cyanuric chloride would not be discontinued even after the expiry of the period but continue to manufacture the same under the process already made known to the assessee inasmuch as there was no stipulation under the agreement either principal or supplementary that on termination of the agreement the assessee would discontinue the manufacture of cyanuric chloride On the other hand it was contended by the learned counsel for the assessee <NAME> that the technical know how acquired under the said agreement was operational cost for the running the business and the amount paid to the collaborator of technical know how was only paid for the use of the process developed by <ORG> or <ORG> for manufacturing cyanuric chloride in India and acquisition of right to use is distinct from acquisition to the right itself Mere right to use technical know how without having proprietary right therein cannot be considered capital in the hands of the assessee We have given careful consideration to the rival contentions Under of the IT Act all expenditure laid out wholly and exclusively for the purpose of business or profession are to be allowed as deduction while computing the income provided the same are not in the nature of capital expenditure or personal expenses of the assessee apart from the condition that the same may not be governed by any other express provision of the Act In the present case the only question that arises for consideration is other condition being satisfied that the expenses are wholly and exclusively for the purpose of business and are not governed by any other express provision whether the expenses claimed are of capital nature In some cases it has been held that expenditure which brings into existence asset or advantage of enduring benefit is to be considered as capital expenditure A disbursement when it is referable to fixed capital or capital asset is treated as capital expenditure but when it relates to circulating capital or stock in trade it is treated as revenue It has to be derived from many aspects of the whole set of circumstances some of which may point in one direction and some in the other One consideration may point so clearly that it dominates other and vague indications in the contrary directions It is a common sense appreciation of all the guiding factors which must provide the ultimate answer Test which was laid by Viscount <NAME> in the case of <ORG> Tax Cases When an expenditure is made not only once and for all but with a view to bringing into existence an asset or an advantage for the enduring benefit of trade I think that there is good reason in the absence of special circumstances leading to an opposite conclusion for treating such expenditure attributable not to revenue but to capital Lord <NAME> in <ORG> vs <NAME> Tax Cases opined that the capital expenditure is a thing which is going to be spent once and for all income expenditure is a thing which is going to be recur every year What is meant by expression once and for all The expression once and for all is used to denote an expenditure which is made once and for all for procuring an enduring benefit to the business as distinct from recurring expenditure in the nature of operational expenses If on the other hand it is made not for the purpose of bringing into existence any such asset or advantage for but for running the business or working it with a view to produce the profit it is a revenue expenditure The aim and object of expenditure would determine the character of expenditure whether it is a capital expenditure or a revenue expenditure Another test evolved was to find out as to whether the expenses incurred are part of the working expenses or the expenditure laid out as part of the process of profit earning In other words it is capital outlay if such expenditure is necessary for the acquisition of property or of rights of a permanent character the possession of which is a condition of carrying on its trade at all Is it part of the company working expenses Is it expenditure laid out as part of the process of profit making Or on the other hand is it a capital outlay is it expenditure necessary for the acquisition of property or of rights of a permanent character the possession of which is a condition of carrying on its trade at all of Taxation CLR is that What is an outgoing of capital and what is an outgoing on account of revenue depends on what the expenditure is calculated to effect from a practical and business point of view rather than upon the juristic classification of the legal rights if any secured employed or exhausted in the process <ORG> said that when dealing with cases of this kind where the question is whether expenditure incurred by an assessee is capital or revenue expenditure the question must be viewed in the larger context of business necessity or expediency If the outgoing expenditure is so related to the carrying on or the conduct of the business that it may be regarded as an integral part of profit earning process and not the acquisition of asset or right of a permanent character the possession of which is a condition of carrying on business the expenditure may be regarded as revenue expenditure If the advantage consists merely in facilitating the assessee trading operations or enabling the management and conduct of the assessee business to be carried on more efficiently or more profitably by leaving the fixed capital untouched the expenditure would be on revenue account even though the advantage may endure for an indefinite future Another test which has been applied while considering the nature of expenses is that if it is made for initiation of business or extension of business or substantial replacement of equipment The pharmaceutical section of <ORG> in India was taken over by the assessee in Under an agreement the <ORG> undertook to deliver to the assessee all processes formulae scientific data working rules and prescriptions pertaining to the manufacture or processing products discovered and developed in the <ORG> laboratories and to forward to the assessee as far as possible all scientific and bibliographic information pamphlets or drafts which might be useful to introduce the licensed preparation and to promote their sale in India it granted to the assessee full and sole rights and licence under patent listed in the agreement to make use of the same and also a licence to use certain specified trade marks in the territory subject to any existing licence to third parties held at the date of the agreement or the <ORG> may grant to third party thereafter In consideration of that right to receive scientific and technical assistance payments were to be made to the <ORG> Repelling the <ORG> contention that the contribution made to the <ORG> was not entitled to deduction under xv because expenses were capital in nature the Court said The assessee did not under the agreement become entitled exclusively even for the period of the agreement to the patents and trade marks of <ORG> it had merely access to the technical knowledge and experience in the pharmaceutical field which <ORG> commanded The assessee was on that account mere licensee for a limited period of the technical knowledge of <ORG> with the right to use the patents and trade marks of that company The assessee acquired under the agreement merely the right to draw for the purpose of carrying on its business as a manufacturer and dealer of pharmaceutical products upon the technical knowledge of <ORG> for a limited period by making that technical knowledge available <ORG> did not part with any asset of its business nor did the assessee acquire any asset or advantage of an enduring nature for the benefit of its business The Court said applying tests that aim and object for incurring expenses is one of the guiding factors and as the expenses in the case was for the acquisition of the know how as it was a condition on which the collaboration agreed to part with the technical knowledge to the assessee it was treated to be the revenue expenditure on commercial principle It was granted licence for manufacture of penicillin With a view to increasing the yield the appellant negotiated with <ORG> a reputed Japanese enterprise whereunder in consideration for once for all payment of US it agreed to supply the assessee pilot plant technical information know how and written description of <ORG> process for fermentation of penicillin with a flow sheet of the process on pilot plant and to arrange for the training of appellant representatives in various plants in Japan at assessee expenditure and advise the assessee in large scale manufacture for a period of years Assessee claim for deduction of the sum paid to the Japanese company as revenue expenditure was disallowed by the <ORG> holding that the expenses were capital in nature For the purpose of setting up of new plant and new process and that the for complete replacement of the business inasmuch as the new process and new establishment of plant was to be put up in place of old process and old plant Reversing the decision of <ORG> Hon ble Supreme Court observed that there was no material before the <ORG> to come to the finding that the appellant had obtained under the agreement a completely new plant with a completely new process and completely new technical know how There was no material before the <ORG> that the area of improvisation was not part of the existing business There was no material to hold that it amounted to a new or fresh venture What was stipulated was improvement of operation of existing business and its efficiency and profitability not removed from the area of day to day business of the appellants established enterprise The financial outlay under the agreement for the better conduct and improvement of the existing business and as revenue in nature and was allowable deduction in computing the business profit of the appellant The most important aspects relevant for the present purpose which can be culled out from above discussion is that where expenses are incurred in areas which supplement the existing business and is not a fresh or new venture and agreement of acquiring technical know how pertain to product already in the line of the established business which was intended to improve the operations of the existing business its efficiency and profitability from the area of day to day business of the appellant established enterprise expenses be treated as revenue and not capital On the other hand if the technical know how is acquired for the purpose of establishing altogether a new or fresh venture launching of a new enterprise the same expenditure may be treated as capital and not revenue Under the principal agreement clause the assessee was though free to purchase raw materials and intermediaries from any source but the purchase of products manufactured by <ORG> or from those who produce and manufacture raw material and intermediaries under the <ORG> patent there was a prohibition to purchase such raw material from any source manufacturing the intermediary products in violation of <ORG> patent Cyanuric chloride was one of the raw materials used in the manufacture of Tinopal which was consumed in large quantities If therefore applying the test laid down in <ORG> case supra which in our opinion does apply to the facts of the present case the assessee existing business was the business of manufacturing Tinopal the product which the assessee intended to manufacture namely cyanuric chloride was one of the raw materials which until it started manufacturing was being purchased in large quantities from the market the purpose of production of cyanuric chloride was found by the <ORG> to be the manufacture of raw material or production of Tinopal that is to say the purpose was in the area of existing business of the assessee for carrying on the existing business with more profitability and was not for the purposes of entering into a new adventure for operating in a new area of business If that be so the expenses incurred for acquiring the technical know how to manufacture raw material necessary for the principal product of the assessee to cut down the cost of producing raw materials from the market was the operational cost of the existing business incurred for the purpose of cutting down the day to day cost of the business and not for the purpose of installing a new business the expenses had to be held to be revenue in nature and not capital though we observe that the <ORG> was not correct in observing that there would be no useful knowledge left which would help the assessee in manufacturing cyanuric chloride after the agreement is concluded As a result of operation of clause which required the assessee to return <ORG> all documents put at the assessee disposal and relating to manufacturing of engineering plants designs etc However as we observe in the present case particularly in the matter of acquisition of the technical know how it is of great importance that for what purpose technical know how was acquired Now it is obvious that by purchase of such quota right the assessee would be able to acquire more raw material and that would increase the profitability of his profit making apparatus but the amount paid for purchase of such quota right would indubitably be revenue expenditure since it is incurred for acquiring raw material and is part of the operating cost The principle fully applies to the facts found by the <ORG> in the present case according to which the assessee had entered into an agreement on th July for manufacturing raw material for the purpose of production of Tinopal Even applying the test of acquisition of assets it can be said that under the agreement the assessee did not acquire the capital asset itself namely the technical know how as a proprietor thereof What it acquired under the agreement on th July was only the right to use technical knowledge available with <ORG> or <ORG> It had right only to use that knowledge for the purpose of manufacturing cyanuric chloride within India But it cannot be said that by such acquisition of knowledge the assessee has acquired any capital asset So far as question as to whether it amounts to acquisition of advantage benefit of enduring nature is concerned as we have already discussed it depends upon the object with which such advantage or benefit has been acquired If the advantage or benefit had been acquired to facilitate running of the existing business it should be treated as the expenditure on revenue account If the advantage or benefit acquired for establishing a fresh venture it may be treated as part of expenditure on capital account As in the present case the finding of the <ORG> reveals that the advantage was acquired for the purpose of manufacturing raw material for production of Tinopal which was the existing business of the assessee we have no hesitation in coming to conclusion that the expenditure incurred was rightfully held to be on revenue account Accordingly we answer the question referred to us in affirmative in all the four cases in favour of the assessee and against the <ORG>
