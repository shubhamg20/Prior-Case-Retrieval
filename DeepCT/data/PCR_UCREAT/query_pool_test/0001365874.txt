The suit was decreed by <ORG> and an appeal from the judgment and decree of <ORG> was dismissed The suit was instituted by <NAME> respondent in this appeal against Smt The latter in turn sold it to the respondent After the purchase of the house which professedly was for the purpose of his own residence the respondent obtained the District Magistrate permission dated to sue the tenant for eviction He had already given a notice dated to the appellant terminating the tenancy and asking for vacation of the premises Since permission had been obtained to file a suit against the widow and not the sons and daughters of <NAME> and the notice terminating the tenancy had also been addressed to and served upon the widow alone it was pleaded that the notice was bad for that reason and the permission was also illegal and without jurisdiction As to the plea of the notice being invalid on the ground that it was not given after the grant of permission by the District Magistrate not again after the confirmation of the District Magistrate order by the Commissioner the learned Additional <NAME> who tried the suit held that it was not necessary to give the notice after the grant of permission and that it could be given before that The plea has not been pressed again at least in this Court and for obvious reasons as it has been held in several decisions of this Court that it is not necessary that the notice under Section of the Transfer of Property Act be given only after the permission to evict has been obtained About the additional ground raised by an amendment of the written statement that the notice was bad because it had been both addressed to and served upon the appellant alone though <NAME> had left other heirs and the tenancy devolved upon those other heirs also the learned <NAME> held that the appellant alone had been acting as and asserting herself to be the tenant and had for all practical purposes been recognised as the tenant and she was thus the sole tenant He was further of the opinion that even if the sons and daughters had inherited the tenancy rights they had impliedly surrendered those rights in favour of their mother For these reasons he held the notice to have been rightly given to the appellant alone On the plea that <ORG> had stayed the operation of the order of the lower authorities granting permission and the suit was therefore not maintainable the learned <NAME> found that no order of stay of <ORG> was on the record and so he rejected the plea In the appeal filed by the defendant Smt <NAME> the second Additional Civil Judge who disposed the same held that it being undisputed that a tenancy is heritable in the absence of a contract to the contrary and that <NAME> had left surviving him not only the appellant but also sons and daughters those sons and daughters also became co tenants of the house with the widow Learned counsel for both the sides have been heard at length It may be noted here that another second civil appeal No of with a similar plea about invalidity of notice given to one co tenant only was also tacked with this appeal under decision after it had been heard in part and this appeal is being decided after hearing also learned counsel for both the sides in that other second appeal On the side of the appellant it has been urged that the decisions of <ORG> in India have no doubt been that a notice served on one of the co tenants is a good notice to the other co tenants but that is only where the notice is addressed to all In regard to the <ORG> decision aforesaid the argument is that the same is distinguishable because it relates to a case of joint tenants as distinct from tenants in common which is the position of the appellant and the other heirs of <NAME> who succeeded to the tenancy by inheritance Now the expression joint tenants has very often been used in those earlier cases too which have been cited on the appellant side and on which reliance is placed for the argument that in order to be effective under Section of the Transfer of Property Act the notice must be addressed to all the co tenants but it has not been urged that in those decisions also the expression joint tenants was intended to refer to co tenants holding as joint tenants as distinguished from tenants in common It has also not been disputed that the expression joint tenants was used in those cases as a substitute for co tenants and not with a view to indicate the nature of the estate held by the co tenants It therefore needs to be examined whether the <ORG> decision referred to above was peculiar to any joint tenancy estate held by the co tenants in the tenancy and whether the same is not applicable to co tenants who got the rights of a tenant in the tenancy on his death by inheritance At the outset it may be stated that there is no controversy on the proposition that even in the case of a monthly tenancy the tenancy is inherited by the heirs of the tenant on his death That is why the expression joint tenants used in dealing with a case of more than one person holding together the tenancy either by original lease in their favour or by inheritance from a deceased tenant is meant to convey nothing more than the idea that such persons hold the tenancy as one entity and not that they hold that kind of estate which is governed by the rule of passing by survivorship If the <ORG> decision in AIR SC can be said to be in relation to a case of joint tenants in such ordinary sense of the expression then it would be directly relevant to the instant case but if it laid down law of sufficiency of notice to determine lease by being given to one of the co tenants to a case where the co tenants were holding the tenancy by way of an estate of joint tenancy then the decision would be distinguishable though the point would still require decision whether in other cases of joint tenancy also notice to one of the joint tenants will not be good and effective in law for the purpose of terminating the tenancy The land had been leased by the Trustees of <ORG> on a monthly tenancy to two persons Those two persons later assigned their rights in the lease to <NAME> and <NAME> and the assignment appeared to have been accepted by the lessors Some years later the Trustees of <ORG> sent a notice to <NAME> and <NAME> requiring them to vacate the premises and deliver vacant and peaceful possession on a certain date On non compliance with the notice the suit was instituted against both the persons It however turned out that <NAME> had died much earlier to the institution of the suit and the plaintiff therefore amended the plaint by deleting the name of <NAME> The suit was decreed by <ORG> by holding that the tenancy was a joint tenancy and notice to one of the joint tenants was sufficient and that the suit was also not bad for non joinder of the legal representatives of <NAME> In paragraph of the judgment of <ORG> it was observed The argument about notice need not detain us long By the deed of assignment dated February the tenants took the premises as joint tenants the assignors do and each of them doth hereby assign and assure that the assignee as joint tenants The deed of assignment was approved and accepted by the Trustees of <ORG> and <NAME> and the appellant must be regarded as joint tenants Once it is held that the tenancy was joint a notice to one of the joint tenants was sufficient and the suit for the same reason was also good Mr <NAME> in arguing the case of the appellant did not seek to urge the opposite In our opinion the notice and the frame of the suit were therefore proper and this argument has no merit It can very well be argued that the expression joint tenants used in the deed of assignment and used in the above paragraph by their Lordships of <ORG> was meant to convey no other sense than that <NAME> and <NAME> did not take separate and exclusive interests under the assignment and that they were joint tenants in the sense that they were to hold the lease jointly and not with separate Interests therein It was observed at page column of the report That is clear from the emphasis placed by their Lordships on the circumstance that the tenants took the premises as joint tenants the deed of assignment by which they acquired the lease expressly providing that they were taking as joint tenants Where joint owners are joint tenants there is unity of title unity of interest and the right of survivorship in addition to unity of possession so that it might be said that any one of the joint tenants represents the entire estate indeed in the <ORG> case already referred to it would appear that one of the two joint tenants had died and the lease had vested solely in the other by survivorship before notice to quit was served on the other so that there was no question of the legal representatives of the deceased joint tenant having any interest whatsoever in the lease so as to require that notice should go to them The learned Judge proceeded further to observe at page column Where however the joint owners are only tenants in common there is only unity of possession not of title or interest and to determine a tenancy so held in accordance with Section of the Transfer of Property Act notice must be addressed to all the tenants though proof of service on one will be prima facie proof of service on all In the words of the section notice must go to every party intended to be bound by it and if it is not issued to any of the joint owners of the lease there is no determination of the lease so far as he is concerned A lease cannot be determined piecemeal and hence it follows that there is no determination even so far as the others are concerned The argument in the second quotation will be discussed later on but the observation in the latter part of the first quotation itself would indicate that their Lordships of <ORG> had not in their mind the consideration that <NAME> and <NAME> were owners of the tenancy as joint tenants in the special sense with the right of survivorship as an incident thereof for in that case it would have been enough for their Lordships to dispose of the controversy by merely saying that upon the death of <NAME> his interest passed to <NAME> and he became the sole lessee with no necessity in consequence of any notice going to the heirs of <NAME> or of their impleadment as defendants in the suit That case is AIR PC in which it was laid down that in the case of joint tenants each is intended to be bound and service of a notice to quit upon one joint tenant is prima facie evidence that it has reached the other joint tenants There was a suit by the landlords of a piece of land against the tenants and sub tenants who were actually in possession It may also be stated that they had come to possess what was formerly the tenancy holding of one <NAME> and that they were being treated as tenants in place of <NAME> who was treated as dead In that case notice was sent to all the seven persons separately but a contest was entered into as to whether some of them who had not been personally served with notice could be regarded as duly served The per sonal tender or delivery may take place anywhere the vicarious tender or delivery must take place at the residence of the person intended to be bound by the notice Well in the case of joint tenants each is intended to be bound and it has long ago been decided that service of a notice to quit upon one joint tenant is prima facie evidence that it has reached the other joint tenants About this case it has been argued on the appellant side that as a matter of fact notice was issued to all the seven co tenants and the notice was also held to have been sufficiently served on each one of them and in the circumstances the observation that in the case of joint tenants each is intended to be bound and service of a notice to quit upon one joint co tenant is evidence that it has reached the other joint tenants is prima facie an obiter dicta There were three English cases cited in that connection In none of these cases however the question arose whether a notice addressed to one or some only of the joint tenants and served upon him or some was sufficient to terminate the tenancy since the notice was addressed to all It was in the case AIR Cal that It was specifically decided that the notice must be addressed to all and the same view has been taken in the Kerala High Court case In the Calcutta case the <ORG> case cited above was distinguished on the ground that the notices were addressed to all the joint tenants by being sent to all of them The first case was said to have no value because in India the matter is governed by the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act About the other case it was said that the matter was left to the Jury It cannot be supposed that their Lordships of the <ORG> had not in mind the statutory provision in Section of the Transfer of Property Act when they laid down the rule that in the case of joint tenants each is intended to be bound and it has long ago been decided that service of a notice to quit upon one joint tenant is prima facie evidence that it has reached the other Ioint tenants The relevant part of Section is in the following words Every notice under this section must be in writing signed by or on behalf of the person giving it and either be sent by post to the party who is intended to be bound by it or be tendered or delivered personally to such party or to one of his family or servants at his residence or if such tender or delivery is not practicable affixed to a conspicuous part of the property One requirement under the above quoted provision is about the form of the notice namely that it should be in writing and signed by or on behalf of the person giving it In regard to service of notice it is required that it be sent by post to the party who is intended to be bound by it or be tendered or delivered personally to such party or to one of his family or servants at his residence or if such tender or delivery is not practicable affixed to a conspicuous part of the property If the words party who is intended to be bound by it are interpreted to mean each one of the co tenants where the tenancy is held by more than one person jointly then notice must be served on each one of the co tenants and that would be in direct conflict with the rule about which there is no controversy that service of a notice on one of the co tenants would be sufficient service in respect of all provided it is addressed to all The fact of its being addressed to all will be immaterial if the notice must be served on each co tenant individually in order that all of them may be bound It must be in this background that it was laid down by <ORG> in <NAME> case AIR PC that well in the case of joint tenants each is intended to be bound in other words if a notice is given to one of the joint tenants it means that the joint tenants as a whole are intended to be bound by the notice It is an incident of tenancy that it is one and even though more than one person may hold it they hold it together as one So even if a notice is addressed to one or some of the co tenants it must be effective as against all the only limitation to this being that there is nothing to show that the tenancy is intended to be terminated piecemeal and it is clear that the intention is to terminate the tenancy as a whole It appears that it is by way of this safeguard that while laying down the rule in the several decisions mentioned above that service of notice on one co tenant will be sufficient service of notice for terminating the tenancy that the qualification has been added that the notice should be addressed to all the co tenants In this connection the following passages from the report of AIR Bom which if I may say so with respect contain also my line of thinking may be usefully reproduced In this connection it is contended by the learned counsel for the appellants that the provisions of Section of Hindu Succession Act in terms lay down that property acquired by heirs who inherit by intestate succession is acquired by them as tenants in common and not as joint tenants In my judgment the phrase tenants in common or joint tenants used in Section of the Hindu Succession Act or in other texts when considering the rights of owners of property inter se cannot be confused with the right to hold land as joint tenant in the sense as joint lessees or co lessees or co tenants of property such as the subject matter of the suit The word tenant in Section is not used in the sense of lessees That word is used in the sense of owners of property whether they are joint owners of property or holding in defined shares It is an incident of ownership that has been referred to in Section and that incident in the case of persons holding as tenants in common is that the devolution in the case of each of these tenants in common would be according to the personal law while in the case of persons holding as joint tenants it will be by survivorship I accordingly hold that both on the authority of <NAME> case AIR SC aforesaid and otherwise i if it applies only to joint tenants with right of survivorship the notice served on the appellant was sufficient to terminate the tenancy since on the facts of this case it must be inferred that by the notice it was intended to terminate the tenancy as a whole and not in part Though no grounds were put forward in the courts below for the permission being invalid otherwise or without jurisdiction it has been argued in this Court that the permission is invalid and without jurisdiction for want of considering the needs of the tenant as well as required according to the Full Bench case of this Court <NAME> <NAME> All WR HC AIR All FB It is however incorrect to suggest that in the case under consideration the District Magistrate did not consider whatever case was put up by the appellant Accordingly the plea of invalidity on the new ground taken in this Court has also no substance
