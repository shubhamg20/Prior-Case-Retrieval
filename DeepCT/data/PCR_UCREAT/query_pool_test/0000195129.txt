PETITIONER <NAME> Vs RESPONDENT KHUBCHAND BAGHEL AND OTHERS DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH <NAME> RAJAGOPALA BENCH <NAME> RAJAGOPALA SINHA BHUVNESHWAR CJ <NAME> <NAME> RAGHUBAR <NAME> CITATION AIR SCR CITATOR INFO SC SC SC RF SC RF SC ACT Election Appeal to <ORG> under A Whether in computing period of limitation for filing an appeal to <ORG> time provided by of Limitation Act for getting a copy of the order can be excluded Whether a applied to cases of appeal preferred under A Relationship between the two limbs of of Limitation Act Limitation Act ss First Schedule Art Representation of the People Act A Respondent No filed an election petition challenging the election of the appellant Against the order of the <ORG> the first respondent preferred an appeal to the <ORG> under A of the Representation of the People Act Admittedly the appeal was filed more than days after the order of <ORG> If the time requisite for obtaining a copy of the order of the <ORG> was excluded the appeal was filed within days The contention of the appellant before the <ORG> was that the respondent No was not entitled in law to exclude the time taken by him in obtaining the copy of the order of the <ORG> The appellant came to this <ORG> by special leave The only question raised before this <ORG> was whether for the purpose of computing the period of days prescribed under A of the Act the provisions of of the Limitation Act could be invoked or not ii Though the right of appeal is conferred by A of the Representation of the People Act and it is by virtue thereof that the appeal was filed by respondent in the <ORG> it is still an appeal under the Code of Civil Procedure to the <ORG> of the First Schedule to the Limitation Act it is not necessary for an appeal to be an appeal under the Code of Civil Procedure that the right to prefer the appeal should be conferred by the Code of Civil Procedure It is sufficient if the procedure for the filing of the appeal and the power of the <ORG> for dealing with the appeal when filed are governed by the Code Where a right of appeal is given by some other law the appeal must be regarded as one udder that law and not under the Code of Civil Procedure There is no reason for construing the words under the Code of Civil Procedure as meaning governed in the matter of procedure by the Code of Civil Procedure Section a of the Limitation Act speaks of express exclusion and there is no express exclusion in A of the Representation of the People Act The proviso only restores the power denied to the <ORG> under of the Limitation Act An order made under of the Representation of the People Act if it contains also the reasons for it is a composite document satisfying the definition of a judgment as well as that of an order and thereby attracting the relevant provisions of of the Limitation Act If a statute provides for the making of an order and confers a right of appeal to an aggrieved party against that order within a prescribed time the time requisite for obtaining a copy of the order can be excluded The Act of empowers the <ORG> to make an order and gives a right of appeal against that order to the <ORG> and therefore is directly attracted without any recourse to the definition of an order in the Code of Civil Procedure No inconvenience is to be caused by giving a literal and natural interpretation to the expression used by the legislature in the first portion of sub of because cases of other kind can easily come under the second portion thereof The following Judgments were delivered <NAME> behalf of the Chief Justice and himself We have had the advantage of perusing the judgment of our brother <NAME> and we agree with him that the appeal should be dismissed The facts of the case have been set out in detail in the judgment of <NAME> and it is therefore unnecessary to repeat them There were three principal points that were urged before us on either side which require to be considered and all of them turn on the proper construction of of the Indian Limitation Act which we shall for convenience set out here Where any special or local law prescribes for any suit appeal or application a period of limitation different from the period prescribed therefor by the first schedule the provisions of section shall apply as if such period were prescribed therefor in that schedule and for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed for any suit appeal or application by any special or local law a the provisions contained in section sections to and section shall apply only in so far as and to the extent to which they are not expressly excluded by such special or local law and the remaining provisions of this Act shall not apply The learned Judges of <ORG> have proceeded on the basis that a applies to the case of appeals preferred under A of the Representation of the People Act and on that footing have held that the appeal presented to them by the respondent was within time if computed after making the deductions permitted by of the Limitation Act That this special or local law prescribes for an appeal a period of limitation is also evident The first point of controversy however has arisen as to whether the period of limitation prescribed by the special or local Law is different from the period prescribed therefor by the first schedule and there is a difference between the two periods It was his further contention that where the Indian Limitation Act made no provision for such an appeal and the provision contained in its a and were inapplicable Assume that the construction of the words different from urged by the appellant were accepted and this requirement would be satisfied only if the First Schedule made provision for an identical appeal as that under the special law still it was submitted by the respondent that even this was satisfied in this case For this purpose he relied on Art of the first schedule which runs Time from which Description of Period of period begins to appeal limitation run The argument was that though the right of appeal in the case before us was conferred by A of the Representation of the People Act and it was by virtue thereof that the appeal was filed by the respondent to <ORG> it was still an appeal under the Code of Civil Procedure to <ORG> For this submission learned Counsel relied principally on two decisions one of the Calcutta and the A that the right to prefer the appeal should be conferred by the Code of Civil Procedure but that it was sufficient if the procedure for the filing of the appeal and the powers of the court for dealing with the appeal were governed by that Code Article dealt with appeals to the High <ORG> from judgment rendered on the original side of that <ORG> The right to prefer these appeals was conferred by <ORG> constituting the respective High <ORG>s and not by the Code of Civil Procedure though the Code of Civil Procedure governed the procedure jurisdiction and powers of the <ORG> in dealing with the appeals so filed There would have been need therefore to except cases covered by Art only if the words under the Code of Civil Procedure were understood as meaning appeals for the disposal of which the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure was made applicable Mr <NAME> drew our attention to some decisions in which a different construction was adopted of the word under a particular enactment occurring in other Articles of the Limitation Act and in particular some dealing with appeals in certain criminal matters <ORG> shall subject to the provisions of this Act have the same powers jurisdiction and authority and follow the same procedure with respect to an appeal under this Chapter as if the appeal were an appeal from an original decree passed by a civil court situated within the local limits of its civil appellate juris diction In this view even on the narrowest construction of the words different from those prescribed therefor in first schedule occurring the opening part of the exclusion of time provided for by Art of the Limitation Act would be permissible in computing the period of limitation for filing the appeal to <ORG> in the case before us Sub section it would be seen consists of two parts The first sets out the conditions to which the special law should conform in order to attract section and that part ends with the words as if such period were prescribed therefor in that schedule This is followed by the conjunction and that word by the second part reading for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed for any suit appeal or application by any special or local law a the provisions contained in section sections to and section shall apply only in so far as and to the extent to which they are not expressly excluded by such special or local law and the remaining provisions of this Act shall not apply The question that has been debated before us is whether the condition postulated by the first limb namely the special or local law prescribing a period of limitation for a suit appeal etc different from the period prescribed therefor by the first schedule has to be satisfied in order to render the provisions of cl a applicable If on the other hand the two parts of the sub section could be read independently as if they made provision for two separate situations the result would be that the words starting from for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed for any suit appeal or application by any special or local law followed by clauses a would be an independent provi sion unrelated to the first part and therefore could operate unhampered by the condition set out in the first part In other words if the latter construction were adopted for every suit appeal or application for which a period of limitation was prescribed by a special or local law the provisions in ss to would apply unless excluded Mr <NAME> urged that the conjunction and could in the context be construed only as rendering the second limb a part and parcel of the first so that unless the conditions laid down by the opening words of the sub section were satisfied the provisions of the Limitation Act set out in cl a would not be attracted to determine the period of limitation prescribed by the special or local law The majority of the learned Judges held that the two parts of the sub section were independent and that for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed for any suit appeal or application by any special or local law The first part reads where any special or local law prescribes for any suit appeal or application a period of limitation different from the period prescribed by the first schedule the provision of shall apply as if that period was prescribed therefor in that schedule If the conditions prescribed by the opening words were satisfied of the Limitation Act would be attracted Section reads Subject to the provisions contained in sections to inclusive every suit instituted appeal preferred and application made after the period of limitation prescribed therefor by the first schedule shall be dismissed although limitation has not been set up as a defence In other words if the special or local law prescribed a period of limitation different from that prescribed by the first schedule by the application of the first part of sub the court is enabled to dismiss suits appeals and applications filed beyond time On this construction where a case satisfies the opening words of the entire group of ss to would be attracted to determine the period of limitation prescribed by the special or local law Now let us test this with reference to the second limb of treating the latter as a separate and independent provision The words italicised being perfectly general would manifestly be comprehensive to include every special or local law and among these must necessarily be included such special or local laws which satisfy the conditions specified by the first limb of We then have this strange result that by the operation of the first part ss to of the Limitation Act are made applicable to that class of special and local laws which satisfy the conditions specified by the first limb whereas by the operation of the second limb the provisions of section to to to would not apply to the same class of cases A construction which would lead to this anomalous result cannot be accepted and we therefore hold that subject to the construction we have put upon sub of both the parts are to be read as one whole and that the words following the conjunction and for the purpose of determining any period of limitation etc We agree that the appeal fails and we direct that it be dismissed with costs <NAME> by special leave raises the question of true construction of the provisions of of the Indian Limitation Act in the context of its application to A of the Representation of the People Act hereinafter called the Act The facts relevant to the question raised lie in a small compass and they are not disputed Respondent filed an election petition before the Election Commissioner of India under ss and of the Act for setting aside the election of the appellant and it was duly referred to <ORG> On February the first respondent preferred an appeal against the said order of <ORG> to <ORG> of Madhya Pradesh at Jabalpur Under sub of A of the Act every appeal under Ch IVA of the Act shall be preferred within a period of thirty days from the date of the order of the Tri bunal under or thereof If the time requisite for obtaining a copy of the order of the <ORG> was excluded the appeal was filed within days but if in law it could not be excluded the appeal would certainly be out of time The appellant contended before <ORG> that respondent I was not entitled in law to exclude the time so taken by him in obtaining a copy of the order of the <ORG> but that plea was rejected by <ORG> It is not necessary to go into the details of the judgment of<ORG> given on the merits of the case as nothingturns upon them in this appeal for the learned counsel confined his argument only to the question of limitation The present appeal has been preferred by the appellant against the said order of <ORG> setting aside his election The only question therefore is whether for the purpose of computing the period of days prescribed under A of the Act the provisions of of the Limitation Act can be invoked Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the appellant in an ela borate argument placed before us the different aspects of the question raised and I shall deal with his argument in the appropriate context in the course of my judgment At the conclusion of the trial of an election petition the <ORG> shall make an order a dismissing the election petition or declaring the election of all or any of the returned candidates to be void or Section A An appeal shall lie from every order made by a <ORG> under section or section to <ORG> in which the <ORG> is situated The High Court shall subject to the provisions of this Act have the same powers jurisdiction and authority and follow the same procedure with respect to an appeal under this Chapter as if the appeal were an appeal from an original decree passed by a civil court situated within the local limits of its civil appellate jurisdiction Every appeal under this Chapter shall be preferred within a period of thirty days from the date of the order of the <ORG> under section or section Provided that <ORG> may entertain an appeal after the expiry of the said period of thirty days if it is satis fied that the appellant had sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal within such period Where any special or local law prescribes for any suit appeal or application a period of limitation different from the period prescribed therefor by the First Schedule the provisions of section shall apply as if such period were prescribed therefor in that Schedule and for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed for any suit appeal or application by any special or local law a the provisions contained in section section to and section shall apply only in so far as and to the extent to which they are not expressly excluded by such special or local law and the remaining provisions of this Act shall not apply In computing the period of limitation prescribed for an appeal an application for leave to appeal and an application for a review of judgment the day on which the judgment complained of was pronounced and time requisite for obtaining a copy of the decree sentence or order appealed from or sought to be reviewed shall be excluded Where a decree is appealed from or sought to be reviewed the time requisite for obtaining a copy of the judgment on which it is founded shall also be excluded Section A of the Act confers a right of appeal against an order of the <ORG> under or thereof sub thereof prescribes a period of limitation of days for preferring such an appeal Section of the Limitation Act attracts by fiction the provisions of thereof to an appeal described in of the said Act with the result the provisions of sub ss and of of the Limitation Act are attracted thereto and if those sub sections were attracted in computing the period of limitation prescribed for an appeal the time requisite for obtaining a copy of the decree or order or judgment on which it is founded shall be excluded The first argument of learned counsel is that for invoking sub of of the Limitation Act the necessary condition is that the First Schedule thereto shall prescribe a period of limitation for an appeal and that a special law shall prescribe for the same type of appeal a different period of limitation and that as in the present case the First Schedule has not prescribed any period of limitation to an appeal under A of the Act against an order of the <ORG> sub of of the Act is not attracted This argument is met by learned counsel for the respondents in two ways namely i that the First Schedule to the Limitation Act has prescribed a period of limitation for such an appeal and ii that sub will apply even to a case where the First Schedule to the Limitation Act has not prescribed any period of limitation for an appeal but a special law prescribed a period of limitation for such an appeal Has the First Schedule to the Limitation Act prescribed a period of limitation for an appeal against an order of an Election <ORG> under or of the Act Article of the First Schedule to the Limitation Act says that to an appeal under the Code of Civil Procedure to <ORG> except in the cases provided for by article and article the period of limitation is days from the date of the decree or order appealed from and article referred to in article provides for an appeal against a decree or order of any of <ORG> at Fort William Madras and Bombay or of <ORG> in the exercise of its original jurisdiction of the First Schedule to the Limitation Act connote Does it mean that a right of appeal shall be conferred under the Code of Civil Procedure or does it mean that the procedure prescribed by the said Code shall apply to such an appeal A comparison of the terms of art The phraseology used in art There under of the Burma Courts Act XVII of where the amount or value of a suit or proceeding in <ORG> exceeded Rs Section of the Civil Procedure Code of which was in force at that time read Unless when otherwise expressly provided by this Code or by any other law for the time being in force an appeal shall lie from the decrees or from any part of the decrees of the <ORG> exercising original jurisdiction to the <ORG> authorized to hear appeals from the decisions of those <ORG> The effect of this provision of the Code on <ORG> was that where an appeal was not expressly excluded by any special Act an appeal lay to whatever court which under the enactment in force was the appropriate court But this section was overborne by <ORG> to the extent it conferred a right of appeal from the Recorder Court to <ORG> subject to certain conditions for of <ORG> had taken away the right of appeal of value under a prescribed amount and conferred such a right when the subject matter of the appeal was between two prescribed amounts from the decree of the Recorder Court to <ORG> The learned Judges observed thus at Now what is meant by an appeal under the Civil Procedure Code A particular appeal was given by <ORG> and <ORG> is still the only Act which prescribes to what Court this appeal shall lie when it speaks of the Civil Pro cedure Code is on the face of it speaking of a Code which relates to procedure and does not ordinarily deal with substantive rights and the natural meaning of an appeal under the Civil Procedure Code appears to us to be an appeal governed by the Code of Civil Procedure so far as procedure is concerned The right of appeal was conferred under the Land Acquisition Act but the procedure prescribed by the Code of Civil Procedure governed that appeal There seems to be no good reason for saying that an appeal under the Civil Procedure Code means only an appeal the right to prefer which is conferred by the Code itself On the other hand it would not be straining the language of the article too much to hold that an appeal the procedure with respect to which from its inception to its disposal is governed by the Civil Procedure Code may rightly be spoken of as an appeal under the Code That also tends to show that what is meant by the legislature is appeals the hearing and disposal of which is governed by the rules of procedure laid down in the Civil Procedure Code No direct decision has been brought to our notice which has differed from or even questioned the correctness of this decision Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the appellant brought to our notice a number of decisions which considered the forum to which an appeal shall lie against an order under of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the procedure to be followed therein <NAME> <NAME> held that in such an appeal the appellate Court could exercise its power under It is said that the combined effect of these decisions is that the procedure applicable in an appeal against an order made by a civil court under of the Code of Criminal Procedure is that prescribed by the Code of Civil Procedure whereas the period of limitation is that prescribed for an appeal under the Code of Criminal Procedure The complainant preferred an appeal to the District Judge more than days prescribed under art The learned District Judge held that no question of limitation arose for the District Judge suo motu could lodge a complaint in the criminal court when an offence in connection with the administration of civil justice came to his notice of the Limitation Act it should have been filed within days from the date of the order of the Subordinate court It will be noticed that no argument was raised in that case that the appeal was governed by the Code of Civil Procedure and therefore the appropriate article of the Limitation Act was not art Even so it is contended that under A of the Act <ORG> though it has the same powers jurisdiction and authority of an appellate court governed by the Code of Civil Procedure is not empowered to follow the procedure prescribed under the Code in respect of receiving the appeals Under that sub section <ORG> shall subject to the provisions of this Act have the same powers jurisdiction and authority and follow the same procedure with respect to an appeal under this Chapter as if the appeal were an appeal from an original decree passed by a civil court situated within the local limits of its civil appellate jurisdiction Under the second part of sub of A of the Act a fiction is created namely that though a right of appeal is conferred by A of the Act the appeal thereunder for the purpose of sub will be deemed to be an appeal from an original decree passed by a civil court situated within the local limits of its civil apPellate jurisdiction What does the word procedure mean The procedure must necessarily be the procedure governing such an appeal If that part was excluded how could the appeal be received in <ORG> The answer given is that the Government might make rules under of the Act When confers a statutory power on <ORG> to follow the procedure prescribed by the Code of Civil Procedure we cannot invoke the general power of <ORG> to make rules under of the Act For the aforesaid reasons I hold that the special law namely the Act prescribes a period of limitation different from the period prescribed therefor by the First Schedule to the Limitation Act within the meaning of art If so of the Limitation Act is attracted and the st respondent was entitled to exclude the time taken by him for obtaining the copy of the order of Schedule to the Limitation Act did not prescribe a period of limitation for the kind of appeal under consideration the question arises whether sub of of the Limitation Act would not be appli cable if no period was prescribed by the First Schedule for an appeal created by a special law but the special law pres cribed a period of limitation for the same The first Limitation Act was passed in the year Act XIV of Section of that act provided When by any law now or hereafter to be in force a shorter period of limitation than that prescribed by this Act is specially prescribed for the institution of a particular suit such shorter period of limitation shall be applied notwithstanding this Act Section of that Act which is relevant to the present inquiry read When by any law not mentioned in the schedule hereto annexed and now or hereafter to be in force in any part of British India a period of limitation differing from that prescribed by this Act is especially prescribed for any suits appeals or applications nothing herein contained shall affect such law Section of this Act read When by any special or local law now or hereafter in force in British India a period of limitation is especially prescribed for any suit appeal or application nothing herein contained shall affect or alter the period so prescribed The same provision was retained in the Limitation Act IX of but it was amended in the year in the present form Before the amendment of there was a difference of view on the following questions namely whether the general provisions of the Limitation Act where the word prescribed alone without reference to any Act was used or even where that word was not used would be applicable to special or local laws and whether the general provisions of the Limitation Act did not apply at all to the periods of limitation prescribed by special or local laws Decisions holding that the general provisions of the Limitation Act did not apply to periods of limitations prescribed by other laws relied upon the expression affect or alter used in the section as it then stood Section of the Limitation Act was amended to remove the conflict with a view to make the general provisions applicable to the period of limitation prescribed by special or local laws A comparison of the phraseology of the earlier sections shows that while of the Limitation Act of used the words shorter period of the Act of used the expression differing and of the Acts of and removed both the expressions The result was that of the Act of saved all the special or local laws which prescribed a special period of limitation from the operation of the provisions of the Limitation Act As the section then stood it applied to all special or local laws prescribing a period of limitation whether the Limitation Act prescribed any period of limitation or not for suits or appeals similar to those governed by special or local laws or where the period of limitation so prescribed by special or local laws was shorter or longer than that prescribed in the Limitation Act Can it be said that by the Amending Act of a conscious departure was made by the <ORG> to impose a condition for the application of sub of namely that a period of limitation should have been expressly prescribed by the First Schedule to the Limitation Act in respect of a suit or appeal governed by the special or local law There was no occasion for such a departure To put it in other words apart from resolving the conflict did the <ORG> intend to exclude a particular category of proceedings governed by special or local laws from the operation of the benefit conferred by sub of No justification was suggested for such a departure and we find none The scheme of the Limitation Act may be briefly stated thus The preamble to the Act shows that it was passed to consolidate and amend the laws relating to the law of limitation in respect of the proceedings mentioned in the Act It applies to the whole of India in the third division prescribes for application for which no period of limitation is prescribed elsewhere in the Schedule or by of the Code of Civil Procedure It follows that there is no period of limitation for an appeal not provided for in the second division unless the special or local law prescribes for it When the First Schedule of the Limitation Act prescribes no time limit for a particular appeal but the special law prescribes a time limit to it can it not be said that under the First Schedule of the Limitation Act an appeal can be filed at any time but the special law by limiting it provides for a different period While the former permits the filing of an appeal at any time the latter limits it to the prescribed period sense that it departs from the period of limitation fixed for various appeals under the Limitation Act If the first Schedule to the Limitation Act omits laying down any period of limitation for a particular appeal and the special law provides a period of limitation then to that extent the special law is different from the Limitation Act We are conscious of the fact that the language used by the <ORG> is perhaps not very happy but we must put upon it a construction which will reconcile the various difficulties caused by the other sections of the Limitation Act and which will give effect to the object which obviously the <ORG> had in mind because if we were to give to the meaning which Mr <NAME> contends for then the result would be that even of the Limitation Act would not apply to this special law The result would be that although an appeal may be barred by limitation it would not be liable to be dismissed under The learned Judges expressed conflicting views <NAME> assumed that the first limb of the sub section did not apply to a case where the schedule omitted to provide for a period of limitation <NAME> speaking for the <ORG> stated thus A special law may provide a period of limitation and schedule I may omit to do so from the period prescribed therefor by the first schedule occurring in cannot be construed as meaning that schedule must also positively prescribe the period of limitation The learned Chief Justice proceeded to consider the ano malous position that would arise if a literal construction was given to the provisions of the first part of the section consider this question incidentally in the context of the application of of the Limitation Act to an application for special leave to appeal against an order of acquittal under sub of of the Code of Criminal Procedure The Limitation Act does not provide any period of limitation for an application for special leave to appeal from an order of acquittal under the said section But this <ORG> held that of the Limitation Act applied but that section excluded the application of to the said application <NAME> speaking for the <ORG> observed Hence it may be said that there is no limitation prescribed by the Limitation Act for an A I appeal against an order of acquittal at the instance of a private prosecutor Thus there is a difference between the Limitation Act and the rule laid down in of the Code in respect of limitation affecting such an application Section is supplemental in its character in so far as it provides for the application of to such cases as would not come within its purview but for this provision This observation clearly supports the position that would apply even to a case where a difference between the special law and the Limitation Act arose by the omission to provide for a limitation to a particular proceeding under the Limitation Act therefore hold that in the instant case the Act provides a period of limitation different from that prescribed therefor by the First Schedule to the Limitation Act and therefore it is governed by of the said Act Even if my view on the construction of the first limb of of the Limitation Act were wrong it would not help the appellant for his case squarely falls within the scope of the second limb of the section and for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed for any suit appeal or application by any special or focal law He further argues that if it is not a limitation but an independent clause it will lead to the anomaly of ss to of the Limitation Act applicable to proceedings failing under the first part and only some of the provisions thereof namely ss to and apply ing to the second part of the section Apart from the grammatical construction which I will consider presently I do not see any anomaly in ss to of the Limitation Act applying to the first part of the section and only some of them applying to the second part thereof Those proceedings to which the first part applies by fiction the period prescribed in the special or local law is treated as prescribed in the First Schedule itself But the same cannot be said in the case of the proceedings of a different type not provided for in the First Schedule A construction which will leave without effect any part of the language of a statute will normally be rejected or to put it in a positive form the <ORG> shall ordinarily give meaning to every word used in the section Does the conjunction and make the following clause a limitation on the preceding one No rule of grammatical construction has been brought to our notice which requires an interpretation that if sentences complete by themselves are connected by a conjunction the second sentence must be held to limit the scope of the first sentence But if the interpretation suggested by the learned counsel be accepted we would not be giving any meaning at all to the word any used thrice in the second part of the section namely any period any suit and any special or local law If the second part is a limitation on the first part the sentence should read for the purpose of determining the period of limitation prescribed for such suit appeal or application by such special or local law There is no reason why we should attribute such a grammatical deficiency to the legislature when every word in the second part of the section can be given full and satisfactory meaning It was then said that A of the Act provided an exhaustive and exclusive code of limitation for the purpose of appeals against orders of tribunals and reliance is placed on the proviso to sub of that section which reads Every appeal under this Chapter shall be preferred within a period of thirty days from the date of the order of the <ORG> under section or section Provided that <ORG> may entertain an appeal after the expiry of the said period of thirty days if it is satisfied that the appellant had sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal within such period There are two answers to this argument Firstly a of the Limitation Act speaks of express exclusion but there is no express exclusion in sub of A of the Act secondly the proviso from which an implied exclusion is sought to be drawn does not lead to any such necessary implication therefore hold that the proviso to sub of A of the Act only restores the power denied to the court under of the Limitation Act Elaborating the argument it is said that in order to exclude the time for obtaining a copy of the order appealed against the original shall be a decree or order within the meaning of or judgment within the meaning of of the Limitation Act and the order under of the Act is neither a decree nor an order or a judgment within the meaning of the said sub sections of of the Limitation Act Under sub of of the Code of Civil Procedure judgment is defined to mean the statement given by the judge of the grounds of a decree or order It follows from the said definitions that judgment is a statement of the reasons given by the judge and order is the formal expression of his decision Section of the said Code says An appeal shall lie from the following orders and save as otherwise expressly provided in the body of this Code or by any law for the time being in force from no other orders Under of the Code The procedure provided in this Code in regard to suits shall be followed as far as it can be made applicable in all proceedings in any court of civil jurisdiction The effect of these provisions is that a decree is a formal expression of adjudication conclusively determining the rights of parties with regard to all or any of the controversies in a suit whereas order is a formal expression of any decision of a civil court which is not a decree Judgment is a statement given by the judge of his grounds in respect of a decree or order With this background let me look at the provisions of A of the Act Under sub thereof an appeal shall lie from every order made by a <ORG> under or to <ORG> of the State in which the <ORG> is situated Under of the Act At the conclusion of the trial of an election petition the <ORG> shall make an order a dismissing the election petition or declaring the election of all or any of the returned candidates to be void or declaring the election of all or any of the returned candidates to be void and the petitioner or any other candidate to ave been duly elected Part VI of the Act provides for disputes regarding elections Ch III thereof prescribes the procedure for the trial of election petitions and therein says Subject to the provisions of this Act and of any rules made thereunder every election petition shall be tried by the <ORG> as nearly as may be in accordance with the procedure applicable under the Code of Civil Procedure to the trial of suits As under of the Act the Election <ORG> is directed to try election petitions as nearly as may be in accordance with the pro cedure applicable under the Code of Civil Procedure it is the duty of the Election <ORG> to give a statement of reasons for its decision If so it is manifest that an order made under of the Act if it contains also the reasons for it is a composite document satisfying the definition of a judgment as well as that of an order and thereby attracting the relevant provisions of of the Limitation Act If a statute provides for the making of can order and confers a right of appeal to an aggrieved party against that order within a prescribed time sub of of the Limitation Act says that the time requisite for obtaining a copy of such order shall be excluded In either view of the Limitation Act applies and therefore the time taken for obtaining a copy of the said order shall be excluded in computing the period of limitation <NAME> that the appeal be dismissed but for different reasons I am of opinion that the first part of of the Limi tation Act applies only when a special or local law prescribes a period of limitation for an appeal and when for that particular appeal a period of limitation is prescribed in the First Schedule to the Limitation Act as omission to prescribe a period of limitation cannot be equated with the prescribing of any positive period of limitation within which the appeal should be filed and that the second part of of the Act is independent of the first part and can apply to cases to which the first part does not apply of the First Schedule applies to appeals which are instituted in view of the right of appeal conferred by any special or local law and not in pursuance of the provisions of I do not elaborate my views as I agree with what my learned brother <NAME> has said in construing the first part of of the Limitation Act and art The proviso to a of the Representation of the People Act gives discretion to <ORG> to entertain an appeal presented after the expiry of days from the date of the order of the <ORG> in case it is satisfied that there is sufficient cause for the late presentation of the memorandum of appeal The respondent has applied in this Court for the condonation of the delay in filing the appeal in <ORG> There was a difference of opinion in <ORG>s regarding the applicability of of the Limitation Act to such appeals The Election <ORG> passed the order on January and the appeal was filed on February I am satisfied that there was sufficient cause for the respondent not presenting the appeal within the period of limitation <NAME> agree with my brother <NAME> that the appeal should be dismissed I regret my inability to agree with all the reasons which he has given I need not recapitulate the facts which have been set out fully in the judgment prepared by my learned brother but I would only state the point which we have to consider in this appeal The point is whether for the purpose of computing the period of days prescribed by A of the Representation of the People Act under which an appeal can be preferred from the decision of <ORG> the provisions of sub of the Limita tion Act whereunder the time requisite for obtaining a copy of the decree and the day on which the judgment complained of was pronounced can be excluded can be pressed in aid It was contended before us that the appeal should be deemed to be one under the Code of Civil Procedure in which case it would fall under art Alternatively it was argued that the first limb of sub of the Limitation Act would also apply to an appeal under the Representation of the People Act even though it does not fall under art of the Limitation Act since a different period of limitation was prescribed for it from that prescribed for an appeal in the First Schedule of the Limitation Act and that therefore cl a thereof would attract of the Limitation Act Finally it was argued that even if the appeal cannot be regarded as one falling within the first limb of sub of would still apply because the second limb of sub of is wide enough in its ambit to include a suit appeal or application for which no period of limitation is prescribed in the first schedule but a period of limitation has been prescribed by a special or local law He has also held that the words where any special or local law prescribes for any suit appeal or application a period of limitation different from the period prescribed therefor by the first schedule occurring in the first limb of sub of would include a suit or an appeal even though it is not of a type for which a period of limitation is prescribed in the First Schedule because it is enough if the special law prescribes for such an appeal a period which is different from any period prescribed in the First Schedule Finally however my learned brother has construed the second limb of sub of and for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed for any suit appeal or application by any special or local law as being wide enough to include a suit appeal or an application under a special or local law which is of a type for which no period of limitation is prescribed in the First Schedule In my judgment what he has said on the last point is enough for the purpose of disposing of the appeal in the way proposed by him As however I do not agree with what he has said on the first two points I must briefly indicate my reasons for coming to different conclusions Section of the Code of Civil Procedure which was in force at that time read thus Unless when otherwise expressly provided by this Code or by any other law for the time being in force an appeal shall lie from the decrees or from any part of the decrees of the <ORG> exercising original jurisdiction to the <ORG> authorised to hear appeals from the decisions of those courts The question which <ORG> had to consider in that case was whether the appeal could be said to be in time as it fell to be governed by art For deciding this matter <ORG> proceeded to consider what was meant by an appeal under the Code of Civil Procedure when it speaks of the Civil Procedure Code is on the face of it speaking of a Code which relates to procedure and does not ordinarily deal with substantive rights and the natural meaning of an appeal under the Civil Procedure Code appears to us to be an appeal governed by the Code of Civil Procedure so far as procedure is concerned I would assume that <ORG> was right but it is necessary to point out that the provisions of of the Limitation Act as then in force did not come for considera tion in that case With respect I do not think that there was any warrant for holding that an appeal which was not given by the Code would still be one under the Code merely because the procedural provisions thereof would govern its course Where the right of appeal is given by some other law the appeal must be regarded as one under that law and not under the Code I see no valid reason for construing the words under the Code of Civil Procedure as meaning governed in the matter of procedure by the Code of Civil Procedure For that is in effect what <ORG> has done in this case By reading the article in the way it has done <ORG> has virtually construed the only provision in the Limitation Act dealing with normal civil appeals to <ORG> as a residuary article which would take in all appeals by whatever law they may be provided merely because the procedure relating to appeals contained in the Code of Civil Procedure was applicable to them Indeed while a right to institute a suit or make an application is a wider kind of right Article is one of the eight article contained in the second division which deals with appeals Article makes provision for applications for which no period of limitation is prescribed elsewhere in the Schedule In the second division however which deals with appeals there is no provision analogous to art It is not couched in language similar to that used in art or The <ORG> knew that appeals have been provided by various special laws but it made no provision for such appeals in this Schedule appa rently for the reason that a law which confers a right of appeal is expected to provide for the period of limitation for such an appeal XLI of the Code of Civil Procedure were not applicable to an appeal under the Representation of the People Act there would be no provision whereunder the party could at all file an appeal It seems to me however that there can be no difficulty at all in this matter as every High Court has made rules partly under the Constitution and partly in exercise of its inherent power to make suitable provisions in regard to this and allied matters and that is another reason why I find myself unable to accept the correctness of the view it has taken in that case In other words it is the principle that judicial decisions have a binding character In any case the decision of a <ORG> has no more than persuasive character in so far as this <ORG> is concerned dissented from for a long time but has on the other hand been followed it is not entitled to be treated as immutable particularly where it deals only with a question appertaining to the adjective law such as the law of limitation There may be a great deal to be said in favour of not disturbing even erroneous decisions affecting substantive rights to property which have stood undisturbed for a long time on the ground that such a course may unsettle existing titles to property But this or similar considerations which would justify leaving such decisions undisturbed would not stand in the way of overruling an erroneous decision on a matter appertaining to the adjective law however ancient the decision may be They run thus Where any special or local law prescribes for any suit appeal or application a period of limitation different from the period prescribed therefor by the First Schedule the provisions of section shall apply as if such period were prescribed therefor in that Schedule and for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed for any suit appeal or application by any special or local law a the Provisions contained in section sections to and section shall apply only in so far as and to the extent to which they are not expressly excluded by such special or local law and the remaining provisions of this Act shall not apply The legislature has in clear terms spoken of cases in which a special or local law has prescribed for a suit appeal or an application a period of limitation different from that prescribed by the First Schedule I do not think that any inconvenience would be caused by giving literal and natural interpretation to the expression used by the legislature in the first portion of sub of because cases of other kind can easily come under the second portion thereof Since I agree with my learned brother about what he has said regarding the second limb of sub of the aapeal must be dismissed with costs as proposed by him
