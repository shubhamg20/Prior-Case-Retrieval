Criminal Procedure Code Act II of Sections to Special Judge taking cognizance of offence under the Prevention of Corruption Act Act of on a private complaint in respect of the said offences committed by Public Servants legality of Criminal Law Amendment Act XLVI of Section to Scope of <ORG> of Special Judge is a <ORG> of Original Criminal Jurisdiction and shall have all powers except those specifically excluded HEADNOTE Respondent <NAME> filed a private complaint against the appellant alleging that the appellant has as a public servant committed certain offences under ss A and A of the Prevention of Corruption Act Act II of and section of the Indian Penal Code before the learned Special Judge Shri <NAME> The Special Judge took cognizance of the said offences and adjourned the case to October on which date the appellants counsel moved an application questioning the jurisdiction of the court on two specific counts i that the <ORG> of special Judge act up under of the Criminal Law Amendment Act Act for short cannot take cognizance of any of the offences enumerated in a upon a private complaint of facts constituting the offence and ii that where there are more special Judges than one for any area in the absence of a specification by the State Government in this behalf specifying the local area over which each special Judge would have jurisdiction the special Judge Mr <NAME> had no jurisdiction to take cognizance of the offences and try the case The learned special Judge rejected both the contentions The learned Judges by two separate but concurring judgments held that special Judge is competent and is entitled to take cognizance of offences set out in a upon a private complaint of facts constituting the offence and consequently rejected the first contention In reaching this conclusion the learned Judges held that a prior investigation under A of the Prevention of Corruption Act Act for short by a police officer of the designated rank is not a condition precedent to the special Judge taking cognizance of the offences under of Act and taking notice of the Notification dated January issued by the Maharashtra State under sub of of Act specifying <NAME> Special Judge for Greater Bombay for trying the Special Case No of rejected the second contention and therefore the revision petition as well A private complaint filed in respect of the offences committed by public servants as enumerated in and of the Criminal Law Amendment Act can be entertained by the special Judge and taken cognizance of It is a well recognised principle of criminal jurisprudence that anyone can set or put the criminal law into motion except where the statute enacting or creating an offence indicates to the contrary Locus Standi of the complaint is a concept foreign to criminal jurisprudence save and except that where the statute creating an offence provides for the eligibility of the complaint by necessary implication the general principle gets excluded by such statutory provision A This general principle of nearly universal application is founded on a policy that an offence i an act or omission made punishable by any law for the time being in force See Cr is not merely an offence committed in relation to the person who suffers harm but is also an offence against society If such is the public policy underlying penal statutes who brings an act or omission made punishable by law to the notice of the authority competent to deal with it is immaterial and irrelevant unless the statute indicates to the contrary Punishment of the offender in the interest of the society being one of the objects behind penal statutes enacted for larger good of the society right to initiate proceedings cannot be whittled down circumscribed or fettered by putting it into a straight jacket formula of locus standi unknown to criminal jurisprudence save and except specific statutory exception To hold that such an exception exists that a private complaint for offences of corruption committed by public servant is not maintainable the court would require an unambiguous statutory provision and a tengled web of argument for drawing a far fetched implication cannot be a substitute for an express statutory provision A It is no answer to this fairly well established legal position that for the last years no case has come to the notice of the court in which cognizance was taken by a special Judge in a private complaint for offences punishable under the Act If the offence complained of is a non cognizable one the Police Officer can either direct the complaint to approach the Magistrate or he may obtain permission of the Magistrate and investigate the offence One would therefore require a cogent and explicit provision to hold that A displaces this scheme Section of the Act which confers power on the special Judge to take cognizance of offences set out in a does not directly or indirectly expressly or by necessary implication indicate that the only method of taking cognizance is the police report under of the Code of Criminal Procedure submitted by a police officer of the designated rank or permissible rank as set out in A of the Prevention of Corruption Act In the absence of a specific provision made in the statute indicating that offences will have to be investigated inquired into tried and otherwise dealt with according to that statute the same will have to be investigated inquired into tried and otherwise dealt with according to the Code of Criminal Procedure In other words Code of Criminal Procedure is the parent statute which provides for investigation inquiring into and trial of cases by criminal courts of various designations If <ORG> of special Judge is a criminal court which atleast was not disputed and jurisdiction is conferred upon the presiding officer of the <ORG> of special Judge to take cognizance of offences simultaneously excluding one out of the four recognised modes of taking cognizance namely upon commitment of by a Magistrate as set out in the only other method by which the <ORG> of special Judge can take cognizance of an offence for the trial of which it was set up is any one of the remaining three other methods known to law by which a criminal court would take cognizance of an offence not as an idle formality but with a view to initiating proceedings and ultimately to try the accused If the language employed in is read in this light and in the background that a special Judge may take cognizance of offence without the accused being committed to him for trial it necessarily implies that the <ORG> of special Judge is armed with power to take cognizance without commitment by the Magistrate Thus the special Judge can take cognizance of offences enumerated in a and upon a complaint or upon a police report or upon his coming to know in some manner of the offence having been committed Section of Act says that the special Judge shall take cognizance of an offence and shall not take it on commitment of the accused It positively conferred power on special Judge to take cognizance of offences and it negatively removed any concept of commitment This has no hearing either directly or indirectly with the mode and method of taking cognizance or trial by the special Judge Therefore an investigation under A is not a condition precedent before cognizance can be taken of offences triable by a special Judge who acquires power under to take cognizance of offences enumerated in a and of the Prevention of Corruption Act with this limitation alone that it shall not be upon commitment to him by the Magistrate Once A is out of the way in the matter of taking cognizance of offences committed by public servants by a special Judge the power of the special Judge to take cognizance of such offences conferred by with only one limitation in any one of the known methods of taking cognizance of offences by courts of original jurisdiction remains undented One such statutorily recognised well known method of taking cognizance of offences by a court competent to take cognizance is upon receiving a comp laint of facts which constitutes the offence And says that the special Judges has the power to take cognizance of offences enumerated in a and the only mode of taking cognizance excluded by the provision is upon commitment It therefore follows that the special Judge can take cognizance of offences committed by public servants upon receiving a complaint of facts constituting such offences There is no warrant for an approach that on receipt of the complaint the special Judge must direct an investigation under A In order to give full effect to the only thing to do is to read special Judge in to wherever the expression Magistrate occurs This is what is called legislation by incorporation Similarly where the question of taking cognizance arises it is futile to go in search of the fact whether for purposes of which conferred power on the Magistrate to take cognizance of the offence special Judge is a Magistrate What is to be done is that one has to read the expression special in place of Magistrate and the whole thing becomes crystal clear The <ORG> wherever it found the grey area clarified it by making specific provision such as the one in sub of and to leave no one in doubt further provided in sub that all the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure shall so far as they are not inconsistent with the Act apply to the proceedings before a special Judge It did not envisage any <ORG> of a special Judge and the <ORG> never wanted to draw up an exhaustive Code of Procedure for this new criminal court which was being set up Therefore it conferred power taking cognizance of offences prescribed procedure trial of warrant cases by a Magistrate indicated authority to tender pardon The net outcome of this position is that a new court of original jurisdiction was set up and whenever a question arose as to what are its powers in respect of specific questions brought before it as court of original criminal Jurisdiction it had to refer to the Code of Criminal Procedure undaunted by any designation clap trap The deeming fiction enacted in is confined to the limits of its requirement in that the person conducting a prosecution before a special Judge is to be deemed to be a public prosecutor On the contrary conscious of the position that a private complaint may be filed before a special Judge who may take cognizance of the offences on such a complaint the <ORG> wanted to clothe the person in charge of the prosecution before a special Judge with the status of a public prosecutor for the purposes of the Code of Criminal Procedure The power to take cognizance without holding inquiry or directing investigation is implicit in of the Code Therefore the matter is left to the judicial discretion of the <ORG> whether on examining the complainant and the witnesses if any as contemplated by to issue process or to postpone the issue of process Therefore there is no merit in the contention that by entertaining a private complaint the purpose of speedy trial would be thwarted or that a pre process safeguard would be denied Further when cognizance is taken on a private complaint or to be precise otherwise than on a police report the special Judge has to try the case according to the procedure prescribed for trial of warrant cases instituted otherwise than on police report by a Magistrate ss Prior to the procedure for trial of warrant cases instituted on a police report and otherwise than on police report was the same and the Act of set up the court of special Judge to try cases under the Act and the trial was to be held according to the procedure prescribed for trial of a warrant case It necessarily follows that between to the <ORG> of special Judge would have followed the same procedure for trial of a case instituted upon a police report or otherwise than on a police report The entire argument inviting the court to specifically decide whether a court of a special Judge for a certain purpose is a court Magis trate or court of Sessions revolves round a mistaken belief that a special Judge has to be one or the other and must fit in the slot of a Magistrate or a <ORG> of Sessions Such an approach would strangulate the functioning of the court and must be eschewed As a court of original criminal jurisdiction in order to make it functionally oriented some powers were conferred by the statute setting up the court Except those specifically conferred and specifically denied it has to function as a court of original criminal jurisdiction not being hide bound by the terminological status description of Magistrate or a <ORG> of Sessions Under the Code it will enjoy all powers which a court of original criminal jurisdiction enjoys save and except the ones specifically denied The <ORG> of a special Judge once created by an independent statute has been brought as a court of original criminal jurisdiction under <ORG> because confers on <ORG> all the powers conferred by Chapter XXXI and XXXIII of the Code of Criminal Procedure on a High <ORG> as if the court of Special Judge were a <ORG> of Sessions trying cases without a jury within the local limit of the jurisdiction of <ORG> The Judgment of the court was delivered by <ORG> This appeal by special leave is directed against the decision of <ORG> of <ORG> in Criminal Revision Application No of which was preferred by the appellant against the rejection of his application by the learned special Judge as per his order dated October After the learned special Judge <NAME> took cognizance of the offences upon a complaint of <NAME> the first respondent Original complainant the case was adjourned to October for recording the evidence of the complainant On that day learned counsel appearing for the appellant in the trial court moved an application questioning the jurisdiction of the court on two specific counts i that <ORG> set up under Sec a and upon a private complaint of facts constituting the offence and ii that where there are more special Judges than one for any area in the absence of a specification by <ORG> in this behalf specifying the local area over which each special Judge would have jurisdiction the special Judge Mr <NAME> had no jurisdiction to take cognizance of the offences and try the case The learned special Judge rejected both the contentions a and upon a private complaint of facts constituting the offence and consequently rejected the first contention A of the Prevention of Corruption Act Act for short by a police officer of the designated rank is not a condition precedent to the special Judge taking cognizance of the offences under Sec The learned Judges also held that by the time the matter was heard by them the Government of Maharashtra had issued a notification dated January under sub of Sec A a condition precedent to the taking of the cognizance of an offence or offences committed by a public servant by the special Judge On behalf of the respondent complainant it was urged that it is one of the fundamental postulates of the administration of criminal justice that anyone can set the criminal law into motion unless the statute enacting the offence makes a special provision to the contrary both with regard to the locus standi of the complainant the manner and method of investigation and the person competent to investigate the offence and the court competent to take cognizance which specifically confers power on the special Judge to take cognizance of an offence without commitment of the case to it there is nothing which would preclude a complainant from filing a private complaint or which would deny jurisdiction of the special Judge to take cognizance of the offences on such a private complaint A is treated as mandatory and incorporates a safeguard it is a safeguard against investigation of offences committed by a public servant by police officers of lower rank and nothing more A denies the power to the special Judge to take cognizance of offences enumerated in Sec An incidental submission was that the <ORG> clearly expresses itself when it requires a certain qualification for filing the complaint and to specify a certain court competent to take cognizance and the method and manner of taking cognizance of those specified offences To substantiate this submission our attention was drawn to a number of statutes which we will presently mention A upon its true interpretation and keeping in view that it enacts a mandatory safeguard in favour of public servants investigation therein contemplated is a condition precedent to taking cognizance of offences enumerated in Sec It is a well recognised principle of criminal jurisprudence that anyone can set or put the criminal law into motion except where the statute enacting or creating an offence indicates to the contrary This general principle of nearly universal application is founded on a policy that an offence i an act or omission made punishable by any law for the time being in force See Sec is not merely an offence committed in relation to the person who suffers harm but is also an offence against society If such is the public policy underlying penal statutes who brings an act or omission made punishable by law to the notice of the authority competent to deal with it is immaterial and irrelevant unless the statute indicates to the contrary Punishment of the offender in the interest of the society being one of the objects behind penal statutes enacted for larger good of the society right to initiate proceedings cannot be whittled down circumscribed or fettered by putting it into a straight jacket formula of locus standi unknown to criminal jurisprudence save and except specific statutory exception To hold that such an exception exists that a private complaint for offences of corruption committed by public servant is not maintainable the court would require an unambiguous statutory provision and a tangled web of argument for drawing a far fetched implication cannot be a substitute for an express statutory provision the <ORG> while conferring power to take cognizance had three opportunities to unambiguously state its mind whether the cognizance can be taken on a private complaint or not itself by merely stating that the special Judge may take cognizance of an offence on a police report submitted to it by an investigating officer conducting investigation as contemplated by Sec While providing for investigation by designated police officers of superior rank the <ORG> did not fetter the power of special Judge to take cognizance in a manner otherwise than on police report The disinclination of the <ORG> to so provide points to the contrary and no canon of construction permits the court to go in search of a hidden or implied limitation on the power of the special Judge to take cognizance unfettered by such requirement of its being done on a police report alone In our opinion it is no answer to this fairly well established legal position that for the last years no case has come to the notice of the court in which cognizance was taken by a special Judge in a private complaint for offences punishable under the Act If the offence complained of is a non cognizable one the Police Officer can either direct the complainant to approach the Magistrate or he may obtain permission of the Magistrate and investigate the offence One would therefore require a cogent and explicit provision to hold that Sec A was first introduced in the Act in the year of the Act which made the offences under Secs There was an identical provision in sub of Sec A makes a provision for investigation by police officers of higher rank Chapter XII of the Code of Criminal Procedure bears the heading Information to the police and their powers to investigate It casts a duty on the officer in charge of a police station to reduce to writing every information relating to commission of a cognizable offence given to him and the same will be read over to the informant and the same shall be signed by the informant and a copy thereof shall be given to him If information given to an officer in charge of a Police Station disclosed a non cognizable offence he has to enter the substance of the information in a book to be kept by such officer in such form as <ORG> may prescribe in this behalf and to refer the informant to the Magistrate Sec Sub puts an embargo on the power of the police officer in charge of the police station to investigate a non cognizable offence without the order of a Magistrate having power to try the case or commit the case for trial sets out the powers of the officer in charge of police station to investigate cognizable cases It says that no proceeding of a police officer in any such case shall at any stage be called in question on the ground that the case was one which such officer was not empowered under the section to investigated Sub confers power on the Magistrate empowered under Sec provides that subject to the provisions of the Chapter any Magistrate of the first class and any Magistrate of the second class specially empowered in this behalf under sub sec may take cognizance of any offence a upon receiving a complaint of facts which constitute such offence upon a police report of such facts and upon information received from any person other than a police officer or upon his own knowledge that such offence has been committed obliges the Magistrate when he takes cognizance of an offence under clause of sub sec provides that except as otherwise expressly provided in the Code or by any other law for the time being in force no court of Session shall take cognizance of any offence as a court of original jurisdiction unless the case has been committed to it by a Magistrate under the Code Cognizable offence has been defined in Sec to mean an offence for which and cognizable case means a case in which a police officer may in accordance with the First Schedule or under any law for the time being in force arrest without warrant to mean any allegation made orally or in writing to a Magistrate with a view to his taking action under the Code that some person whether known or unknown has committed an offence but does not include a police report There is an explanation appended to the section which has some relevance A report made by a police officer in a case which disclosed after investigation the commission of a non cognizable offence shall be deemed to be a complaint and the police officer by whom such report is made shall be deemed to be the complainant defines non cognizable offence to mean an offence for which and non cognizable case means a case in which a police officer has no authority to arrest without warrant IPC give information of the offence and an officer of the level of a Head constable of Police can start investigation to the chagrin and annoyance of a public servant who may be a highly placed officer <ORG> being aware that once these two offences are made cognizable a police officer of the rank of Head constable would be entitled to initiate investigation against the public servant who may as well be highly placed officer in police revenue taxation or other departments which reads as under Provided that a police officer below the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police shall not investigate any such offences without the order of a Magistrate of the First Class or make any arrest therefor without a warrant While investigating a cognizable offence the investigating officer who is an officer in charge of a police station has a right to arrest the accused without a warrant On these offences being made cognizable in order to protect public servant from being arrested by a petty police officer as well to avoid investigation of an offence of corruption being conducted by police officers below the specified rank the proviso was enacted thereby depriving low level police officers from exercising this drastic power However <ORG> was aware that an officer of a rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police may not always be available and to guard against offences going undetected a further power was conferred that although ordinarily the offence by public servant under the aforementioned sections shall not be investigated by an officer below the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police the Magistrate of the first class can grant permission to an officer of the lower rank to investigate the offence in teeth of the statute In larger public interest non availability of such higher officers was catered to by conferring power on the Magistrate of the first class to grant permission to an officer of the rank lower than the designated officer to investigate such offences A specifies the officers of superior rank in police force on whom the power to investigate offences under Secs A which enables <ORG> to authorise police officer not below the rank of an Inspector of Police by general or special order to investigate the aforementioned offences without the order of the Presidency Magistrate or a Magistrate of the first class and may make an arrest without a warrant A who would by virtue of office be entitled to investigate the aforementioned offences as cognizable offences and could also make arrest without warrant power was conferred on the Presidency Magistrate or the Magistrate of the first class to remove this umbrella of protection by giving an authority to investigate such offences to a police officer of rank lower than the officers of designated rank and the proviso makes a further dent in the safeguard in that <ORG> by general or special order can bring down the designated rank to the level of Inspector of Police to investigate these offences A of Act incorporates such a safeguard in favour of the accused that upon its true interpretation it is not open to the special Judge to take cognizance of an offence except upon a police report that may be submitted by officers of the designated rank or officers authorised by the Presidency Magistrate or the Magistrate of the first class or the Inspector of Police authorised by the State Government by a general or special order and therefore a fortiori it must exclude cognizance being taken by the special Judge upon a private complaint because that would completely render illusory the safeguard prescribed in Sec The State Government may by notification in the official Gazette appoint as many special Judges as may be necessary for such area as areas as may be specified in the notification to try the following offences namely a an offence punishable under Sec provides that Every offence specified in sub section of Sec shall be tried by the special Judge for the area within which it was committed or where there are more special Judges than one for such area by such one of them as may be specified in this behalf by <ORG> a and but also to try offences other than those mentioned therein with which the accused may under the Code of Criminal Procedure be charged at the same trial The special Judge has exclusive jurisdiction to try offences enumerated in Sec Where there are more than one special Judge for the same area <ORG> is under an obligation to specify the local jurisdiction of each special Judge it may be case wise it may be area wise enlarges the jurisdiction to try other offences which have been committed in the course of the same transaction and for which the accused could be charged at the same trial It reads as under A special Judge may take cognizance of offences without the accused being committed to him for trial and in trying the accused persons shall follow the procedure prescribed by the Code of Criminal Procedure for the trial of warrant cases by Magistrates A special Judge may with a view to obtaining the evidence of any person supposed to have been directly or indirectly concerned in or privy to an offence tender a pardon to such person on condition of his making a full and true disclosure of the whole circumstances within his knowledge relating to the offence and to every other person concerned whether as principal or abettor in the commis sion thereof and any pardon so tendered shall for the purposes of Secs Save as provided in sub section or sub section the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure shall so far as they are not consistent with this Act apply to the proceedings before a special Judge and for the purposes of the said provisions <ORG> shall be deemed to be <ORG> trying cases with out a jury or without the aid of assessors and the person conducting a prosecution before a special Judge shall be deemed to be a public prosecutor A In particular and without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in sub section the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure shall so far as may be apply to the proceedings before a special Judge and for the purposes of the said provisions a special Judge shall be deemed to be a Magistrate A special Judge may pass upon any person convicted by him any sentence authorised by law for the punishment of the offence of which such person is convicted This has some relevance to the understanding of some of the decisions bearing on the subject arising from the State of West Bengal provides for the subordination of the special Judge to <ORG> in the matter of appeal revision and other incidental powers which <ORG> exercises over subordinate courts Before we undertake a detailed examination of the submission that Sec which confers power on the special Judge to take cognizance of offences set out in Sec It merely says A special Judge may take cognizance of offences without the accused being committed to him for trial and in trying the accused person shall follow the procedure prescribed by the Code of Criminal Procedure for the trial of warrant cases by Magistrates The court has to take cognizance of the offence before initiation of the proceeding can be contemplated The court called upon to take cognizance of the offence must apply its mind to the facts placed before it either upon a police report or upon a complaint or in some other manner the court came to know about it and in the case of <ORG> upon commitment of the case by the Magistrate The Code made detailed provision for powers of police officers entitled to investigate offences procedure of investigation powers of various courts to take cognizance of offences which that particular court is entitled to try under the Code But then there is another court of original jurisdiction namely <ORG> also being set up under Sec provides that except as otherwise expressly provided by the Code or by any other law for the time being in force no <ORG> shall take cognizance of any offence as a Court of original jurisdiction unless the case has been committed to it by a Magistrate In other words <ORG> can take cognizance of an offence only upon an order of commitment made by the Magistrate and in no other manner This necessitated conferring power on the Magistrate to commit cases to the <ORG> Code of Criminal Procedure makes ample provisions specifying offences which are triable by Magistrate of the first class and Metropolitan Magistrate those triable by a Judicial Magistrate of the second class and those exclusively triable by the <ORG> Column in the First Schedule annexed to the Code of Criminal Procedure specifies which court can try a particular offence under the Indian Penal Code for commitment by the Magistrate of a case brought to him either upon a private complaint or upon a police report provided that the offence is exclusively triable by the <ORG> If the Magistrate took cognizance of an offence upon a complaint which appears to be exclusively triable by <ORG> he has to proceed according to Sections and Chapter XVIII incorporates provisions prescribing procedure for the trial before <ORG> caters to a situation where the case was instituted before the Magistrate on a police report or otherwise In both the cases if it appears to him that the offence which is alleged against the accused is exclusively triable by <ORG> there is no option but to commit the case to <ORG> And any other mode of taking cognizance is specifically barred under Sec All offences under any other law shall be investigated inquired into tried and otherwise dealt with according to the same provisions but subject to any enactment for the time being in force regulating the manner or place of investigating inquiring into trying or otherwise dealing with such offences provides for offences under other law which may be investigated inquired into tried and otherwise dealt with according to the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure but subject to any enactment for the time being in force regulating the manner or place of investigation inquiring into trying or otherwise dealing with such offences In the absence of a specific provision made in the statute indicating that offences will have to be investigated inquired into tried and otherwise dealt with according to that statute the same will have to be investigated inquired into tried and otherwise dealt with according to the Code of Criminal Procedure In other words Code of Criminal Procedure is the parent statute which provides for investigation inquiring into and trial of cases by criminal courts of various designations There is no other known or recognised mode of taking cognizance of an offence by a criminal court Now if <ORG> is a criminal court which atleast was not disputed and jurisdiction is conferred upon the presiding officer of the <ORG> to take cognizance of offences simultaneously excluding one of the four recognised modes of taking cognizance namely upon commitment by a Magistrate as set out in Sec the only other method by which the <ORG> can take cognizance of an offence for the trial of which it was set up is any one of the remaining three other methods known to law by which a criminal court would take cognizance of an offence not as an idle formality but with a view to initiating proceedings and ultimately to try the accused is read in this light and in this background that a special Judge may take cognizance of offence without the accused being committed to him for trial it necessarily implies that the <ORG> is armed with power to take cognizance of offences but that it is denied the power to take cognizance on commitment by the Magistrate This excludes the mode of taking cognizance under Sec which provides various methods of taking cognizance of offences by courts We shall deal with the position of a special Judge a little later It must take cognizance of offences with a view to trying the same but it shall not take it on commitment of the accused to the court As a necessary corollary it must appear that the special Judge can take cognizance of offences enumerated in Sec With regard to the last of the modes of taking cognizance it was urged that there is inherent evidence to show that Sec A little while later we shall point out that the provisions of the <ORG> in such manner and to such extent as to retain the separate identity of the <ORG> and not that he must either fulfil a role of a Magistrate or a Session Court says that the special Judge shall take cognizance of an offence and shall not take it on commitment of the accused It positively conferred power on special Judge to take cognizance of offences and it negatively removed any concept of commitment of the Act on the special Judge to take cognizance of the offences the only exception being not upon a commitment to him that anyone can set the criminal law into motion Let us therefore turn to some of the decisions to which our attention was drawn to substantiate the submission that Sec The limit of the safeguard is that ordinarily investigation of such offences shall be undertaken only by officers of the designated rank save and except with the permission of the Magistrate or as per the first proviso to Sec A of the Act requiring that the investigation into the offences specified therein shall not be conducted by any police officer of a rank lower than a Deputy Superintendent of Police without the specific order of a Magistrate is directory or mandatory The <ORG> rendered the opinion that Sec A is mandatory and not directory and that an investigation conducted in violation thereof bears the stamp of illegality What is the effect of this illegality on the outcome of a concluded trial does not arise for our consideration but there are certain observations which were relied upon to urge that a prior investigation under Sec We must frankly say that we find nothing in this judgment even remotely to bear out the submission In this connection at page the <ORG> has observed as under The underlying policy in making these offences by public servants non cognizable appears to be that public servants who have to discharge their functions often enough in difficult circumstances should not be exposed to the harassment of investigation against them on information levelled possibly by persons affected by their official acts unless a Magistrate is satisfied that an investigation is called for and on such satisfaction authorises the same This is meant to ensure the diligent discharge of their official functions by public servants without fear or favour When therefore the <ORG> thought fit to remove the protection from the public servants in so far as it relates to the investigation of the offences of corruption comprised in the Act by making then cognizable it was considered necessary to provide a substituted safeguard from undue harassment by requiring that the investigation is to be conducted normally by a police officer of a designated higher rank This observation will leave no room for doubt that the safeguard incorporated in Sec a and have been clearly delineated in this judgment when at page it is observed trial follows cognizance and cognizance is preceded by investigation When in the case of a cognizable offence a police officer on receipt of information of an offence proceeds under Chapter XII he starts with investigation and then submits his report called the police report upon which cognizance is taken and then follows the trial And these three stages in that chronology are set out with regard to an investigation by an officer in charge of a police station or a police officer entitled to investigate any particular offence In fact the <ORG> proceeded to make it abundantly clear that a defect or illegality in investigation however serious has no direct bearing on the competence or the procedure relating to cognizance or trial The <ORG> examined the scheme of Secs and to of the Code of Criminal Procedure and observed that the language of Sec These latter sections regulate the competence of the <ORG> and bar its jurisdiction in certain cases excepting in compliance therewith Section does not The <ORG> concluded by observing that where the cognizance of the case has in fact been taken and the case has proceeded to termination the invalidity of the precedent investigation does not vitiate the result unless miscarriage of justice has been caused thereby Having minutely read this judgment on which firm reliance was placed on behalf of the appellant we find nothing in it to come to the conclusion that an investigation under Sec A is a condition precedent before cognizance can be taken of offences triable by special Judge To achieve this object Sections A and introduced the following two safeguards no police officer below the rank of a designated police officer shall investigate any offence punishable under Sec A of the Act without the order of a Presidency Magistrate and no court shall take cognizance of offences hereinabove enumerated except with the previous sanction of the appropriate <ORG> The <ORG> held that these statutory safeguards must be complied with for they were conceived in public interest and were provided as a guarantee against frivolous and vexatious prosecutions The <ORG> further observed that the <ORG> was prepared to believe an officer of an assured status implicity and it prescribed an additional guarantee that in the case of police officers below the rank the previous order of a Presidency Magistrate or a Magistrate of the first class as the case may be Comes thereafter a pertinent observation that the Magistrate status gives assurance to the bonafides of the investigation This would rather show that <ORG> while on the one hand conferred power on the police officers of the designated rank to take upon themselves the investigation of offences committed by public servants it considered intervention of the Magistrate as the real safeguard when investigation was permitted by officers lower in rank then the designated officers this <ORG> held that the order of the Magistrate giving permission to <NAME> to investigate the case did not give any reasons and there was thus a violation of Sec Yet this illegality committed in the course of an investigation does not affect the competence and jurisdiction of the court for trial and where cognizance of the case has in fact been taken and the case has proceeded to termination the invalidity of the preceding investigation does not vitiate the result unless the miscarriage of justice has been caused thereby and in reaching this conclusion reliance was placed on the case of Rishbud In Sirajuddin etc Some guidance is given to the enquiry officer and the means to be adopted in investigation of offences This has no bearing on the issue under discussion A is a safeguard against investigation of offences committed by public servants by petty or lower rank police officer It has nothing to do directly or indirectly with the mode and method of taking cognizance of offences by the court of special Judge It also follows as a necessary corollary that provision of Sec A is not a condition precedent to initiation of proceedings before the special Judge who acquires power under Sec laying down hitherto uncontroverted legal principle that where a statute requires to do a certain thing in a certain way the thing must be done in that way or not at all Other methods of performance are necessarily forbidden A is out of the way in the matter of taking cognizance of offences committed by public servants by a special Judge the power of the special Judge to take cognizance of such offences conferred by Sec One such statutorily recognised well known method of taking cognizance of offences by a court competent to take cognizance is upon receiving a complaint of facts which constitutes the offence says that the special Judge has the power to take cognizance of offences enumerated in Sec a and and the only mode of taking cognizance excluded by the provision is upon commitment It therefore follows that the special Judge can take cognizance of offences committed by public servants upon receiving a complaint of facts constituting such offences It was however submitted that even if it be held that the special Judge is entitled to entertain a private complaint no further steps can be taken by him without directing an investigation under Sec A so that the safeguard of Sec There is no warrant for such an approach Myopic as this is it would topsy turvy the fundamental belief that to a person accused of an offence there is no better safeguard than a court that upon arrest by police the arrested person must be produced before the nearest Magistrate within twenty four hours of the arrest And the very fact that power is conferred on a Presidency Magistrate or Magistrate of the first class to permit police officers of lower rank to investigate these offences would speak for the mind of the <ORG> that the court is a more reliable safeguard than even superior police officers It was urged that there is inherent evidence in other provisions of the Act and the Code of Criminal Procedure which would buttress the submission that the special Judge cannot take cognizance upon a private complaint confers specific powers of taking cognizance of offences without the necessity of the accused being committed for trial and prescribes the procedure for trial of warrant cases by Magistrates to be adopted by a special Judge it is necessary to determine with accuracy whether a special Judge is a Magistrate or a Sessions Judge the provisions of the Code of Criminal procedure shall so far as they are not inconsistent with the Act apply to the proceedings before a special Judge and for the purposes of the said provisions the Court of a special Judge shall be deemed to be <ORG> trying cases without a jury or without the aid of assessors and the person conducting a prosecution before a special Judge shall be deemed to be a public prosecutor it was urged that for the purpose of procedure to be followed by a special Judge in the trial of the case before him he is a Magistrate as provided in Sec but not a Sessions Judge because <ORG> can take cognizance of offences without commitment while a special Judge has to take cognizance of offences without accused being committed to him for trial yet the provisions of sub Secs Proceeding along it was urged that if a special Judge has all the trappings of <ORG> he cannot take cognizance as provided by Sec because it confers power on Magistrate to take cognizance of any offence in any one of the three modes therein prescribed which confers power of taking cognizance does not show any preference The Prevention of Corruption Act was enacted for more effective prevention of bribery and corruption Years rolled by and experience gathered showed that unless a special forum for the trial of such offences as enumerated in the Act is created the object underlying the Act would remain a distant dream This led to the enactment of the Criminal Law Amendment Act The Statement of objects and Reasons accompanying the Bill refers to the recommendations of the <ORG> chaired by Dr <NAME> appointed to review the working of <ORG> and to make recommendations for improvement of laws relating to bribery and corruption To take the cases of corruption out of the maze of cases handled by Magistrates it was decided to set up special courts conferred power on the State Government to appoint as many special Judges as may be necessary with power to try the offences set out in clauses a and of the Code of Criminal Procedure which provides for constitution of criminal courts it would become clear that a new court with a new designation was being set up and that it has to be under the administrative and judicial superintendence of the High <ORG> As already pointed out there were four types of criminal courts functioning under the High <ORG> Now when a new court which is indisputably a criminal court because it was not even whispered that the <ORG> of special Judge is not a criminal court is set up to make it effective and functionally oriented it becomes necessary to prescribe its powers procedure status and all ancillary provisions While setting up a court of a special Judge keeping in view the fact that the high dignitaries in public life are likely to be tried by such a court the qualification prescribed was that the person to be appointed as special Judge has to be either a Sessions Judge Additional Sessions Judge or Assistant Sessions Judge After prescribing the qualification the <ORG> proceeded to confer power upon a special Judge to take cognizance of offences for the trial of which a special court with exclusive jurisdiction was being set up Now the Code prescribes different procedures for trial of cases by different courts Procedure for trial of a case before a <ORG> of Sessions is set out in Chapter XVIII trial of warrant cases by Magistrates is set out in Chapter XIX and the provisions therein included catered to both the types of cases coming before the Magistrate namely upon police report or otherwise than on a police report Chapter XX prescribes the procedure for trial of summons cases by Magistrates and Chapter XXI prescribes the procedure for summary trial Now that a new criminal court was being set up the <ORG> took the first step of providing its comparative position in the hierarchy of courts under Sec by bringing it on level more or less comparable to the <ORG> of Sessions but in order to avoid any confusion arising out of comparison by level it was made explicit in Sec itself that it is not a <ORG> of Sessions because it can take cognizance of offences without commitment as contemplated by Sec <ORG> shall be deemed to be <ORG> trying cases without a jury or without the aid of assessors The <ORG> then proceeded to specify which out of the various procedures set out in the Code this new court shall follow for trial of offences before it A glance through the provisions will show that the provisions therein included catered to both the situations namely trial of a case initiated upon police report Sec A and trial of cases instituted otherwise than on police report Sec to If a special Judge is enjoined with a duty to try cases according to the procedure prescribed in foregoing provisions he will have to first decide whether the case was instituted upon a police report or otherwise than on police report and follow the procedure in the relevant group of sections This is what is called legislation by the incorporation Similarly whether the question of taking congnizane arises it is futile to go in search of question of taking congnizance arises it is futile to go in search of the Magistrate to take cognizance of the offence special Judge is a Magistrate What is to be done is that one has to read the expression special Judge in place of Magistrate and the whole thing becomes crystal clear The <ORG> wherever it found the grey area clarified it by making specific provision such as the one in sub of Sec and to leave no one in doubt further provided in sub that all the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure shall so far as they are not inconsistent with the Act apply to the proceedings before a special Judge It did not envisage any Court of a special Judge and the <ORG> never wanted to draw up an exhaustive Code of Procedure for this new criminal court which was being set up Therefore it conferred power taking cognizance of offences prescribed procedure trial of warrant cases by a Magistrate indicated authority to tender pardon Sec and then after declaring is status as comparable to <ORG> proceeded to pres cribe that all provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure will apply in so far as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of the Act The net outcome of this position is that a new court of original jurisdiction was set up and whenever a question arose as to what are its powers in respect of specific questions brought before it as court of original criminal jurisdiction it had to refer to the Code of Criminal Procedure undaunted by any designation claptrap The entire argument inviting us to specifically decide whether a court of a special Judge for a certain purpose is <ORG> or <ORG> revolves round a mistaken belief that a special Judge has to be one or the other and must fit in the slot of a Magistrate or <ORG> Such an approach would strangulate the functioning of the court and must be eschewed As a court of original criminal jurisdiction in order to make it functionally oriented some powers were conferred by the statute setting up the court Except those specifically conferred and specifically denied it has to function as a court of original criminal jurisdiction not being hide bound by the terminological status description of Magistrate or <ORG> Under the Code it will enjoy all powers which a court of original criminal jurisdiction enjoys save and except the ones specifically denied Once court of a special Judge is a court of original criminal jurisdiction it became necessary to provide whether it is subordinate to <ORG> whether appeal and revision against its judgments and orders would lie to <ORG> and whether <ORG> would have general superintendence over a Court of special Judge as it has over all criminal courts as enumerated in Sec confers on <ORG> all the powers conferred by Chapters XXXI and XXXIII of the Code of Criminal Procedure on <ORG> as if the court of special Judge were a court of <NAME> trying cases without a jury within the local limits of the jurisdiction of <ORG> The court has to be treated as a court of original criminal jurisdiction and shall have all the powers as any court of original criminal jurisdiction has under the Code of Criminal Procedure except those specifically excluded Once the position and power of <ORG> a special Judge in the hierarchy of criminal courts under <ORG> is clearly and unambiguously established it is unnecessary to roam into an enquiry examining large number of decisions laying down in the context of each case that <ORG> a special Judge is <ORG> and the contrary view taken in some other decisions It was submitted that there is further internal evidence pointing in the direction that a private complaint cannot be entertained by a special Judge in Chapter XVIII containing provisions prescribing procedure of trial before <ORG> provides that in every trial before <ORG> the prosecution shall be conducted by a Public Prosecutor of the Act provides that the person conducting a prosecution before a special Judge shall be deemed to be a public prosecutor It was urged that public prosecutions are ordinarily launched in the name of the <ORG> because in matters of serious offences the society is interested in punishing the anti social elements who may be a menace to society and that such prosecution is not for satisfying private lust or sense of vengeance His duty is to fairly analyse the evidence for and against the accused and that he should not withheld any evidence which has a bearing on the issues before the court is confined to the limits of its requirement in that the person conducting a prosecution before a special Judge is to be deemed to be a public prosecutor that a prosecution before a special Judge shall be conducted by a public prosecutor On the contrary conscious of the position that a private complaint may be filed before a special Judge who may take cognizance of the offences on such a complaint the <ORG> wanted to clothe the person in charge of the prosecution before a special Judge with the status of a public prosecutor for the purposes of the Code of Criminal Procedure It was then submitted that if the object underlying Act was to provide for a more speedy trial of offences of corruption by a public servant this laudable object would be thwarted if it is ever held that a private complaint can be entertained by a special Judge The Judge thereafter ordinarily will have to postpone issue of process against the accused and either inquire into the case himself or direct an investigation to be made by a police officer and in cases under the Act by police officers of designated rank for the purpose of deciding whether or not there is sufficient ground for proceeding If the Judge proceeds to hold the inquiry himself he is obliged to take evidence on oath but it was said that if <ORG> is <ORG> the case would be governed by proviso to sub of Sec This would certainly thwart a speedy trial was the apprehension disclosed and therefore it was said that there is internal contra indication that a private complaint is not maintainable We find no merit in the submissions As has been distinctly made clear that <ORG> is a court of original criminal jurisdiction and that it can take cognizance of an offence in the manner hereinbefore indicated it may be that in order to test whether the complaint disclosed a serious offence or that there is any frivolity involved in it the Judge may insist upon holding an inquiry by postponing the issue of process After examining the complainant on oath and examining the witnesses present if any meaning thereby that the witnesses not present need not be examined it would open to the court to judicially determine whether a case is made out for issuing process When it is said that court issues process it means the court has taken cognizance of the offence and has decided to initiate the proceeding and as a visible manifestation of taking cognizance process is issued which means that the accused is called upon to appear before the court The other option open to the court is to direct investigation to be made by a police officer A But it must be made distinctly clear that it is neither obligatory to hold the inquiry before issuing process to direct the investigation of the offence by police Viewed from either angle there is no merit in this submission There is no commitment and therefore Sec The power to take cognizance without holding inquiry or directing investigation is implicit in Sec when it says that the Magistrate may if he thinks fit postpone the issue of process against the accused and either inquire into the case himself or direct an investigation to be made by a police officer for the purpose of deciding whether or not there is sufficient ground for proceeding Therefore the matter is left to the judicial discretion of the court whether on examining the complainant and the witnesses if any as contemplated by Sec Therefore there is no merit in the contention that by entertaining a private complaint the purpose of speedy trial would be towarted or that a pre process safeguard would be denied Further when cognizance is taken on a private complaint or to be precise otherwise than on a police report the special Judge has to try the case according to the procedure prescribed for trial of warrant cases instituted otherwise than on police report by a Magistrate Sec requires that when accused is brought before a court the court shall proceed to hear the complainant and take all such evidence as may be produced in support of the prosecution Accused has a right to cross examine complainant and his witnesses If upon considering the evidence so produced the court finds that no case against the accused has been made out which if undebutted would warrant his conviction the court shall discharge the accused Sec If on the other hand the court is of the opinion that there is ground for presuming that the accused has committed an offence which the court is competent to try a charge shall be framed in writing against the accused Sec Prosecution may examine additional witnesses whom the accused would be entitled to cross examine of the Act modification was considered necessary in sub of Sec A which prescribed procedure for trial of warrant cases instituted upon a police report while no corresponding amendment was made in any of the provisions contained in the same Chapter which prescribed procedure for warrant cases instituted otherwise than on police report and that this wold show that a private complainant which will be required to be tried according to the procedure prescribed for trial of warrant cases instituted otherwise than on a police report was not within the contemplation of the <ORG> It is to the effect that instead of the words the accused shall then be called upon the words the accused shall then be required to give in writing at once or within such time as the Magistrate may allow a list of persons if any whom he proposes to examined as his witnesses and all the documents if any on which he proposes to rely and he shall then be called upon to enter his defence shall be substituted of the Code of Criminal Procedure and that this glaring omission would clearly indicate that the procedure prescribed for trial of warrant cases otherwise than on police report was not within the contemplation for the trial of offences under the Act Prior thereto there was uniform procedure for trial of warrant cases by Magistrate irrespective of whether the case was instituted on a police report or otherwise than on a police report A in respect of cases instituted on a police report and ii Sec It should not be forgotten that prior to the procedure for trial of warrant cases instituted on a police report and otherwise than on police report was the same and the Act of set up <ORG> to try cases under the Act and the trial was to be held according to the procedure prescribed for trial of warrant case It necessarily follows that between to <ORG> would have followed the same procedure for trial of a case instituted upon a police report or otherwise than on a police report The learned Judges composing <ORG> of <ORG> by their separate judgments negatived the contention of the appellant holding that for the purpose of taking cognizance of an offence under the Act special Judge was a Magistrate and can take cognizance as provided by Sec of the Code of Criminal Procedure There is the third decision in this context which may be briefly referred to here This was treated as so obvious by the court that there is no discussion in support of the conclusion Having examined the matter from all the different angles we are satisfied that the conclusion reached both by the learned special Judge and <ORG> of <ORG> that a private complaint filed by the complainant was clearly maintainable and that the cognizance was properly taken is correct
