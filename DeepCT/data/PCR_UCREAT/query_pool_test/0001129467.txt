These appeals are preferred against the judgment of <ORG> of the Madhya Pradesh <ORG> allowing the Letters Patent Appeal preferred by the State of Madhya Pradesh against the judgment of a learned Single Judge who had allowed the writ petition filed by the appellant While we agree fully with the reasoning and conclusion of <ORG> we think it necessary at the same time to emphasise a few aspects relevant in the case of such contracts After making the necessary deposits and after complying with other conditions licences were granted to him and he commenced the business with effect from Thereupon a notice dated exhibit was issued by the authorities intimating him that he was in arrears of the licence fee for the months of July and August and that if he does not pay the same the shops would be reauctioned Though the appellant received the said notice he did not appear before the specified authority He thus filed to avail of the opportunity of personal hearing afforded to him We accept the said finding On a notification was issued communicated to a large number of excise officers and other departments and a copy of which was also sent to the appellant stating that if the appellant did not clear the arrears on or before the shops would be sold by reauction to be held at on It was also published in the daily newspaper <ORG> The notification mentioned the precise amount of arrears due from the appellant and stated that on the reauction being held the existing licence in favour of the appellant shall stand cancelled We may set out sub section of Section this stage Where a licence is cancelled or suspended under Clause a clause clause or clause of sub section a the fee payable for the balance of the period for which such licence would have been current but for such cancellation or suspension may be recovered from the ex licensee as excise revenue the Collector may take the grant under management or resell it at the risk and loss of the ex licensee but any profit realised by such management or resale which is not in excess of the amount recovered under clause a for such period shall be paid to the ex licensee He submitted that he was not given due opportunity before cancelling the licence as required by sub section A of Section that there was no order of cancellation of licence as such and that there was no proper publicity for the reauction conducted He submitted that on account of lack of due publicity only one bidder was present at the reauction and that the shops were sold at a low price Before we set out the reasoning of <ORG> it would be appropriate to set out sub section A of Section It reads A Before making an order cancelling ok suspending a licence permit or pass under sub section the authority aforesaid shall record in writing the reasons for the proposed action furnish to the holder thereof a brief statement of the same and afford him a reasonable opportunity of being heard <ORG> held that as held by that <ORG> in an earlier decision the court cannot take a hypertechnical view of the provisions and must understand the same in a reasonable manner After referring to the contents of exhibit the Bench held that the said notification was both an order of cancellation of the appellant licence as well as notice of reauction It also found that there was adequate publicity of the said notification and the fact that only one bidder appeared at the reauction was no ground for holding that there was no proper publicity It gave reasons why bidder generally do not attend reauctions <ORG> also found as a fact that the appellant failed to appear on the date of hearing specified in notice A mandatory provision conceived in the interest of a party can be waived by that party whereas a mandatory provision conceived in the interest of public cannot be waived by him If it is not conceived in the interest of public question of waiver and or acquiescence may arise subject of course to the pleadings of the parties Though the said decisions were rendered with reference to the statutory Rules and statutory provisions besides the principles of natural justice governing the disciplinary enquiries involving government servants and employees of statutory corporation the principles adumbrated therein are of general application There is yet another fact The contract provides for payment of monthly rental on or before a particular date If the amount of monthly rental not paid before the due date the licence is liable to be cancelled as provided by sub section of Section It is a case of a contract stipulating monthly payments If there is a default in paying a month rental notice proposing cancellation may follow The time given to the licencee to show cause would naturally be a short one for the reason that soon thereafter the next month rental licence fee falls due and if that is not paid another show cause notice may have to follow It must be remembered that in this case the default was for two consecutive months July and August But when he defaulted for the next month also they issued the notice proposing cancellation The considerations aforementioned should be kept in mind while examining complaints of violation of statutory Rules conditions add terms of contract as well as complaints of jack of reasonable opportunity
