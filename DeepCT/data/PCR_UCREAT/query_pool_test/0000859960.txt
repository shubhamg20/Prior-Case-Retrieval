The lorry bearing registration No MDJ owned by the st respondent is the vehicle which was involved in the accident The two respondents contested the petition and the <ORG> came to the conclusion that the accident was not due to any negligence or rashness on the part of the dirver of the lorry that it was an inevitable accident due to an unforeseen mechanical defect and that therefore the claimants are not entitled to any compensation The <ORG> also gave a finding that if the claimants are entitled to compensation on the ground that the accident was a result of rash or negligent driving of the vehicle a sum of Rs But the petition came to be dismissed on the abound that there was no rashness or negligence on the part of the driver of the lorry The first question that arises for consideration is whether the accident was as a result of negligence There is a tea shop called Gopal Tea Stall east of the pavement We have also the evidence of <NAME> the police officer who visited the scene sometime after the accident and he has drawn a plan as per Exhibit showing the tyre marks and other particulars <NAME> the driver of the lorry stated that he was driving the lorry from north to south that the lorry was empty i without any load that two bullock carts were going ahead of the lorry that he overtook the said two bullock carts by going to his right side western side of the road that after he so overtook the two carts he wanted to bring the lorry to the centre of the road that then the steering began to wobble that the steering wheel turned left and could not be brought to the normal position that when he applied the brakes they failed and that therefore the vehicle got over the platform on the eastern side of the road and dashed against the tea shop only after which the vehicle came to a stop There are two aspects of the question He should further show that he took reasonable care to avoid such mechanical defect There is no evidence as to whether the sub axle nuts broke or slipped <NAME> in Motor Claims Cases th Edition page points out that if an accident is due to a latent defect which is not discoverable by reasonable care there is no negligence In the case of mechanical break down unless the defendant satisfies the <ORG> that he arranged periodical check up and carried out necessary repanis regularly and that he did everything in his power to eliminate mechanical unsoundness the break down would be only a neutral factor and not a valid deferce In the present case there is absolutely no evidence to show that the st respondent took any care to avoid the mechanical defect Therefore I think the st respondent has not discharged his burden of rebutting the presumption arising from the doctrine of res The next point to be considered is whether the appellants who are the brothers and sister of <NAME> since deceased are persons entitled to claim compensation under Section A of the Motor Vehicles Act hereinafter referred to as the Act Per contra the contention on behalf of the appellants is that the provisions of the Fatal Accidents Act have no application to claim before <ORG> that the provisions under the Motor Vehicles Act give a right to all legal representatives of the deceased to maintain to claim for compensatior that the term legal representatives occurring in section A of the Act would take in the brothers and sister of a deceased who died a bachelor and that therefore their claim cannot be negatived on the ground that they are not dependants as defired under Section A of the Fatal Accidents Act Even in respect of claims before <ORG> one has necessarily to look to the provisions of the Fatal Accidents Act because the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act do not create substantive rights but they any only procedural in character Though they are not entitled to compensation for loss of benefit as they are not dependants under Section A of the Fatal Accidents Act they would be entitled to claim compensation towards loss of estate of the deceased as persons who represent his estate The contention on behalf of the appellants proceed on the footing that Sections to of the Act create substantive rights and that they are not merely procedural law under which persons can claim compensation for either death or injury caused by tortious acts Undoubtedly the substantive right to claim compensation is only under the general law of torts It cannot be disputed and as a matter of fact it is not disputed that either an injured or the legal representatives of the deceased as the case may be should establish that the accident was as a result of rashness or negligence on the part of the owner of the motor vehicle or his servant before ever they can claim compensation in espect of the accident That being so merely because Section A says that either the injured person or the legal representatives of the deceased as the case may be can file application for compensation and Section says that <ORG> may make an award determining the amount of compensation which appears to be just it cannot be claimed that any new right is created under these provisions The <ORG> making an award determining the amount of compensation which appears to it to be just has naturally to look to the law of torts in determining such compensation If the owner of the vehicle is not a tort feaser then in spite of the accident causing either injury or death as the case may be no compensation can be awarded by the <ORG> Therefore the mere fact that the section says that the <ORG> would determine the amount of compensation which appears to it to be just does not mean that any new right is created to the claimants It is stated that in the latest amendment of the Act Section has been so amended in order to create an absolute liability in respect of injuries caused to passengers in public service vehicles Section as it originally stood stated that the insurance must be a policy which insures the person or classes of persons specified in the policy to the extent specified in Sub section against any liability which may be incurred by him or them in respect of the death of or bodily injury to any person caused by or arising out of the use of the vehicle in a public place There is also a proviso to this Clause but that need not be referred to now In order to comply with the requirements of this Chapter a policy of insurance must be a policy which a insures the person or classes of persons specified in the policy to the extent specified in Sub section i against any liability which may be incurred by him in respect of the death of or bodily injury to any person or damage to any property of a third party caused by or arising out of the use of the vehicle in a public place ii against the death of or bodily injury to any passenger of a public service vehicle caused by or arising out of the use of the vehicle in a public place As in the new Clause i it is stated that the insurance is to he against any liability which may be incurred by the person or classes of persons specified in the policy but Clause ii simply says that the insurance is to be against the death of or bodily injury to any passenger of a public service vehicle without referring to any liability which may be incurred by the person or classes of persons insured in respect of such death of or bodily injury to any passenger it is said that under the abovesaid clause viz In paragraph of the said objects and reasons it is stated that the bill seeks to provide for covering of passenger risks for public service vehicles irrespective of the culpability of the owner or driver of such vehicle for any accident in which it may be involved provided that there was no contributory negligence on the part of the victim Though the statement of objects and reasons mentioned above supports the above view whether the said object has been achieved or not has to he examined Assuming without deciding that the new Section creates an absolute liability in respect of injury or death to passengers in a public service vehicle that has nothing to do with the present question for two grounds viz this amendment comes into effect only in the year and the absolute liability if any is only in respect of passengers in a public service vehicle If really the present Section creates an absolute liability in respect of passengers in a public service vehicle that fact would only highlight the position that in respect of other claimants there is no question of absolute liability and that the claimants can succeed only by proving that the injury or the death as the case may be was due to tortious act on the part of the owner of the motor vehicle either directly or vicariously If one has necessarily to look to the law of torts then it must be remembered that before the coining into force of the Legal Representatives Suits Act XII of and the Indian Fatal Accidents Act XIII of under the maxim of actio personalis moritur cum persona no action could be maintained by any one in respect of the death of a person even though the death bad been caused by the defendant by committing a tortious act The result was that the person who caused the death of other cannot be sued in tort though if death had not been caused but only injury had been caused the injured would be entitled to sue and recover damages for the tortious act Under Section A of the Fatal Accidents Act a new right is created in favour of certain defendants who are named therein to maintain an action or suit for damages in respect of the death of a person Under the Legal Representatives Suits Art XII of which corresponds to the Law Reforms Act in England the cause of action in respect of loss to the estate of a person whose death had been caused by tortious act is made to survive and be available to the executors administrators or representatives of the deceased If the person wronged does not die as a result of the wrong doing under the general law of torts he always has the right to maintain an action for loss of estate I will come to the question what exactly is the loss of estate a little later That is the first part of section a of the said Act which says Provided always that not more than one action or suit shall be brought for and in respect of the same subject matter of complaint If a person dies of a tortious act there could not be one action for the loss of benefit to one of the dependants as contemplated under Section A of the said Act and a separate action for loss of such benefit to another dependent though a separate suit or action for the loss of estate can be brought by the executors or administrators or representatives of the deceased as the case may be The second part of Section of the Fatal Accidents Act says Provided that in any such action or suit the executor administrator or representative of the deceased may insert a claim for and recover any pecuniary loss to the estate of the deceased occasioned by such wrongful act neglect or default which sum when recovered shall be deemed part of the assets of the estate of the deceased It may he seen that this provision contained in Section of the Fatal Accidents Act itself is procedural in character as it does not create any substantive right in the executor administrator or representative of the deceased to claim pecuniary loss to the estate of the deceased But as the law originally stood such right to claim pecuniary loss to the estate would have died with the deceased and no action could be maintained by the deceased executor administrator or representative Section of the Fatal Accidents Act only says that the executor administrator or representative of the deceased may insert a claim for pecuniary loss to the estate of the deceased in a suit or action brought on behalf of the dependants of the deceased for less of benefit as contemplated under Section A Thus it is dear that Section of the Fatal Accidents Act itself does not create any right but it is only an enabling provision saying that if there is an action or suit for loss of benefit to the dependants the executor administrator or representative of the deceased may insert a claim for pecuriary loss to the estate of the deceased in the same action But the exception is in respect of personal injuries causing the death of the patty In case of personal injuries causing the death of the party the cause of action does survive to the executors or administrators of the deceased But for that Act under the maxim actio personalis moritur cum persona the cause of action even in respect of injuries causing the death of the person would die with him There is no distinction between a motor accident causing fatal injuries to a person and other accidents or any other act causing such fatal injuries regarding rights and liabilities of the parties The liability of the defendant in all such cases including cases of motor accidents is founded only on the law of torts Under Section of the Motor Vehicles Act as it stood before the amendment of the year the State Governments had been empowered to appoint persons to investigate and report on motor accidents The present provisions contained in Sections to came into effect on February It is stated that the original provision had not helped persons of limited means in preferring claims on account of injury or death because a <ORG> decree has to be obtained before the obligation of an insurance company to meet the claims can be enforced and it is therefore proposed to empower State Governments to appoint <ORG> to determine and award damages There can be no doubt therefore that the provisions cortained in Sections to of the Motor Vehicles Act which speak of the constitution of <ORG> and how applications to such Tribunals should be made and disposed of relate only to procedure and they have nothing to do with the substantive rights and liabilities of parties It is needless to stress that the substantive right of a claimant and the liability of the defendant have to be determined only as per the law of torts and that but for the Legal Representatives Suits Act and the Fatal Accidents Act both of the year there would be no cause of action available to any ore in respect of injuries resulting in the death of the injured Till the recent amendment of the Act by Act LVI of section stated that <ORG> is to be constituted for the purpose of adjudicating upon claims for compensation in respect of accidents involving the death of or bodily injury to persons arising out of the use of motor vehicles If a person goes on a cycle and he is knocked down by a motor car due to the negligence or rashness on the part of the motor car driver then the person who is so knocked down would be entitled to claim the value of the damaged cycle apart from other damages Section no of the Act as it stood before the recent amendment of did not specifically provide for <ORG> going into the question such damages to property the question arose whether the civil Court has no jurisdiction to entertain even a claim in respect of damage to property in a motor accident He filed a suit in the civil Court for damages towards his personal injuries as well as damages to the cycle As <ORG> had been constituted the civil Court returned the plaint holding that it had no jurisdiction to entertain any part of the claim On a revision against such an order <NAME> as he then was held that in so far as the claim in respect of personal injuries is concerned Sections and of the Motor Vehicles Act make it clear that the claim for bodily injury is triable only by <ORG> having territorial jurisdiction but the jurisdiction of such <ORG> is limited by the terms of the statute and did not cover claims of damages to property and that therefore the civil Court had jurisdiction to try the suit in so far as that relates to the claim of compensation for demage to the property Section no before the recent amendment read as follows A State Government may by notification in the Official Gazette constitute one or more Motor Accidents Claims Tribunals hereinafter referred to as Claims Tribunals for such area as may be specified in the notification for the purpose of adjudicating upon claims for compensation in respect of accidents involving the death of or bodily injury to persons arising out of the use of motor vehicles The words motor vehicles occurring in the above sub section have now been substituted with other words and a proviso has also been added and Section as amended reads as follows A State Government may by notification in the Official Gazette constitute one or more Motor Accidents Claims Tribunals hereinafter referred to as Claims Tribunals for such area as may be specified in the notification for the purpose of adjudicating upon claims for compensation in respect of accidents involving the death of or bodily injury to persons arising out of the use of motor vehicles or damage to any property of a third party so arising or both Provided that where such claim includes a claim for compensation in respect of damage to property exceeding rupees two thousand the claimant may at his option refer the claim to a civil <ORG> for adjudication and where a reference is so made <ORG> shall have no jurisdiction to enertain any question relating to such claim the civil <ORG> and <ORG> would have concurrent jurisdiction as it were and the claimant in such a case would have the option to choose the forum Therefore there can be no doubt that Sections to prescribe only a special forum in the place of the civil <ORG> in respect of claims relating to motor accidents and those sections have nothing to do with the substantive rights and liabilities of parties Before dealing with the case law on the point I would like to dispose of another aspect The said rules are purported to be made under Section of the Act But Section does not really give power to <ORG> to make any rules It is Section A that gives power to <ORG> to make rules for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of Sections to I take it that the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunals Rules are made under the above provision viz Rule of the said rules says Legal representative shall have the meaning assigned to it under Clause of Section of the Code of Civil Procedure It takes in not only administrators executors and heirs but all other persons who represent the estate of the deceased The definition says that the terms include even persons who intermeddle with the estate of the deceased Even so this definition would not take in all the persons who would be entitled to file claim as per the provisions contained in the Fatal Accidents Act and the Legal Representatives Suits Act Under the Legal Representatives Suits Act an action can be maintained by an executor administrator or representative of the deceased person in respect of pecuniary loss to the estate the claim for loss of benefit as well as that for loss of the estate can be brought not only by an executor or administrator but also by a representative of the deceased As already pointed out if there is a claim for loss of benefit to the dependants mentioned in Section A of the Fatal Accidents Act a claim for loss to the estate the cause of action for which claim is preserved by the Legal Representatives Suits Act can be inserted in the same claim I am also of the opinion that the term legal representative occurring in Section A of the Act takes in persons covered by the term representative occurring in Section A of the Fatal Accidents Act But in my opinion the term representative occurring in Section A of the Fatal Accidents Act has different connotations and the term takes in even persons who do not represent the estate of the deceased Aiyar Law Lexicon it is stated that the ordinary legal sense of the terra representatives without the addition of legal or personal is executors and administrators but contextually representatives may be taken to mean as next of kin or the descendants Therefore it is clear that the term representative or legal representative should ordinarily denote a person who represents the estate of the deceased but the said terms may denote even next of kin if the context warrants it We are of the opinion that the term representative occurring in Section A of the Fatal Accidents Act means next of kin and not merely heirs or persons who represent the estate of the deceased The claim made on behalf of them need not be as representative of the estate of the deceased The father of the deceased as well as the grandfather of the deceased is a dependant entitled to claim compensation or less of benefit though of course there must be proof that but for the death of the deceased he would have been receiving some benefit from him and the quantum of compensation has to be determined in favour of each dependant separately according to the nature and extent of dependency But such father or grandfather may not be an heir if the deceased has left a widow or mother or child and the parties are Hindus and he may not also be a person representing the estate of the deceased as contemplated under Section of the Code of Civil Procedure Though it is clear that for a person to be one representing the estate of the deceased he need not necessarily be an administrator executor or heir still he must have something to do with the estate of the deceased Therefore if the father or grandfather who is not an heir has no possession of any part of the estate of the deceased and he has nothing to do with such estate he may not be a person representing the estate of the deceased in any sense of the term That means if the term representative occurring in Section A of the Fatal Accidents Act is understood as a person representing the estate of the deceased a father or grandfather of the deceased may not be in a position to bring an action in his own name for loss of benefit That being so the term representative occurring in that Act should refer to persons who represent the estate of the deceased and that need not take in next of kin who would be dependants of the deceased under the Fatal Accidents Act but may not be persons who represent the estate of the deceased Therefore the word representative occurring in Section A and the same term occurring in the Legal Representatives Suits Act need not have the same meaning In fact the term representative occurring in Section of the Fatal Accidents Act has to be understood only in the same way as in the Legal Representatives Suits Act i as a person representing the estate of the deceased for that section speaks of claim relating to the pecuniary loss to the estate of the deceased The above conclusion of mine would mean that the term representative occurring in different sections of the Fatal Accidents Act would have different meanings While under Section A the term representative should refer to next of kin who are dependants in Section the same term has to refer to persons representing the estate of the deceased But when the term has to be understood according to context we do not see any difficulty in placing such construction on the term which differs from one section to another Sections to of the Act being only procedural in character and having nothing to do with the substantive rights and liabilities of parties do not make any reference to either loss of benefit or loss to the estate as heads on which compensation can be claimed in the case of a person whose death was caused by a motor accident Only compensation for loss to the estate of the deceased the cause of action for which is preserved by the Legal Representatives Suits Act and loss of benefit to the dependants which right has been created by Section A of the Fatal Accidents Act can be claimed in case of death of a person in any accident including a motor accident It is in the above context one has to see the sense in which the term legal representative is used in Section A of the Act The term legal representative therefore should necessarily include not only persons who represent the estate of the deceased who can claim loss to the estate of the deceased and the next of kin who are mentioned as dependants under Section A of the Fatal Accidents Act who can claim compensation for loss of benefit to themselves whether they represent the estate of the deceased or not In other words it should take in all persons who can maintain an action under the Legal Representatives Suits Act or under Section of the Fatal Accidents Act as the case may be as well as those who can maintain an action under Section A of the Fatal Accidents Act that the term legal representative as defined in the Code of Civil Procedure is not limited to administrators executors and heirs but includes any person who in law represents the estate of the deceased <ORG> points out that as per Section of the present Code of Civil Procedure a person who in law represents the estate of a deceased person must include different legatees under the will and that there is no justification for holding that the estate in the context must mean the whole of the estate Even so as I already pointed out a legal representative as contemplated under Section of the Code of the Civil Procedure should necessarily represent the estate of the deceased A person who is a dependant under Section A of the Fatal Accidents Act need not necessarily be one who represents the estate of the deceased First of all Section A of the Act gives power to <ORG> to make rules only for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of Sections to The attempted definition under Rule is not necessary for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of Sections to of the Act Further as I already pointed out if the term legal representative occurring in Section A is to have the same meaning as in Section of the Code of Civil Procedure then the rights of some of the dependents under Section A of the Fatal Accidents Act who may not be persons representing the estate of the deceased would be affected and they would be out of Court This contention if I may say so with respect was rightly rejected by the Bench of <ORG> As I already pointed out under Section of the Code of Civil Procedure unless a person represents the estate of the deceased he cannot be called a legal representative and some of the dependants under Section A of the Fatal Accidents Act need not necessarily be persons who represent the estate of the deceased With respect I agree with the above observation One of the contentions raised on behalf of the appellants is that as Section of the Act speaks of the <ORG> making an award determining the amount of compensation which appears to it to be just the powers of the <ORG> are independent of the provisions of the Fatal Accidents Act as well as that under the Legal Representatives Suits Act and that therefore the provisions of the Act must be construed as substantive provisions and not merely procedural in character If it is a claim by an injured person he can certainly claim compensation for the pain suffering etc loss of earning other pecuniary loss arising out of the injury and shortening of expectation of life if any provided the injury or injuries had been caused by a tortious act by the owner of the vehicle by himself or vicariously So even though the Claims <ORG> is given power to determine the amount of compensation which appears to be just it has necessarily to look to the law of torts in determining such just compensation Similarly in case of death due to injuries just compensation awardable by the <ORG> should naturally be only towards loss of benefit if any and loss of estate if any provided again that the death was caused by a tortious act I think I have said enough to show that Sections to of the Act are only procedural in character and for substantive rights and liabilities of the parties one has necessarily to look to the law of torts read with the Legal Representatives Suits Act and the Fatal Accidents Act In the recent amendment i under amending Act LVI of some new sections have been added one of which section CC gives power to <ORG> to award simple interest on the amount awarded from the date of the claim application It cannot be said that that creates any new right and thereby the provisions in the Act become substantive law and not merely procedural in character for even the civil <ORG> is not incompetent to award such interest Now I turn to the case law on the point whether Sections to are only procedural in character or not The Division Bench observed at page As we pointed out section provides a speeder remedy obviously conceived as a better one from the point of view of the injured person or his unfortunate dependants No new right or even a new remedy has beer created by that provisions the forum alone is changed The right to claim damages by the legal representatives of a deceased in respect of an accident where the latter met with his death was actionable under the pre existing law in civil <ORG> The aggrieved person has as before a remedy for damages in respect of the injury The period of limitation has also been curtailed but these two are matters of procedure Then at page the Division Bench held that as the above provisions in the Act relate only to procedure the law prevailing at the time of the institution of the action alone will govern such matters The conclusion was that even in respect of accidents which occurred prior to the constitution of the <ORG> only the <ORG> will have exclusive jurisdiction and the jurisdiction of the civil <ORG> is ousted With respect I agree with the view expressed by the above Bench which was referred to earlier in some other connection <ORG> has followed the above decision of this Court and held that Sections to of the Act only provide a more expeditious remedy and that they do not create any new rights <ORG> has taken the same view a similar view has been taken and it has been held that Sections to merely deal with the subject of the substitution of <ORG> in place of civil Courts for the purpose of adjudicating on claims for compensation and they do not deal with the question of substantive rights and liabilities of parties Court has also taken a similar view in two cases viz <ORG> has also taken a similar view The sister of a deceased person is no doubt not a dependant as contemplated under Section A of the Fatal Accidents Act but still if she represented the estate of the deceased she could certainly maintain an action for claim on the ground of loss to the estate of the deceased Therefore there is nothing wrong in awarding compensation to her towards the death of her brother The only point was whether the claim could be advanced by the married sister of the deceased who died as bachelor This conclusion does not go counter to the view expressed by us and in <NAME> <ORG> A <NAME> But the learned Judges <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> in the course of their order dismissing the Letters Patent Appeal in limine have observed that Sections to have no connection whatsoever with the Indian Fatal Accidents Act and that they constitute a self contained code for the adjudication of claims to compensation on behalf of the victims of a motor accident and the <ORG> provided a complete machinery for the adjudication of such claims As I said even <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> have not specifically dealt with the question whether the abovesaid sections of the Act are only procedural in character or they constitute substantive law Anyway the decision of <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> cannot be treated as a precedent in view of the fact that the judgment was not rendered after full arguments and it was only a dismissal of the Letters Patent Appeal even at the admission stage that an argument addressed at motion hearing is rarely full and that a decision given at such a hearing must be held to be one given by the learned Judge per incuriam and that such a decision by a Court per incuriam is not binding as a precedent it has been held that decisions rendered without hearing both the sides are not entitled to great weight are all judgments of the Delhi <ORG> expressing the contrary view In these decisions the view expressed by <NAME> and <NAME> in <ORG> <ORG> A and the other cases which take a similar view have not been considered a Division Bench of this Court referred to the decision of <NAME> The claimant in the case before <ORG> is the mother of the victim who would be entitled to claim loss of benefit under Section A of the Fatal Accidents Act as well as loss to the estate of the deceased as a person representing his estate The learned Judges said in respect of the determination of the quantum that the decisions rendered under the general law of tort and under the Fatal Accidents Act will undoubtedly be relevant and constitute broad guidelines but they would not be binding on the <ORG> in the sense that the method of approach should be the same and identical as in the cases arising under the Fatal Accidents Act The only other decision which has to be referred to in this connection is <NAME> <NAME> A The sister as a person representing the estate of her deceased brother would certainly be entitled to claim compensation for loss to the estate of the deceased In allowing the appeal the learned Judge has observed that the Motor Vehicles Act is a special enactment and that it excludes the general enactment viz If the claim is towards loss of benefit it should necessarily be under the Fatal Accidents Act and without invoking the provisions therein there is no scope for awarding compensation for loss of benefit The resulting position form the above discussion is that in respect of applications under Section A of the Act for the death of a person in a motor accident the claimants must prove that the accident amounted to a tortious act and if that is proved compensation can be awarded for loss of benefit to the claimants if they are dependents as contemplated under the provisions of the Fatal Accidents Act and compensation can also be awarded towards loss to the estate of the deceased whether the claimants are dependants under the Fatal Accidents Act or not However I may mention that it is settled law that while fixing the quantum of compensation towards loss of benefit any pecuniary advantage received by the claimants upon the death of the deceased should also be taken into consideration and compensation awarded towards loss to the estate of the deceased would also be such pecuniary advantage which should be taken into consideration in assessing the quantum towards loss of benefit If there is pecuniary advantage to the claimants that should go in reduction of the quantum of compensation awarded towards loss of benefit Any one who represents the estate of the deceased would be entitled to claim compensation towards loss to the estate Such person who represents the estate need not necesarily be the heir of the deceased If a person who is injured lives for sometime but later succumbs to the injuries sustained in the accident a person who represents the estate of the deceased can claim damages for the pain and suffering of the deceased as well as loss of earnings and other damages actually suffered by the victim between the date of the accident and the date of death Therefore there was no pain and suffering to the deceased or any loss of earning from the time of accident till the time of death There is also nothing to show that the deceased suffered any other damages due to the accident It was found as a matter of fact by the trial Judge that in spite of old age the injured had been in good health and good condition and in the ordinary course of events could expect to have lived for at least a further or years There was a compendious award of towards pain and suffering physical disabilities and loss of expectation of life is referred to by <ORG> and they held that the principle laid down in that case viz that damages can be claimed for loss of expectation of life is not confined to the case where the injured person is alive at the date of the action and therefore the said damages can be claimed by the representative of the estate of the deceased as part of loss to the estate as a cause of action which entitled the injured to sue for loss of expectation of life survived to the person representing the estate of the injured who died under the Law Reform Miscellaneous Provisions Act It is pointed out that damages given for shortening of life loss of expectation of life should not be calculated solely or even mainly on the basis of the length of life that is lost but they should be fixed at a reasonable figure for the loss of a measure of prospective happiness It is also pointed out that if the character or habits of the deceased are calculated to head him to a future of unhappiness or despondency that would be a circumstance justifying a smaller award The question thus resolves itself into that of fixing a reasonable figure to be paid by way of damages for the loss of a measure of prospective happiness Such a problem might seem more suitable for discussion in an essay on Aristotelian Ethics than in the judgment of a <ORG> of law but in view of the earlier authorities we must do our best to contribute to its solution I would rather say that before damages are awarded in respect of the shortened life of a given individual under this head it is necessary for the <ORG> to be satisfied that the circumstances of the individual life were calculated to lead on balance to a positive measure of happiness of which the victim has been deprived by the defendant negligence If the character or habits of the individual were calculated to lead him to a future of unhappiness or despondency that would be a circumstance justifying a smaller award It is significant that at any rate in one case we were informed the jury refused to award any damages under this head at all special cases suggest themselves where the termination of a life of constant pain and suffering cannot be regarded as inflicting injury or at any rate as inflicting the same injury as in more normal cases I would further lay it down that in assessing damages for this purpose the question is not whether the deceased had the capacity or ability to appreciate that his further life on earth would bring him happiness the test is not subjective and the right sum to award depends on an objective estimate of what kind of future on earth the victim might have enjoyed whether he had justly estimated that future or not Of course no regard must be had to financial losses or gains during the period of which the victim has been deprived the claim was towards loss of expectation of life claimed by the mother of a victim who was aged years and months on the date of accident is a case where the wife of a person who was killed in an accident claimed damages for loss of expectation of life If there are materials to show that the victim would not have led a happy life if he had not been killed in the accident the assessment of compensation for loss of expectation of life has to be lower than in normal cases <ORG> held in one case that the estate could recover for the loss of future happiness of the victim but Viscount <NAME> was soon to persuade his fellow Law Lords that this claim should be strictly contained the result is that no more than or so is recoverable by the estate for this The estate cannot claim for loss of earnings in the period during which the victim would otherwise have lived there is no claim for future loss of amenities or limbs and the like I would quote the relevant passage In assessing damages under this head regard must be had to the injured party normal expectation of life and not to his expectation of life in his injured condition or to the fact that his injuries are such that he does not want his life to be prolonged or does not know it has been shortened Loss of the wages he would have earned during the years by which his life has been reduced are to be disregarded There was no prospect of his earning anything more in the years to come and there was no question of his saving anything out of it Considering these facts <NAME> held that the deceased could have expect to be looked after well and maintained comfortably by his sons and that therefore by his death there was loss of prospective happiness to the deceased that the assessment of the same at Rs This sum was arrived at by taking into consideration inter alia the reasonable provision the deceased if alive would have made for them That figure represents the damages for the mental agony suffering and loss of expectation of life There was no duplication in awarding damages under both the heads Their Lordships of <ORG> stress the fact that the right of action in respect of compensation for loss of benefit and that towards loss to the estate are quite distinct and independent and that there was nothing wrong in awarding compensation under both the heads even though the claimants may be the same However there can be no dispute that any sum paid to a dependant of the deceased who is entitled to compensation towards loss of benefit as compensation for loss to the estate would be a pecuniary advantage to him But for the death of the deceased there would be no occasion for the said dependant to receive compenation towards loss to the estate as a person representing the estate of the deceased Their Lordships of <ORG> do recognise this for they quote with approval Rose Ford A cases of the Courts in England which make it clear that when the claimant under both the heads is the same the sum awarded towards loss to the estate should go in reduction of compensation for loss of benefit had been awarded under the other head but there is nothing to show that in that case <ORG> in fixing the quantum of compensation towards loss of benefit had not taken into consideration the award under the other head Only under such circumstances it has been held that there was no ground to reduce the sum of Rs awarded towards loss of benefit on the alleged ground that there was duplication in awarding damages referred to by us earlier and some other decisions of the Courts in England have been referred to by their Lordships of <ORG> with approval though for the other aspect viz that the two heads of claim are independent of each other but when the claimant is the same the amount awarded towards loss to the estate should go in reduction of compensation for loss of benefit Nowhere in the judgment of <ORG> there is any observation that the expected future earnings of the deceased or the savings there form is part of loss of expectation of life or any other item of loss to the estate So on the head of loss to the estate of the deceased the only ground on which compensation can be awarded in this case is loss of expectation of life viz If the deceased had not been killed but only crippled and thereby there was shortening of his life he himself would have been entitled to claim compensation for loss of expectation of life Accordingly the appeal is allowed to the extent that there will be an award in favour of the appellants claimants before the <ORG> below for rupees five thousand which sum is payable by the nd respondent the insurance company within a month from this date Kailasam The facts of the case have been fully set out by nay learned brother and need not be reiterated The questions that arise in this Civil Miscellaneous Appeal are whether the accident was due to the negligence on the part of the driver of the lorry and whether the claimants who are the brothers and sisters of the person who was killed in the accident are persons entitled to compensation under Section A of the Motor Vehicles Act I have no hesitation in concurring with the finding of my learned brother that the driver of the lorry was guilty of negligence Regarding the question whether the brothers and the sisters of the deceased are entitled to claim compensation there could be no difficulty in holding that they are entitled to compensation towards loss of estate of the deceased but not as claimants under Section A of the Indian Fatal Accidents Act VIII of It has been held by this Court in Palani Ammal The Safe Service Limited A The case law on this subject has been fully discussed by my learned brother and I agree with the preponderance of judicial opinion and the conclusion arrived at by my learned brother that the provisions in Sections A to of the Motor Vehicles Act are only procedural and do not purport to confer any substantial right or liability on the parties I agree with the conclusion of my learned brother that all persons who are entitled to make an application for compensation under Section A of the Motor Vehicles Act will be legal representatives of the deceased within the meaning of the said section but I am unable to associate myself with the view that the definition of the term legal representative in Section of the Code of Civil Procedure would not include all persons who are entitled to apply for compensation under Section A of the Motor Vehicles Act and that Rule of the Madras Motor Accidents Claims Tribunals Rules which provides that the term legal representative shall have the meaning assigned to it under Clause of Section of On our conclusion that all claimants under Section A of the Motor Vehicles Act are legal representatives of the deceased and are entitled to compensation as provided for under Section strictly the question as to whether in view of the scope of the definition of the term legal representative in Section of the Code of Civil Procedure Rule of the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunals Rules is ultra vires or not does not arise in this case But as the question had been discussed at some length by my learned brother I would indicate my opinion briefly In Indian law while in earlier cases a strict meaning was given to the expression legal representative subsequently the term was construed to cover all persons representing the estate of the deceased person Under the old Code a strict meaning was given to the term legal representative as in the English law <NAME> in repelling the contention that the term should be construed strictly and cannot include anybody except the heir executor or administrator of the deceased as the term and the definition were taken from English law and that when the <ORG> used the term legal representative in the section and not the word representative it must have intended to use it in the strict sense observed that the section appears to have been drawn for the protection of the decree holders and to give them a right to relief against the successor in property or estate of the deceased judgment debtor The learned Judge held that the term legal representative appears to have been used as one which would cover ordinary cases of succession The definition has also been extended to the case of a person who without title as administrator executor heir revensioner or surviving coparcener is the de facto possessor of the estate of the deceased Hindu it having been held that he must be treated for some purposes as his representative and that a judgment obtained against such a representative is not a mere nullity After an elaborate review of the authorities the learned Judge summed up the position thus From this review of the authorities it Will appear that judicial decisions have extended the sense of the term legal representative beyond that of its ordinary meaning of administrator executor and heir and though such extension has been attended with doubt and has in some cases been the subject of conflicting decisions it appears to me to be too late now to endeavour however convenient it might be to secure for the term that which is perhaps its strict and legitimate sense I agree therefore in holding that the term is not limited to administrators executors and heirs and am of opinion that it must now be held to include any person who in law represents the estate of a deceased judgment debtor The definition of the term legal representative in Section of the Code of Civil Procedure is too wide and the <ORG> has in fact given effect to the views expressed in <NAME> <NAME> and introduced the present definition of the term legal representative in Section of the Code of Civil Procedure which reads as follows Legal representative means a person who in law represents the estate of a deceased person and includes any person who intermeddless with the estate of the deceased and where a party sues or is sued in a representative character the person on whom the estate devolves on the death of the party so suing or sued According to the present definition the term legal representative is very wide in its amplitude and covers all persons who in law represent the estate of the deceased person are all omitted and what is now required is that the person must in law represent the estate of the deceased person The Court held that the whole object of widening the scope of the expression legal representative which the present definition is intended to achieve would be frustrated if it is held that legatees of different portions of the estate of a deceased do not fall within its purview Thus it is settled law that any person who becomes entitled to a part of the estate can be held to represent the estate and thereby a legal representative of the deceased The point that arises is whether a person who claims compensation on the death of a person is a person who in law represents the estate of the deceased person Section A of the Fatal Accidents Act provides that a suit for compensation to the family of a person for loss occasioned to it by his death by actionable wrong is maintainable The section provides that such a suit shall be for the benefit of the wife husband parent or child if any of the person whose death has been caused and it shall be brought by and in the name of the executor administrator or representative of the person deceased In such an action the <ORG> will award damages in proportion to the loss resulting from such death to the parties respectively for whom and for whose benefit such action shall be brought The amount shall be divided amongst the parties mentioned in such shares as the <ORG> by its judgment or decree shall direct Section provides that not more than one action or suit shall be brought in respect of the same subject matter of complaint and that in any such suit or action the executor administrator or representative of the deceased may insert a claim for and recover any pecuniary loss to the estate of the deceased occasioned by such wrongful act neglect or default which sum when recovered shall be deemed part of the assets of the estate of the deceased The learned Judges in summing up the provisions of Sections A and of the Act observed as follows In cases where the deceased is represented by an executor or an administrator such an executor or administrator is given the power to sue for the compensation for the benefit of the specified relations Where there is no executor or administrator or where there is one and he fails or is unwilling to sue then in our opinion the suit may be instituted by and in the name of the representative of the person But one suit only is allowed to enforce the claims of all the persons beneficially entitled it being provided that the rights of each and every one of them shall be adjudged and adjusted by the <ORG> in such suit The right of each beneficiary is only to receive compensation in proportion to the loss occasioned to him by the death of his deceased relative Regarding the term representative of the deceased the Court held that there was no reason for limiting the meaning of the word in a narrow way and found that the word meant and included all or any one of the persons for whose benefit a suit under the Act can be maintained and that these persons are the representatives of the deceased in the sense that they are the persons taking the place of the deceased in obtaining reparation for the wrong done This decision is an authority for the proposition that the word representative of the deceased in Act XIII of would include any person who takes the place of the deceased for obtaining reparation for the wrong done To be a legal representative under Section of the Code of Civil Procedure a person in law must represent the estate of the deceased person When a person is taking the place of the deceased as his representative it would follow that he represents also the estate of the deceased especially when the procedure contemplated under the Act enabled the executor administrator or representative of the deceased to file a suit on behalf of the dependants and others with equal force will apply to the term legal representative and the persons taking the place of the deceased for obtaining reparation for the wrong done will not only be representatives for the purpose of the Act XIII of but also under Section of the Code of Civil Procedure It would be too narrow a construction that though the persons taking the place of the deceased are representatives of the deceased they are not the representatives of the deceased estate is that the term representative would apply to any person taking the place of the deceased in a suit under Act XIII of which would include a claim for the benefit to the estate also It follows therefore that the definition of the term legal representative in the context is wide enough to cover all persons who can maintain a claim for compensation taking the place of the deceased person As in this case the question does not arise as the deceased who was a labourer would not have accumulated any earnings for future during his life time the petitioners would not be entitled to any increase in the compensation awarded to them on the ground of likely loss of future earnings or savings therefrom occasioned to the estate of the deceased
