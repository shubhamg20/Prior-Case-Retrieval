Lakshmanan JUDGMENT <NAME> By these four appeals we are called upon to consider the legality correctness and validity of the impugned Notification dated appointing <NAME> as the President of <ORG> at Ahmedabad A Notification dated in this regard was issued by the order of Governor by <ORG> of the Government of Gujarat in the Gujarat Government Gazette whereby <NAME> had been appointed as the President of <ORG> which was under challenge before <ORG> in Special Civil Application Nos and filed by <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> and Surat Textile Labour Union <ORG> by its judgment dated allowed the applications and quashed the said Notification dated <ORG> further directed the respondents to proceed to make the appointment afresh on the post of the President of <ORG> Gujarat in the light of what has been held in the said order and in accordance with law By order dated this Court granted leave and made the interim order absolute All these appeals involve common question of law based on same set of facts therefore we propose to decide these appeals by a common judgment The brief facts leading to the filing of the applications are briefly stated as under The Bombay Industrial Relations Act hereinafter referred to as the I Act governs the relationship between the employers and workmen in several industries operating in Gujarat and more particularly the Industry of Textile the Industry of Power in the late Bombay State area of Gujarat the Surat Industry the Banking Industry run by Banking Companies having no branches outside the State of Gujarat Sections and of the I Act thereof provide for setting up of <ORG> and <ORG> Section of the I Act provides that every Member of the <ORG> shall be a person who is or has been a Judge of <ORG> or is eligible for being appointed a Judge of such Court provided inter alia that a person who has been a Judge not lower in rank than that of Assistant Judge for not less than three years or a person who has been the Presiding Officer of <ORG> for not less than five years shall also be eligible for appointment as a Member of the <ORG> According to the respondents there are twelve Members of the <ORG> functioning in Gujarat State and so far as the <ORG> are concerned there are Judges functioning in Gujarat four of them are Judges who have completed more than ten years service as <ORG> Judges and several more <ORG> Judges are those who have completed more than five years service as <ORG> Judges and are therefore eligible for being appointed as Members of the <ORG> It was further argued before the High court that for Members of the <ORG> there is no other avenue of promotion except one by way of appointment as President of the <ORG> and now if the post of President is to be filled up by bringing someone from Judicial Service it will cause a great frustration among Members of the <ORG> as their hopes of promotion at an appropriate time will be dashed to the ground Opposing the applications it was submitted by the respondents appellants herein that no illegality was committed by recommending the name of <NAME> for appointment as the President of the <ORG> and that under Rules and of the Draft Recruitment Rules it has become necessary for the <ORG> on its administrative side to recommend the appointment of an appropriate person by nomination on the said post under Rule and that <NAME> whose name was recommended is fulfilling the criteria prescribed by the <ORG> as per the old Rules as well It was submitted that considering the totality of the facts the <ORG> of Gujarat had not only acted within its rights but the same had been done in due discharge of the Constitutional duty In the rejoinder affidavit it was submitted that neither the appointment order nor the reply affidavit filed on behalf of the <ORG> shows that the appointment was made by the Governor of the State and that there is nothing to show that the Full Court was consulted by the appointing authority before making the appointment It was further stated that assuming that the appointment by nomination can be made on the post of a President of the <ORG> either under the old Rules pertaining to the post of President or under the new Rules which are at the draft stage only the candidate concerned should have atleast for ten years either held a judicial post in India or should have been an advocate for <ORG> or should have expert knowledge of Industrial matters According to the petitioners respondents herein the appointee under the impugned appointment had not hold a judicial post for ten years and in fact he was holding the post of Joint District Judge only and he had not even completed three years on the post of Additional District Judge to which post he was directly recruited <ORG> of <ORG> by its judgment held that a reading of Section of the I Act would show that it provides for the constitution of <ORG> with three or more Members one of whom as its President and it also provides the eligibility for appointment as Member of <ORG> <ORG> further held that the absence of any Rules with regard to the appointment on the post of President of <ORG> except the existing Draft Rules framed by <ORG> and the Rules as had been framed under proviso to Article of the Constitution vide Gujarat Government Gazette dated being only for recruitment for the post of Member <ORG> and the Rules for appointment of President <ORG> as contained in the Hand Book that too not in consultation with <ORG> the only relevant provision which can be traced is Section of the I Act and according to Section of the I Act one of the Members of <ORG> has to be the President <ORG> further held that there was no lawful justification for excluding the candidates who were holding the post of Member <ORG> and whereas they have been kept out of consideration on the basis of the proposed Draft Rules the consideration for making the appointment to the post in question stands vitiated Elaborating further <ORG> held In the first instance there is no question of appointment by nomination on the basis of the proposed Draft Rules by holding that existing Members were not eligible because they have not completed five years as Member We find that the procedure which has been adopted and which has led to the impugned appointment is not in conformity either with the general right of equality under Article of the Constitution of India and with the right of equality in matters relating to employment as contemplated by Article of the Constitution of India and therefore this appointment cannot be sustained in the eye of law It is also not in dispute that the respondent No had never been appointed as Member of <ORG> and in terms of Section of the Bombay Industrial Relations Act without being a Member of <ORG> there is no question of his appointment as the President of <ORG> either by promotion or by direct recruitment When the Act has not put any such fetter and the Act contemplates that one of the Members of the <ORG> shall be the President and it is not stated that he must complete certain years of service as Member through executive instructions such a requirement could not be pressed so as to defeat the right of consideration of the Members of the <ORG> for consideration of the post of the President In our considered opinion Section of the Bombay Industrial Relations Act is the only relevant provision to be taken note of for the purpose of appointment of the President and the only mode of appointment is by way of promotion from amongst the Members of <ORG> and in this regard if any Rules are to be framed in exercise of the powers under Chapter VI of Part VI of the Constitution of India the same cannot be inconsistent with the requirements of the Bombay Industrial Relations Act <ORG> for the reasons stated above quashed the Notification which is impugned in the applications and further directed the respondents therein to proceed to make the appointment afresh on the post of the President of <ORG> Gujarat in the light of what has been held in the said order and in accordance with law Learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants submitted that the provisions of Section of the I Act clearly spells out that apart from the mode of selecting the President by promotion from amongst the Members the President can also directly be appointed from the sitting or retired <ORG> Judges Per contra <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing for the respondents apart from reiterating the contentions in the applications submitted that Section of the I Act clearly indicates that only Member of <ORG> is eligible for becoming the President of the <ORG> and that becoming Member of the <ORG> is sine qua non for being considered for the post of President of the <ORG> He further submitted that unless one is or has been the Judge of <ORG> the post of the President of the <ORG> could be filled up only and only by way of promotion because there exist only one post for the whole State of Gujarat It was further contended that the appointment on a judicial post can be made only by His Excellency the Governor under Article of the Constitution of India and the State Government cannot issue Notification appointing Judicial Officer under the business rules by and in the name of His Excellency the Governor of the State He further submitted that even assuming the appointment to the post of President can be made through nomination or direct recruitment all the Members of the <ORG> were qualified for being appointed as President of the <ORG> by nomination in accordance with the Draft Rules that were relied upon by the Government supporting the appointment of <NAME> and that the Members of the <ORG> were eligible for appointment by nomination according to the Draft Rules also and that Rule ii of the Draft Rules provides inter alia that appointment to the post of President shall be made either a by promotion from amongst the Members of the <ORG> on the basis of seniority cum merit subject to the provision that for being considered as eligible for such promotion the Member concerned should have completed five years service as a Member of the <ORG> by nomination It was further contended that the appointment of Shri <NAME> straightaway by nomination without taking into consideration the cases of nomination of existing Members of <ORG> who had completed ten years functioning as a Judicial Officer has been rightly held by the <ORG> as violative of Articles and of the Constitution of India and that therefore no public appointment can be made in disregard of consideration of the cases of those who were qualified for the post Arguing further learned senior counsel for the respondents submitted that the appointment of a Junior Judicial Officer as President of <ORG> without considering the cases of existing Members of <ORG> who are senior on the basis of longer experience on equivalent post will also not be conducive to the judicial service which according to him will result in a Junior Judicial Officer presiding over <ORG> who have Members far senior to the President and that Junior Judicial Officer will thus exercise administrative powers of control over undisputedly Senior Judicial Officers It was further submitted that assuming that a District Judge can be directly appointed to the post of President <ORG> carrying a higher pay scale than that of the District Judges in Gujarat and assuming that even if somebody is already a Member of the Judiciary he can be nominated or directly appointed and that he did not pass through the channel of promotion or selection meant for those who are already in service in view of Article of the Constitution even in that case there was no justification for <ORG> on the administrative side to pick up <NAME> who was th in the list of seniority at the relevant time He submitted that the appointment of <NAME> was also vitiated on account of the fact that if nomination or direct recruitment was a permissible course in the matter of appointment of the President of <ORG> then a large number of <ORG> Judges Advocates apart from the Members of <ORG> who had completed ten years of practice or seven years of judicial work were also qualified for that appointment and therefore they could not be excluded from consideration Concluding his arguments he submitted that <ORG> conclusion that Section of the I Act does not provide for nomination or direct recruitment and someone has to be appointed from amongst the Members of <ORG> only is correct and that there is no other provision in the entire I Act to provide for the mode of appointment of the President of <ORG> We have given our thoughtful consideration on the rival submissions made by the respective counsel appearing on either side Before proceeding to consider the rival submissions it is useful to reproduce the relevant provisions governing the controversy which run as follows Section Every member of <ORG> shall be a person who is not connected with the industrial dispute referred to such court or with any industry directly affected by such dispute Provided that no person shall be deemed to be connected with the industrial dispute or with the industry by reason only of the fact that he is a shareholder of an incorporated company which is connected with or likely to be affected by such industrial dispute but in such a case he shall disclose to <ORG> the nature and extent of the shares held by him in such company Every member of <ORG> shall be a person who is or has been a judge of <ORG> or is eligible for being appointed a judge of such Court Provided that a a person who has been a Judge not lower in rank than that of Assistant Judge for not less than three years or a person who has been the presiding officer of <ORG> constituted under any law for the time being in force for not less than five years or a person who holds a degree in law of a <ORG> established by law in any part of India and is holding or has held an office not lower in rank than that of Assistant Commissioner of Labour under <ORG> for not less than ten years shall also be eligible for appointment as a member of <ORG> The appointment of President <ORG> Gujarat shall be made by the Governor of Gujarat in consultation with <ORG> and <ORG> either a by promotion from amongst the Members <ORG> on the basis of seniority cum merits provided that a person shall not be eligible to be promoted to the post of President <ORG> unless he has completed five years service on the post of Member <ORG> or by nomination A person appointed by direct recruitment shall normally be on probation for a period of one year and shall have to pass an Examination in Hindi and or Gujarati according to the Rules prescribed by the <ORG> In the background of the facts and circumstances and the provisions of law extracted above the following points arise for consideration by this Court a What is the true scope and interpretation of Section read with Section of the I Act Whether Section of the I Act can be read to mean that the President of <ORG> must be appointed from among the existing Members of <ORG> when the provision in fact is not in such terms Whether the reading of the provisions of Section of the I Act clearly spells out that apart from the mode of selecting the President by promotion from amongst the Members the President can also directly be appointed from the sitting or retired <ORG> Judges or from the Judges of <ORG> Ahmedabad and District Judges who fulfills the eligibility requirement for appointment as Member of <ORG> Whether <ORG> has failed to appreciate that Section of the I Act does not envisage the mode of appointment Our attention was drawn to the relevant pleadings filed before <ORG> and also in this Court The circumstances and the process which had culminated in the appointment of <NAME> as the President of <ORG> had been fully narrated in the affidavit in reply filed on behalf of respondent No in <ORG> Under these circumstances it was decided to place the matter for consideration of <ORG> of <ORG> of Gujarat as to by which mode the post of the President <ORG> is to be filled up Accordingly the said matter was considered by <ORG> of <ORG> of Gujarat and it was decided on that the post of President <ORG> Ahmedabad be filled up by nomination under clause of Rule of the proposed Rules as none of the present Members of <ORG> is eligible to be appointed to the said post by promotion having not completed five years service on the post of Member <ORG> The claim of all the incumbents of the post of Member of <ORG> was examined in light of the criteria prescribed by <ORG> of Gujarat for appointment on the post of President of <ORG> It was decided by <ORG> to fill up the post of President of <ORG> by nomination as stated above In the light of the decision of <ORG> to fill up the post of the President of <ORG> by way of nomination it was further decided to ask for the willingness of the Judicial Officers working in the cadres of City Civil Court Judges and District Judges who are not less than years of age and have put in ten years of service in judiciary including the period of practice at the <ORG> for being considered for appointment in question Thereafter the said matter was placed for consideration of <ORG> of <ORG> of Gujarat and in the meeting of <ORG> held on it was decided to direct the office to resubmit the matter along with the recruitment Rules prescribing eligibility criteria for appointment to the post of President <ORG> As per the directions of <ORG> the matter was again placed before <ORG> for further consideration along with the Rule stated above In the meeting of <ORG> of <ORG> held on the consideration of the subject was deferred however in the meantime the office was directed to resubmit the matter pointing out the provisions of law in the matter particularly mentioning the provisions regarding eligibility experience and age of superannuation etc Pursuant to the said direction of <ORG> a detailed note was submitted for consideration of <ORG> and after considering all aspects in the meeting held on <ORG> had taken decision to the effect that the name of <NAME> Joint District Judge Vadodara may be recommended to <ORG> <ORG> for appointment as President of <ORG> Ahmedabad by nomination provided under the Recruitment Rules for the post in question In this connection <NAME> was called for personal hearing on and he was heard by the Chief Justice on the issue On the basis of what is stated above it is clear that the decision to fill up the post of the President of <ORG> by way of nomination as provided under the Rules was arrived at after considering all aspects not only that the process of selecting the person to be recommended to the Government was also undertaken transparently and before taking the decision the matter was considered from time and again by <ORG> of the High Court of Gujarat and after due consideration and deliberations the decision was taken to recommend the name of Shri <NAME> Considering the totality of the facts it is clear to us that there is neither illegality nor arbitrariness in taking the decision of recommending the name of Shri <NAME> for appointment on the post of President <ORG> Ahmedabad It is seen from the records that at the request of the <ORG> the eligibility criteria for appointment on the post of President <ORG> has been determined by <ORG> and the same has been incorporated in the Draft Recruitment Rules Shri <NAME> is eligible for the post of the President <ORG> Ahmedabad as he has completed ten years service in judiciary including the period of practice at the <ORG> In our opinion in the case of appointment of President of <ORG> by nomination it is not necessary that he must be appointed as Member at the first instance Section of the I Act deals with the composition of <ORG> which does not lay down the mode of appointment Based on the recommendation of <ORG> on its administrative side the <ORG> of Gujarat issued the Notification on whereby <NAME> had been appointed as the President of <ORG> In other words the <ORG> failed to appreciate that once a person is appointed as the President of <ORG> he automatically becomes a Member The State Government therefore referred to <ORG> for consultation and approval of the Rules
