Aggrieved by such action respondent No filed an original application being <ORG> No of under Section of the Administrative <ORG>s Act the Act for brevity He prayed for quashing the letter of the <ORG> respondent No dated in which the seniority of un official respondent Nos to was fixed from the date of initial time scale DOITS in He also prayed for a direction to the petitioner to refix his DOITS in counting weightage of five years from the year of vacancy Aggrieved by the same respondent No again filed <ORG> No of before the Central <ORG> praying to quash the <ORG> letter dated wherein his seniority was fixed with effect from and for quashing the tetter dated of the Secretary <ORG> which was the basis for passing the order on by respondent No rejecting the representation made by the first respondent on The learned <ORG> allowed the <ORG> in the following terms In view of what is stated above we have no hesitation to come to the conclusion that the applicant should be shown as having been promoted to <ORG> in the vacancies that arose for promotion from Group to Group A service in the year On that basis he should also be given antedated seniority in accordance with the principles laid down by order dated If the principle laid down by the <ORG> is allowed to stand whenever there is delay in constitution of <ORG> the subsequent promotions in accordance with the recommendations of <ORG> would have to be dated back which would result in violation of Articles and of the Constitution of India Though there were vacancies in the petitioners did not hold <ORG> in relation to the vacancies whiclx arose in and respondent No was only considered in and therefore the petitioners are bound to give weightage of five years and refix the DOITS five years anterior to i He also submits that when <ORG> is required to fill up vacancies in the ratio of by direct recruitment and by promotion filling up vacancies from only one source is against rules and cannot be sustained If the first respondent is not given weightage of five years to be reckoned from he would become junior to direct recruits which violates the fundamental right under Article of the Constitution of India In the light of the rival contentions presented before us the point that arises for consideration is whether the first respondent is entitled for weightage from the date of appointment to <ORG> of Group A of <ORG> with effect from or is he entitled for such weightage anterior to the year of allotment i It is one of the principles of fixation of seniority that whenever there is recruitment to a particular service from two sources i direct recruitment and promotion the seniority of promotees is fixed by giving wcightage in the form of seniority in the service subject to certain conditions Weightage principle is generally applied also in a situation when persons in a feeder category come from two different lower categories and are required to fulfil two different kinds of eligibility criteria weightage of service means that though a promotee is given promotion to a cadre post or higher post in the non cadre post his seniority will be reckoned from a date anterior to the date of promotion because in every year of recruitment the rule obligates to maintain the ratio of recruitment between direct recruits and promotees Cases have come up with regularity where the question mostly involved the application of the rules than the vires of the rules According to the impugned letter seniority list the inter se seniority of all the <ORG> officers who were substantively appointed to <ORG> of <ORG> was prepared giving DOITS by applying principle vi of the principles for determining the relative seniority vide <ORG> letter No SR dated as amended by letter dated and all other relevant factor Between these two dates there was no officer who was given DOITS with reference to which is now claimed by respondent No By letter dated <ORG> in Ministry of Railways with the approval of the President of India circulated principles for determining the seniority of officers appointed to various Class I services from different sources for short the principles Principle i states that the seniority of officers appointed to class I shall be determined on the basis of date for increment on time scale DOITS to be specifically determined in each case in accordance with the principles laid down therein Principle ii is to the effect that all such officers promoted to class I shall count their seniority from the date they commence earning increments in the regular scale as Assistant Officers subject to condition that inter se seniority of officers in each service recruited as probationers in a particular year will be regulated by their place in order of merit Subject to the aforesaid provision the seniority of officers permanently promoted from Class II to Class I services shall be determined by giving weightage based on a the year of service connoted by the initial pay on permanent promotion to Class I Service or Half the total number of years of continuous service in Class both officiating and permanent Whichever is higher subject to a maximum weightage of five years Principle vii in the letter dated was renumbered as principle vi and after amendment it reads as follows Principle vi In the case of Group officers permanently promoted to Group A services if two or more officers are promoted on the same date their relative seniority will be in the order of selection subject to the aforesaid provision the seniority of officers permanently promoted from Group to Group A service shall be determined by giving weightage based on a the year of service connoted by the initial pay on permanent promotion to Group A service or half the total number of years of continuous service in Group both officiating and permanent whichever is more subject to a maximum of years provided that the weightage so assigned does not exceed the total non fortuitous service rendered by the officer in Group Secondly the weightage so assigned does not exceed the total non fortuitous service rendered in <ORG> In our considered opinion if respondent <NAME> contention is accepted that he is entitled for weightage of five years from the same would violate the second condition in the sense that admittedly the petitioner was promoted to <ORG> on and he had worked for a little more than five years in STS <ORG> If his seniority is considered from the same would exceed the total non fortuitous service rule of year which is impermissible By applying the relevant principle for determining the relative seniority of the Class I Officers of <ORG> for reckoning weightage of seniority DOITS worked out to that is to say five years weightage from the date of substantive appointment by promotion on Accordingly they were given weightage in the JS Grade I from and seniority was reckoned from that date of substantive appointment Later as they were completed five years of service by in JS Grade I they were posted in Senior Scale Grade A of IRPS immediately after their joining in their respective <ORG> in JS Grade I They were also promoted to Junior Administrative Grade with effect from by reckoning their service from as they have completed eight years of service and eligible for consideration to Junior Administrative Grade and their seniority was circulated which was the subject matter of challenge by <NAME> before <ORG> Principal Bench <ORG> allowed the OA and hence the appellants carried the matter to <ORG> Placing reliance on principle vi of the principles for determining the relative seniority of Class I Group A officers <ORG> found fault with the order of <ORG> It was observed therein as under It is settled law that the appointing authority or the appropriate <ORG> can frame rules governing seniority which are reasonable keeping in mind the divergent claims that can be put forward by the various categories of the members of the service It is however necessary that there should be no discrimination that is persons placed in the same group must be treated similarly and further that any principle which is made the basis of determination of seniority should if applicable to others be applied to them also In other words if seniority is to depend purely upon the date of confirmation or the date of appointment that rule should be applicable to all but if the promotees and special recruits are being given weightage the principles applicable to the members of the service should be kept in mind while determining the weightage to be given or while laying down rules for determination of seniority <NAME> case supra involved the interpretation of <ORG> Regulation of Seniority Rules and the case was decided on the facts peculiar to it and no principle or ratio was laid down therein The relevant interpretation of the regulations is as under It must therefore held that in view of the provisions contained in Regulation unless there is a good reason for not doing so <ORG> is required to meet every year for the purpose of making the selection from amongst <ORG> Civil Service Officers who fulfil the conditions regarding eligibility on the first day of the January of the year in which the <ORG> meets and fall within the zone of consideration as prescribed in clause of Regulation The failure on the part of <ORG> to meet during a particular year would not dispense with the requirement of preparing the Select List for that year It was held It is true that filling up of the posts are for clear or anticipated vacancies arising in the year It is settled law that mere inclusion of one name in the list does not confer any right on him her to appointment In <NAME> <NAME> of Bihar Supp SCC ATC it was held that mere inclusion of one name in the panel does not confer on him her any indefeasible right to appointment It is further held that the purpose of making a panel was to finalise the list of eligible candidates for appointment The preparation of the panel should be the exact to the notified or anticipated vacancies However in the light of the above principles and in the light of the clear rules extracted therein before it is seen that the exercise of preparation of the panel is undertaken well in advance to fill up the clear vacancies or anticipated vacancies The preparation and finalisation of the yearly panel unless duly certified by the appointing authority that no vacancy would arise or no suitable candidate was available is a mandatory requirement If the annual panel could not be prepared for any justifiable reason year wise panel of the eligible candidates within the zone of consideration for filling up the vacancies each year should be prepared and appointment made in accordance therewith This judgment of <ORG> refers to the principles of seniority contained in letter dated of <ORG> on two earlier cases and having regard to the principles laid down in the cases of <NAME> and <NAME> supra came to the conclusion that the principle of weightage which is also proposed by <ORG> in their letters was unassailable The decisions of <ORG> in <ORG> Maharashtra Vikrikar Karmachari Sanghatan and Shanmukham cases supra cited by petitioner Counsel did not deal with the principle of weightage while fixing seniority of the promotccs and they deal with the question of consideration of period of ad hoc promotion for the purpose of reckoning seniority and therefore it is not necessary to refer to these judgments In <ORG> case supra the question was as to whether the delay in filling up the vacant posts would confer any right on the person promoted subsequently to claim seniority from the date when the vacancy arose or from the year the vacancy was available <NAME> dealing with Indian Administrative Service Cadre Rules and IAS Fixation of Cadre Strength Regulations <ORG> held that even when the vacancy exists to be filled up by promotion from non cadre service holders the <ORG> is not bound to fill up those vacancies The basis of the petitioners right to be selected for <ORG> is traceable in case of <ORG> Civil Service Officers to Rule of the Recruitment Rules which says that <ORG> may recruit AS persons by promotion from amongst the members of the <ORG> civil service This Rule itself puts a ceiling on the number of posts that could be filled in IAS from such promotions which are limited to not more than of the posts enumerated therein The question then arises whether there is any such right in the petitioners to seek such creation of additional posts It is a well settled principle in service jurisprudence that even when there is a vacancy the <ORG> is not bound to fill up such vacancy nor is there any corresponding right vested in an eligible employee to demand that such post be filled up This is because the decision to fill up a vacancy or not vest with the employer who for good reasons be it administrative economical or policy can decide not to fill up such post The officers may have a legitimate expectation but they cannot have any enforceable right either to compel constitution of <ORG> or to seek promotion with retrospective date for valid reasons <ORG> may be postponed ii The principle of weightage has to be applied having regard to other principles of seniority and cannot be construed or applied in a straight jacket formula iii The principle of weightage has to be applied by giving due weightage of service of five years from the date of substantive appointment and not from the year of allotment iv The principle of giving weightage of five years from the date of substantive appointment is fair and equitable procedure and cannot be held to violate Articles and of the Constitution of India The principle of giving weightage subject to condition that weightage assigned shall not exceed the total non fortuitous service rendered by the officer in the lower category and vi If the principle of giving five years of weightage in service in the promoted category is reckoned with reference to year of allotment the same would violate the principle of equity in Articles and of the Constitution of India in that even a person whose claims were rejected earlier or who was not qualified or who was not within the zone of consideration would get the benefit of weightage of five years of service which is illogical and illegal Be it noted that the year of service is always connoted by initial pay on permanent promotion and not promotion with reference to a panel year In this view of the matter the impugned judgment of the <ORG> suffers from error and is liable to be set aside which requires to be rectified by us in this petition for judicial review In the result for the aforesaid reasons we allow the writ petition and dismiss OA No of filed by the first respondent herein
