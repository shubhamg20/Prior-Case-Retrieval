The relevant words of the Kabulayat are as follows Neither I nor my heirs nor any agent acting on my behalf will create any encumbrance on the land or any portion of it by way of lease mortgage or sale or in any other manner On August th the plaintiff made an application to the District Deputy Collector in which he stated that the two lands were taken up jointly by himself and defendant No and prayed that Survey No might be transferred to the came of defendant No He said that he had paid the price of Survey No and prayed that it should be transferred to his name On November rd the District Deputy Collector held that there was a private arrangement between plaintiff and defendant No which constituted a breach of the conditions set out above and directed that the lands should be forfeited There is no dispute as to the above facts It may be remarked that if there was in fact a breach of the conditions of the <ORG> plaintiff would cease to be entitled to the occupation of the land as provided for by Section of the Bombay Land Revenue Code and would therefore be liable to be summarily evicted by the Collector in exercise of the powers conferred by Section A The lower Court holds that there was no agreement prior in date to the <ORG> and that is probably correct He says I do not remember if I and <NAME> paid half and half the amount that was first paid to <ORG> I asked <NAME> after he got the lands to give me No and he consented There is no evidence that any money was paid as purchase money and admittedly no document was executed There was at most a contract for sale which of itself creates no interest in or charge on the property Beyond this there was nothing more than an attempt or intention to transfer which was never carried into effect It may however be remarked that if there was indeed an antecedent arrangement such as was suggested by plaintiff and defendant No the case for applying A would be no stronger But it has been urged in appeal that the suit is barred by limitation This is a first appeal and the general rule is that effect should be given to a plea of limitation raised for the first time It may further be noted that the facts necessary for the consideration of this plea are in substance set out in the plaint itself which shows that the suit was filed more than a year after the date of the actual eviction It is argued for defendant No that the suit is barred by Article of Schedule I of the Indian Limitation Act The act of eviction it is urged was the act of an officer of Government in his official capacity and as the suit was admittedly brought more than a year after the date of that act it must be held to be barred In that case it was held that if a Collector disposed of land the property of a private individual purporting to act under Section of the Bombay Land Revenue Code the disposition is a nullity because Section does not give power to deal with the lands of private individuals It would appear to follow that the act of dispossession is equally a nullity not in the sense that it is a negligible quantity but in the sense that it is not an act done by an officer in his official capacity It therefore stands on no other footing than an act of dispossession by a private individual The District Deputy Collector held erroneously that the plaintiff was not entitled to the possession of certain land and the suit was filed more than a year after the order It was held that the order gave the plaintiff a cause of action but that as it was based on an erroneous view of the facts it was ultra vires The District Deputy Collector did not therefore act in his official capacity and Article had no application It seems to me impossible to escape the conclusion that here too by parity of reasoning the act was not done by the District Deputy Collector in his official capacity Where an officer of Government purports to act under a statutory authority but in fact acts in excess of that authority his act should be treated as a nullity This appears to be the view hitherto taken by this Court and no valid ground is shown for questioning it It would appear to follow that Article has no application here I would therefore reverse the decree of the lower Court and make a decree for possession and mesne profits under Order XX Rule of the Civil Procedure Code I desire to add a word with reference to the point of limitation raised on behalf of defendant No for the first time in the appeal before us Having regard to the nature of the point as also to the circumstance that it involves no investigation into any fresh facts we have considered the point of limitation It seems to me that the real question in the case is whether any breach of the conditions of the grant is established for if that is not established under the circumstances of this case the defendant No must fail on the merits as well as on the point of limitation Both on the question of fact as to the alleged breach of the conditions of the grant and on the question of law as to the effect of that finding on the point of limitation I entirely agree with my learned brother
