The petitioners in this writ petition numbering have challenged the quashing of the demand made by the respondent DDA vide their letter of demand received by the petitioners in September It has been further alleged by the petitioners that the draw of lot held on st August for the said category of registrants the <ORG> has demanded in Dilshad Garden East Delhi for MIG flats on ground floor Rupees According to the petitioners there is no justification for the <ORG> to ask more price in for the same category of registration at a higher price than those stated above On the other hand learned Counsel for the petitioners argued that the petitioners had to wait for years when <ORG> allotted flats to them The learned Counsel appearing for the petitioners vehemently argued that respondent authority is constituted under the Act of Parliament for providing amongst other things housing to the population of metropolitan city of Delhi at no profit no loss basis According to the petitioners the above clause was limited to the right of the respondent authority to revise and modify terms and conditions depending upon the exigencies of layout cost of construction but will not encompass in its fold power to disregard the scheme altogether and make exhorbitant demand as has been done in this case Respondent <ORG> has argued that in view of Clause of the brochure <ORG> reserves its right to alter any terms and conditions in its discretion as and when considered necessary According to them the prices demanded are totally reasonable and there is nothing unreasonable about the same It is further argued by learned Counsel for <ORG> that on account of tremendous rush under the Scheme a priority list was prepared according to which flats were allotted from time to time as per draw of lots according to seniority list The stand of the <ORG> is that prices of the flats have been arrived at after meticulous calculations and after taking into consideration all relevant considerations and there is nothing arbitrary or irrational about the same Counsel for the <ORG> has also relied upon <ORG> <NAME> and has argued that on that basis once the petitioner willingly enters into a contract with the public authority fully aware with the terms and conditions the petitioners are estopped from challenging the terms and conditions of the contract Lastly respondent has also contended that in view of Clause of the brochure wherein some of the areas where construction was likely to be undertaken or flats were constructed were mentioned that would not create a bar for construction being undertaken in other areas It is in this background that we have to examine the facts of this case The land in Delhi has been acquired by <ORG> from time to time There is an averment by the petitioner in the present case that the land was acquired by <ORG> much prior to the induction of Scheme of where the flats have been constructed Time and again we asked the counsel for <ORG> to tell us as to when the land in question was acquired where the petitioners are being allotted respective flats Nothing was made available before us to indicate that the land was acquired in or or thereafter or any period earlier to that We are discussing this aspect in order to understand the basis on which the <ORG> has enhanced the prices of flats in question There are three essential components which may have bearing in escalation of cost the land rate which includes cost of acquisition future cost and additional price which State has to incur on account of enhancement of compensation cost of construction and cost of administrative expenses which may include profit to the contractor if it is to be constructed by the outside agency particularly speaking these are the basic cost which are essential for determining the fixation of price apart from other incidental cost which may not vary the cost to a large extent The petitioners have filed the rejoinder in which specific instances were given which are A Mr <NAME> registered under the same Scheme called New Pattern Registration Scheme NPRS It may be stated that the area of Rohini is a much better locality as compared to Jahangirpuri and some other areas where flats have been offered to the petitioners A flat offered to the petitioner on rd floor in the area of Jahangirpuri is for Rs Mr <NAME> requested that a flat could be allotted to him somewhere in North Delhi By demand dated the flat was then offered to Mr <NAME> for Rupees The <ORG> was afforded an opportunity to file additional affidavit to explain the circumstances under which aforesaid flats have been allotted but nothing substantial was filed to controvert what has been stated by the petitioner except that meticulous calculations were taken into consideration According to the <ORG> the revision in land rate was well considered policy decision and there is nothing arbitrary or illegal about the same It is not for us in normal course to go through the policy regarding fixation of land rate or land premium but in the instant case fixation of land rate by the <ORG> is so arbitrary and without any basis that we have to discuss this in detail This also finds corroboration from page of the paper book where in relation to ground floor flat in Jahangirpuri the land rate has been shown at the rate of Rs We fail to understand that when initially the <ORG> in the brochure has estimated cost to be worked out as Rs for MIG category this estimated cost obviously had taken into account all possible items of expenses including the land which had been acquired cost of construction and other administrative expenses No material whatsoever in spite of our insistence as to what were the factors which were taken into consideration by Lt That will make mockery of law Secondly even though the construction of the flats may have been delayed on account of disputes between the respondent and the contractor but the amounts so spent on account of delay of construction was totally not passed on to the petitioners Thirdly according to the learned counsel for the respondent no allottee could claim that he has an entitlement to a particular set of land rate which was prevailing at different times We are afraid that this proposition cannot be of any help to the respondent as in that case the challenge was to a surcharge levied by the <ORG> as part of purchase price of the flat and petitioners before <ORG> were already allotted flats and <ORG> observed in that case that the real purpose of the petitioners to file the petition before <ORG> was to get back a part of the purchase price of the flats paid by the petitioners after flats have been secured by them Therefore <ORG> in paragraph thus observed Even if there may be any merit in this contention though there is none such a relief of refund cannot be the subject matter of a petition under Article Concerning for this submission that the authority has the trappings of a <ORG> or would be comprehended in other authority for the purpose of Article while determining price of flats constructed by it it acts purely in its executive capacity and is bound by the obligations which dealings of the <ORG> with the individual citizens import into every transaction entered into in the exercise of its constitutional powers But after the <ORG> or its agents have entered into the field of ordinary contract the relations are no longer governed by the constitutional provisions but by the legally valid contract which determines rights and obligations of the parties inter se or of any other constitutional provision when the <ORG> or its agents purporting to act within this field perform any act In this sphere they can only claim rights conferred upon them by contract and are bound by the terms of the contract only unless some statute steps in and confers some special statutory power or obligation on the <ORG> in the contractual field which is apart from contract Petitioners were under no obligation to seek allotment of flats even after they had registered themselves They looked at the price and flats and applied for the flats Each one of them was allotted a flat and he paid the price voluntarily They are now trying to wriggle out by an invidious method so as to get back a part of the purchase price not offering to return the benefit under the contract namely surrender of flat possession of the fiat is taken and price is paid At a later stage when they are secure in possession with title petitioners are trying to get back a part of the purchase price and thus trying to reopen and wriggle out of a concluded contract only partially has observed that those who contract with open eyes must accept the burdens of the contract along with its benefits Reciprocal rights and obligations arising out of contract do not depend for their enforceability upon whether a contracting party findings its prudent to abide by the terms of the contract By such a test no contract would ever have a binding force However as the petitions were heard on merits the contentions canvassed on behalf of the petitioners may as well be examined What is forbidden by Art is discrimination amongst persons of the same class and for the purposes of allotment of flats scheme wise allottees of flats in the same scheme not different schemes in the same income bricket will have each such class there is unequal treatment or unreasonable or arbitrary treatment the complaint that Art According to the petitioners before <ORG> there was another scheme of MIG fiats Munirka where allotment took place at and about the same time where no surcharge was levied These authorities do not help the case of the respondents as <ORG> was considering the validity of notification dated regarding prices fixed for various grades of sugar with reference to geographical cum agro econo mic consideration and average cost profiles of factories located in respective zones <ORG> further laid down that judicial function is exhausted when there is found to be a rational basis for conclusions reached by concerned authority From the aforesaid observations in <ORG> case supra it is dear that the scope of judicial review in cases like the present one relating to fixation of price is limited but as stated earlier it would be only when it is found that there is a rational basis for the conclusion reached by <ORG> for fixation of price as has been done in the instant case in our opinion the respondent authority had no basis for arriving at the rates fixed what to talk of rational basis In this case <ORG> was dealing with case of fixation of price under the Essential Commodities Act where the ultimate interest of the consumers was the primary consideration for upholding the order of fixation of prices of essential commodities Learned counsel for the petitioners also cited <ORG> <ORG> All ER and House of Lord Cases in support of his proposition This authority is of no help to the case of the respondent as <ORG> was examining altogether different issue involved in the matter The petitioner has entered into a contract with <ORG> being fully aware of the terms and conditions of the contract Before dealing with <ORG> case we would like to mention the brief facts of <NAME> case in this regard No assurance was given to any registrants that he will be allotted a flat on hire purchase basis The learned Counsel overlooked the fact that <ORG> for short <ORG> dealt with cases where allottees after voluntarily accepting the conditions imposed by the <ORG> have entered into the realm of contract purely and simple with the <ORG> and hence allottees could only claim the right conferred upon them by the said contract and was bound by the terms of the contract In the <ORG> case the note given in the brochure clearly stated that the cost shown therein is only an estimated cost and would increase or decrease in the price only at the time of completion of the house flat Many persons got themselves registered for allotment of flats houses It was in these circumstances that <ORG> held that it was in the realm of contract pure and simple more so the petitioner before <ORG> was highly educated and has accepted the revised terms of the <ORG> therefore and he was not entitled to any relief as the contract entered into between the <ORG> and the persons aggrieved was non statutory and purely contractual and therefore the rights were governed only by the terms of the contract No notice was issued to the petitioners informing them of the revision of prices no acceptance was asked for by the <ORG> from the petitioners as was done in the case of <ORG> rather nothing has been brought on record by <ORG> as to how this land rate land premium has been raised from to from Rs How this revision of rales which adversely affected their rights could be notified at their back without petitioners having any say Are courts so powerless under Article of the Constitution that when such a mischief so apparent is committed under the statutory powers that the citizen can be non suited on the pretext that it falls in the realm of contractual obligations and this <ORG> under Article of the Constitution is a silent spectator There is no other authority whether public or private which is authorised in the law to sell or dispose of land whereas in Uttar Pradesh the land does not belong to any single authority like <ORG> Even in Bareilly there are other authorities individuals owning lands for residential agricultural and commercial purposes They could not have applied in any other scheme of allotment nor could have purchased any other flat and today they are in a situation that initially a flat which was costing to them Rs If this is accepted then that would be perpetuating illegalities and same cannot be sustained in the eye of law We are of the opinion that the question involved in that case is not a similar to the one raised before us The statute and the regulations lay down the modalities by which the <ORG> can dispose of properties by way of sale or hire There is nothing in the regulations that compels the <ORG> to provide houses free of cost or at concessional rates or even at the cost of construction It is open to the <ORG> to fix such price for the flats as it may deem fit For example if the <ORG> does not fix a price or the principles for its determination or if properties are sought to be allotted otherwise than the lots when there are more claimants than houses or plots or there is arbitrariness in allotment the action of the <ORG> can be challenged in a writ petition Now we reach the contractual stage in the domain of private law Here any action by any one or more of the allottees to enforce the terms of the contract or to complain of their breach on the part of the <ORG> will lie at general law by way of a suit and not by way of a writ petition AH that be said is that the <ORG> agreed originally to give the flats at cost but now they refuse to do so and demand a higher price So in our opinion where the <ORG> revises the earlier policy of price fixation and substitutes a new one it is truely interfering with a step in the statutory stage amenable to writ jurisdiction and a writ petition cannot be dismissed as not maintainable merely on the ground that the result of the action also results in a breach of the original contract for which remedy is available in the ordinary civil <ORG>s Looked at in the proper perspective this is a case where the grievance of the petitioners falls under the second category of cases referred to in <NAME> case When the petitioners applied for registration under the Scheme in they had a reasonable as well as legitimate expectation that they will be allotted the flats within a span of reasonable time Having come to the conclusion that the revision of land premium is irrational arbitrary and unreasonable the next question we have to answer is as to what should be the cost which should be paid by the petitioners to the <ORG> <ORG> has not produced before us the cost of the individual flat worked out by them though they have given some details according to them of the total expenditures incurred by the <ORG> We feel it is not proper for us to go into this aspect of costing in this writ petition Accordingly we issue mandamus directing the <ORG> to handover possession of the flats to the petitioners on their making payment at the rate of Rupees for MIG flat Rs The demand letters issued earlier are set aside and fresh demand letters shall be issued to the petitioners who shall make payment in terms of the demand calculated on the basis of the price above mentioned The Expert Committee will take the actual cost of construction spent by the <ORG> on construction of the said flats If <ORG> after working out the cost on the basis of aforesaid works out cost to be more than the price that has been provisionally fixed by us the <ORG> shall give such revise cost and its intimation to the petitioners who within one month from the date of intimation shall pay the same to <ORG>
