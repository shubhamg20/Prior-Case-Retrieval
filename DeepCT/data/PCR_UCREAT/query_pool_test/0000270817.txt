The plaintiffs have now filed the suit out of which this second appeal arises praying for two reliefs vis for declaring that the plaint schedule offices rights and perquisites lapse by survivorship to the plaintiffs and the defendants and on the death of the said Vedavyasa <NAME> on th November and as a consequential relief for directing a the first and second defendants to enjoy the plaint schedule offices rights and perquisites with the plaintiffs in equal moities by turns or in any other manner the Court may deem fit to order giving necessary directions therefor to the first second and third defendants Both the Courts have dismissed the suit holding that the arrangement entered into in and were binding on the parties in virtue of which the first defendant is entitled to enjoy the share of <ORG> in preference to the plaintiff Mr <NAME> on their behalf has raised three contentions One on a question of fact and two on questions of law namely the office of Dharmakarthaship was in fact kept undivided and plaintiffs have succeeded to the share of <NAME> by right of survivorship along with defendants and In the document of no doubt provision was made only for three years in regard to the dharmakarthaship but it was illustrative of the future order in which the property was to be enjoyed by the several branches and for a period of nearly half a century it was so enjoyed I may state at the outset that it is neither sound nor proper to think of such offices from the point of view of a bare trustee under English law at when speaking of a trustee of a temple their Lordships of the Privy Council observed It has also to be remembered that a trust in the sense in which the expression is used in English law is unknown to the Hindu system pure and simple in no case is the property conveyed to or vested in him nor is he a trustee in the English sense of the term at the institution of hereditary trusteeship is held to rest on the intention of the donor either expressed in the instrument of trust or to be presumed from the usage their Lordships of the Privy Council observed The unknown founder may be supposed to have established this species of corporation with the distinct object of securing the due performance of the worship and the due administration of the property by the instrumentality and at the discretion of four persons capable of deliberating and bound to deliberate together he may also have considered it essential that those four persons should be the heads of particular families resident in a particular district open to the public opinion of that district and having that sort of family interest in the maintenance of this religious worship which would insure its due performance The <ORG> in dealing with these hereditary and charitable offices have always kept two considerations in view the intention of the founder must be given effect to and should not be frustrated the interests of the trust are paramount and any thing injurious to the interests of the trust cannot be countenanced No doubt these observations were made with reference to a religious office but it has also been extended to the case of a bare dharmakarthaship without any emoluments attached thereto In such a case where the office vests by descent in a number of persons in order to avoid confusion or an unseemly scramble it is not unusual and it is certainly not improper for the parties interested to arrange among themselves for the due execution of the functions belonging to the office in turn or in some settled order and sequence There is no breach of trust in such an arrangement nor any improper delegation of the duties of a trustee Thus it will be seen that the principle of partition is permitted on the ground that the usage which sanctions it is wholesome for the efficient and smooth discharge of the duties of the office where the office being hereditary in the family devolves on a number of co trustees <NAME> in the very same case observes The usage and custom generally is that along with other properties the office also is divided in the sense that the office is agreed to be held and the duties thereof discharged in rotation by each member or branch of the family the duration of their turns being in proportion to their shares in the family property In the case of religious offices with emoluments attached thereto usage has always been to permit partition and heritability in the various branches according to the laws of inheritance applicable to private property but should such a principle also be extended to the case of a trusteeship where there are no emoluments attached thereto In <NAME> <NAME> I A I Mad where a widow of a divided member of a family was allowed to succeed to the management of a charity in thatKattalai in a temple His Lordship Chief Justice Wallis made the following observation It was next argued by Mr <NAME> that as the plaintiff is now the only male member in the junior branch he is entitled to the right to the exclusion of the females However much one may wish that such a rule of law should obtain in regard to the management of trusts we are of opinion that the course of decisions in this <ORG> which has the sanction of <ORG> is opposed to this principle Sir <NAME> pointed out that the right of trusteeship in a public institution possessed by the members of a family when it is hereditary descends in the same manner as the right to the enjoyment of ordinary family property <NAME> in dealing with the doctrine of reverter of an office of a trustee to the natural heirs of a founder observes that where a founder of a charity does not appoint another person to manage the properties so given or settle a scheme for such management as he is entitled to do at the time of the endowment and as a part of the same transaction the natural presumption or the legal inference is that he intends to manage the property himself on behalf of the charity or reserves the management to himself Such management may pass to his heirs by inheritance just as a legal estate of inheritance may pass in England that the vesting of the management in accordance with rules of inheritance applicable to private property must from the very nature of the right be subject to the condition that the devolution in the ordinary line of descent is not inconsistent with or opposed to the purpose the founder had in view in establishing the worship Once it is recognised that the office of trustee is property to which the rules of inheritance governing ordinary property are applicable and it has been applied where the office has vested in a single person on principle the same rule must govern the devolution of the turn of office which has become vested on division between the various members of the family Mr <NAME> relied on a number of decisions in support of his contention that this principle should not apply to the case of a bare trusteeship Further their Lordships did not decide the question and the actual decision was rested on the facts peculiar to the foundation in question Sir <NAME> observed It is unnecessary however to decide whether there is a general rule for the devolution of the management of charities of this class because in their Lordships view there is sufficient indication in the documents and surrounding circumstances of this case that a devolution of the management to the heirs of the original donee is inconsistent with the purposes of the founder when he created the endowments The decision while it lays down that a renunciation or a waiver of a trust should not be permitted enunciates the following principle If it was a mere arrangement for the more convenient management of the choultry reserving to the plaintiff brothers their right of control and if necesssary of resumption of actual management then it might be said that there would be no interference with the supposed will of the founder and that the arrangement would be lawful To that extent it seems clear that any co parcener jointly entitled to management may waive his rights In every case of partition where several branches enjoy the office by turns there is no surrender or renunciation It is always subject to the implied condition that the resumption of actual management can be availed of either by consent of parties or through <ORG> and there is no question of divesting themselves of all control over the offices at If he a member has any ground for attacking the management of the temple or the administration of the property attached to it the <ORG>s are open is itself an authority for the proposition that a family arrangement or a partition entered into by the several branches of the family must be given effect to so long as the interests of the trust are not imperilled In this case the members of the family have acted upon the arrangement for nearly half a century and there is no reason why the arrangement should not be held binding on the representatives of the various branches observed that the arrangement will be binding upon the parties thereto and their representatives till modified either by common consent or in some manner known to law The first defendant is therefore entitled to enjoy the turn of office of <ORG> as also the various religious offices which fell to the share of <ORG> in preference to the Plaintiffs
