They brought these suits for a declaration of their rights to maintenance at the rate of Rs They also claimed priority over the mortgage rights of certain mortgagees who were made parties to the suit and thus raised questions which need not now be considered as they are not pressed in these appeals The lower Court gave the plaintiffs a decree for Rs plaintiffs appeal on the ground that the amount awarded should not have been less than Rs Now it is urged that the appellants have by virtue of exhibits A and become creditors of the Estate and not mere maintenance holders that the agreements are binding on all the successors of the <NAME> who executed them and that there fore no less sum than what was agreed upon therein can now be given as maintenance Further it is argued that the compromise having been entered into as a settlement of certain claims to portions of the estate is binding on all who took part in it and their representatives and creates vested rights in favour of those whose rights are declared in it is proper and reasonable for the reasons given in paragraph of his judgment As for the other points now taken in the appeals it is noticeable that Exhibit A though purporting to have been executed in pursuance of the razinamah in No of contains terms very different from the compromise petition Exhibit For these reasons alone I consider that the Subordinate Judge had power to direct the st defendant to pay maintenance at a lower rate than Rs But as reliance is placed on the binding character of the registered documents under which it is claimed that plaintiffs and their male heirs have acquired a right to an hereditary annuity for all time I may observe that in so far as Exhibit A and provide that <NAME> and <NAME> and their male descendants have a vested right to recover the fixed allowances through the present <NAME> and after him through the rightful owners of the <NAME>i or their heirs assignees executors administrators trustees etc from the estate and its incomes by declaring a recurring charge on the Kalahasti estate these documents create a future interest in immoveable property in favour of persons unborn and thus impose a restraint upon alienation which is contrary to the principles of Hindu Law I would therefore dismiss these appeals with costs per mensem has filed a memorandum of objections claiming priority over the appellant right on the ground of his decree being prior in point of time to Exhibit which is dated th November In these suits it is unnecessary to determine questions of priority between the various maintenance holders inter se seeing that their right to receive maintenance rests in the first instance not on their decrees or agreements but on their relationship to the owner of the Zamindari of is for this reason dismissed with costs It was not contended nor could it be successfully contended that the maintenance formed such a charge on the Zamindari as would preclude the Zamindar for the time being from alienating portions of it for necessary purposes
