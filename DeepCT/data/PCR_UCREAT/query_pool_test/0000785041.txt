When the police party proceeded towards <NAME> house they saw two young men coming from the opposite side on a motorcycle <ORG> by order dated disposed of the petition with an observation that petitioners may file a criminal complaint in a competent court The petitioner published a notice in <ORG> dated that he had disowned his son <NAME> and was not responsible for his actions The petitioner sent an undated letter to this Court received on wherein he alleged that <NAME> In charge of <ORG> along with some <ORG> Officers came to his house on at about a to enquire about the whereabouts of his son <NAME> and that when he informed them that he was not aware of it they started beating him Thereafter the <ORG> took him his wife and two minor daughters forcibly to the <ORG> Post through the bazaar He also alleged that the <ORG> forced him to bring money for the vehicles to conduct raids to catch his son <NAME> and he was forced to accompany them on such raids and was put in wooden Shikanza at Tulvan Thana When he begged that he should be released he was informed that he was being taken for the raids on the instructions of <NAME> Jind and that without the permission of the he could not be released The Petitioner alleged that his friends and relatives who wanted to meet him when he was being illegally detained were not permitted to meet him and they were also tortured He prayed for a direction to the <ORG> to stop the atrocities and torture According to <ORG> on the SHO <ORG> Station Garhi along with other police officials visited the house of petitioner in search of <NAME> who had escaped from custody The petitioner filed an affidavit dated before this Court on alleging interrogation by <ORG> on and in regard to escape of his son <NAME> from <ORG> custody A further affidavit was filed by the petitioner on wherein he alleged that his younger son <NAME> was forcibly taken from his sister house on and tortured This brought forth a further affidavit dated from the <NAME> by way of reply denying the allegations Not being satisfied with the reply affidavit filed on behalf of the <ORG> in regard to the letter petition this Court on directed the Chief Secretary of the <ORG> of Haryana to file a detailed affidavit in regard to the steps taken on the allegations made by the petitioner He submitted a report dated stating that the allegations of the petitioner relating to police torture illegal detention harassment to wife and daughters and removal of cash licensed weapon jewellery were not substantiated Not being satisfied with the said report this Court on directed the <ORG> to inquire into the matter with reference to the allegations made in the letter as also the subsequent affidavits filed by the petitioner and his relatives and the reply affidavits filed by the respondents The findings in the said report are arrived at on the basis of the allegations made in the affidavits filed before this Court and the statements made by the petitioner his family members and others nearly witnesses before the Inquiry Officer On this Court directed that the State Government to take appropriate action on the report of the <ORG> This Court also took note of the submission of the amicus curiae that in such cases apart from <ORG> inquiry and criminal prosecution compensation has to be awarded to the victims and the submission of the <ORG> that having regard to the facts of the case and having regard to the registration of the FIR the matter may have to await the result of the prosecution While adjourning the case this Court observed that the question of awarding any compensation at that stage did not arise The findings contained in the report of <ORG> are summarized below Allegations by Petitioner and his relatives Finding by I Note However in the writ petition filed by <NAME> and petitioner on in <ORG> it is alleged that petitioner and <NAME> were kept in illegal confinement from to and again from to There is no allegation of any torture at all The report further shows that petitioner was involved in several criminal cases from and his son <NAME> was involved in more number of criminal cases from the year as detailed below Cases in respect of petitioner No and above on and sentenced to undergo RI for six years and two years respectively Position emerging from the records CBI Report arguments A careful examination of the facts lead to the following inferences i All allegations relating to petitioner and his family members being taken to <ORG> Stations <ORG> Posts and being questioned beaten up tortured are in connection with the effort of <ORG> to find the whereabouts of <NAME> whenever he was involved in a serious incident that is a incident on when Joginder was suspected of killing a <ORG> constable incident on when Joginder escaped from <ORG> custody when he was being taken to court and incident on when Joginder was suspected of killing two persons at Tohana ii Though there is some evidence of illegal detention and beating of petitioner and his relatives the allegations of custodial torture are exaggerated and to a certain extent false iii There is no medical evidence nor any visible scars marks disability resulting from the alleged torture either in the case of petitioner or his family members relatives We will next refer to the factors which indicate that petitioner and his relatives have made false and exaggerated claims in regard to illegal detention torture etc But in the writ petition filed by petitioner and <NAME> in <ORG> on it is alleged that the petitioner and <NAME> were confined by <ORG> between and three days and again for a day between and But in the writ petition filed in <ORG> on by petitioner and <NAME> there is no allegation of beating or torture but only expression of an apprehension that they may be arrested harassed and tortured Note Petitioner blames his counsel for not mentioning the facts properly in the writ petition filed before <ORG> In the letter petition petitioner completely suppressed the fact that he along with <NAME> had filed a writ petition on in <ORG> in regard to the said incident between to and the fact that the said writ petition was disposed of on by <ORG> reserving liberty to file a criminal complaint He even published a notice in <ORG> in August stating that he has no connection with his son <NAME> In his affidavit dated filed in this case on petitioner reiterates that he has disowned his son <NAME> and alleges that he did not have any contact with him and that in spite of it the police were continuously harassing him and his family members seeking information about the whereabouts of <NAME> and raiding his house and his relatives houses to find out whether <NAME> was hiding there Petitioner was traveling to meet his son <NAME> whenever he was being produced in courts in respect of different cases In fact petitioner received money from <ORG> Tohana Kacchi Union of which he was a member to meet the expenses of the travel to meet his son on and Further the jail records showed that <NAME> was met by petitioner wife on petitioner brother <NAME> on and petitioner uncle <NAME> on and petitioner brother in law <NAME> on There was thus reasonable cause for the <ORG> to think that the family members of <NAME> might know about his whereabouts The report of the <ORG> shows that there is prima facie evidence about petitioner and some of his relatives being illegally detained in <ORG> Station Post and subjected possibly to some third degree methods to extract information regarding the whereabouts of <NAME> Singh This leads us to the question whether in addition to directing <ORG> inquiry and prosecution of the officers concerned on the facts and circumstances of this case compensation should be awarded to petitioner and his family members as a public law remedy for the violation of their fundamental rights under Article of the Constitution Though illegal detention and custodial torture were recognized as violations of the fundamental rights of life and liberty guaranteed under Article to begin with only the following reliefs were being granted in writ petitions under Article or a direction to set at liberty the person detained if the complaint was one of illegal detention direction to the concerned <ORG> to hold an inquiry and take action against the officers responsible for the violation In the Bhagalpur Blinding case <NAME> II vs State of Bihar SCC <NAME> as he then was speaking for the Bench posed the following question while considering the relief that could be given by a court for violation of constitutional rights guaranteed in Article of the Constitution but if life or personal liberty is violated otherwise than in accordance with such procedure is the Court helpless to grant relief to the person who has suffered such deprivation Why should the court not be prepared to forge new tools and devise new remedies for the purpose of vindicating the most precious of the precious fundamental right to life and personal liberty The question was expanded in a subsequent order in Bhagalpur Blinding case <NAME> IV vs State of Bihar SCC thus If an officer of the <ORG> acting in his official capacity threatens to deprive a person of his life or personal liberty without the authority of law can such person not approach the court for injuncting the <ORG> from acting through such officer in violation of his fundamental right under Article Can the <ORG> urge in defence in such a case that it is not infringing the fundamental right of the petitioner under Article because the officer who is threatening to do so is acting outside the law and therefore beyond the scope of his authority and hence the <ORG> is not responsible for his action Would this not make a mockery of Article and reduce it to nullity a mere rope of sand for on this view if the officer is acting according to law there would ex concessionis be no breach of Article and if he is acting without the authority of law the <ORG> would be able to contend that it is not responsible for his action and therefore there is no violation of Article So also if there is any threatened invasion by the <ORG> of the fundamental right guaranteed under Article the petitioner who is aggrieved can move the court under Article for a writ injuncting such threatened invasion and if there is any continuing action of the <ORG> which is violative of the fundamental right under Article the petitioner can approach the court under Article and ask for a writ striking down the continuance of such action but where the action taken by the <ORG> has already resulted in breach of the fundamental right under Article by deprivation of some limb of the petitioner would the petitioner have no remedy under Article for breach of the fundamental right guaranteed to him Would the court permit itself to become helpless spectator of the violation of the fundamental right of the petitioner by the <ORG> and tell the petitioner that though the Constitution has guaranteed the fundamental right to him and has also given him the fundamental right of moving the court for enforcement of his fundamental right the court cannot give him any relief Answering the said questions it was held that when a court trying the writ petition proceeds to inquire into the violation of any right to life or personal liberty while in police custody it does so not for the purpose of adjudicating upon the guilt of any particular officer with a view to punishing him but for the purpose of deciding whether the fundamental right of the petitioners under Article has been violated and the <ORG> is liable to pay compensation to them for such violation This <ORG> further clarified that in a given case if the investigation is still proceeding the <ORG> may even defer the inquiry before it until the investigation is completed or if the <ORG> considered it necessary in the interests of Justice it may postpone its inquiry until after the prosecution was terminated but that is a matter entirely for the exercise of the discretion of the <ORG> and there is no bar precluding the <ORG> from proceeding with the inquiry before it even if the investigation or prosecution is pending he was released from jail only on after years and sought compensation for his illegal detention This Court while recognizing that Article cannot be used as a substitute for the enforcement of rights and obligations which can be enforced efficaciously through the ordinary processes of courts civil and criminal raised for consideration the important question as to whether in the exercise of its jurisdiction under Article this Court can pass an order for payment of money as compensation for the deprivation of a fundamental right This Court answered the question thus while awarding compensation Article which guarantees the right to life and liberty will be denuded of its significant content if the power of this Court were limited to passing orders of release from illegal detention One of the telling ways in which the violation of that right can reasonably be prevented and due compliance with the mandate of Article secured is to mulct its violators in the payment of monetary compensation Administrative sclerosis leading to flagrant infringements of fundamental rights cannot be corrected by any other method open to the judiciary to adopt The right to compensation is some palliative for the unlawful acts of instrumentalities which act in the name of public interest and which present for their protection the powers of the <ORG> as a shield If civilisation is not to perish in this country as it has perished in some others too well known to suffer mention it is necessary to educate ourselves into accepting that respect for the rights of individuals is the true bastion of democracy Therefore the <ORG> must repair the damage done by its officers to the petitioner rights It may have recourse against those officers The next day his dead body was found on a railway track This Court awarded compensation to the mother of the deceased <NAME> as he then was spelt out the following principles Award of compensation in a proceeding under Article by this <ORG> or by the High <ORG> under Article of the Constitution is a remedy available in public law based on strict liability for contravention of fundamental rights to which the principle of sovereign immunity does not apply even though it may be available as a defence in private law in an action based on tort Enforcement of the constitutional right and grant of redress embraces award of compensation as part of the legal consequences of its contravention A claim in public law for compensation for contravention of human rights and fundamental freedoms the protection of which is guaranteed in the Constitution is an acknowledged remedy for enforcement and protection of such rights and such a claim based on strict liability made by resorting to a constitutional remedy provided for the enforcement of a fundamental right is distinct from and in addition to the remedy in private law for damages for the tort resulting from the contravention of the fundamental right It is this principle which justifies award of monetary compensation for contravention of fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution when that is the only practicable mode of redress available for the contravention made by the <ORG> or its servants in the purported exercise of their powers and enforcement of the fundamental right is claimed by resort to the remedy in public law under the Constitution by recourse to Articles and of the Constitution Emphasis supplied Dr A Anand as he then was in his concurring judgment elaborated the principle thus Convicts prisoners or under trials are not denuded of their fundamental rights under Article and it is only such restrictions as are permitted by law which can be imposed on the enjoyment of the fundamental rights by such persons It is an obligation of the <ORG> to ensure that there is no infringement of the indefeasible rights of a citizen to life except in accordance with law while the citizen is in its custody The public law proceedings serve a different purpose than the private law proceedings The purpose of public law is not only to civilize public power but also to assure the citizen that they live under a legal system which aims to protect their interests and preserve their rights Therefore when the court moulds the relief by granting compensation in proceedings under Article or seeking enforcement or protection of fundamental rights it does so under the public law by way of penalizing the wrongdoer and fixing the liability for the public wrong on the <ORG> which has failed in its public duty to protect the fundamental rights of the citizen The payment of compensation in such cases is not to be understood as it is generally understood in a civil action for damages under the private law but in the broader sense of providing relief by an order of making monetary amends under the public law for the wrong done due to breach of public duty of not protecting the fundamental rights of the citizen The compensation is in the nature of exemplary damages awarded against the wrongdoer for the breach of its public law duty and is independent of the rights available to the aggrieved party to claim compensation under the private law in an action based on tort through a suit instituted in a court of competent jurisdiction or and prosecute the offender under the penal law This Court held Custodial violence including torture and death in the lock ups strikes a blow at the Rule of Law which demands that the powers of the executive should not only be derived from law but also that the same should be limited by law It is aggravated by the fact that it is committed by persons who are supposed to be the protectors of the citizens It is committed under the shield of uniform and authority in the four walls of a police station or lock up the victim being totally helpless Any form of torture or cruel inhuman or degrading treatment would fall within the inhibition of Article of the Constitution whether it occurs during investigation interrogation or otherwise If the functionaries of the <ORG> become law breakers it is bound to breed contempt for law and would encourage lawlessness and every man would have the tendency to become law unto himself thereby leading to anarchy Does a citizen shed off his fundamental right to life the moment a policeman arrests him Can the right to life of a citizen be put in abeyance on his arrest Police is no doubt under a legal duty and has legitimate right to arrest a criminal and to interrogate him during the investigation of an offence but it must be remembered that the law does not permit use of third degree methods or torture of accused in custody during interrogation and investigation with a view to solve the crime End cannot justify the means By torturing a person and using third degree methods the police would be accomplishing behind the closed doors what the demands of our legal order forbid No society can permit it Award of such compensation by way of public law remedy will not come in the way of the aggrieved person claiming additional compensation in a civil court in enforcement of the private law remedy in tort nor come in the way of the criminal court ordering compensation under section of Code of Civil Procedure This takes us to the next question as to whether compensation should be awarded under Article for every violation of Article where illegal detention or custodial violence is alleged Whether compensation should be awarded for every violation of Article He can in that event seek remedial assistance under Article The power of the court to grant such remedial relief may include the power to award compensation in appropriate cases We are deliberately using the words in appropriate cases because we must make it clear that it is not in every case where there is a breach of a fundamental right committed by the violator that compensation would be awarded by the court in a petition under Article The infringement of the fundamental right must be gross and patent that is incontrovertible and ex facie glaring and either such infringement should be on a large scale affecting the fundamental rights of a large number of persons or it should appear unjust or unduly harsh or oppressive on account of their poverty or disability or socially or economically disadvantaged position to require the person or persons affected by such infringement to initiate and pursue act in the civil courts Ordinarily of course a petition under Article should not be used as a substitute for enforcement of the right to claim compensation for infringement of a fundamental right through the ordinary process of civil court emphasis supplied In Nilabati Behera supra this <ORG> put in a word of caution thus Of course relief in exercise of the power under Article or would be granted only when it is established that there has been an infringement of the fundamental rights of the citizen and no other form of appropriate redressal by the court in the facts and circumstances of the case is possible Law is in the process of development and the process necessitates developing separate public law procedures as also public law principles It may be necessary to identify the situations to which separate proceedings and principles apply and the courts have to act firmly but with certain amount of circumspection and self restraint lest proceedings under Article or are misused as a disguised substitute for civil action in private law This Court also drew attention to the following aspect There is one other aspect also which needs our consideration We are conscious of the fact that the police in India have to perform a difficult and delicate task particularly in view of the deteriorating law and order situation communal riots political turmoil student unrest terrorist activities and among others the increasing number of underworld and armed gangs and criminals Many hard core criminals like extremists the terrorists drug peddlers smugglers who have organized gangs have taken strong roots in the society It is being said in certain quarters that with more and more liberalization and enforcement of fundamental rights it would lead to difficulties in the detection of crimes committed by such categories of hardened criminals by soft peddling interrogation it is felt in those quarters that if we lay too much of emphasis on protection of their fundamental rights and human rights such criminals may go scot free without exposing any element or iota of criminality with the result the crime would go unpunished and in the ultimate analysis the society would suffer This is all the more so in view of the expectation of the society that police must deal with the criminals in an efficient and effective manner and bring to book those who are involved in the crime SCC this Court warned against non genuine claims But at the same time there seems to be a disturbing trend of increase in cases where false accusations of custodial torture are made trying to take advantage of the serious concern shown and the stern attitude reflected by the courts while dealing with custodial violence It needs to be carefully examined whether the allegations of custodial violence are genuine or are sham attempts to gain undeserved benefit masquerading as victims of custodial violence we have come to the conclusion that <NAME> and <NAME> had been illegally detained by respondents to from the afternoon of to the <ORG> must be held responsible for the unlawful acts of its officers and it must repair the damage done to the citizens by its officers for violating their indivisible fundamental right of personal liberty without any authority of law in an absolutely high handed manner We would have been therefore inclined to direct the <ORG> Government of Haryana to compensate <NAME> and <NAME> but since <NAME> has indulged in false hood in this Court and <NAME> has also exaggerated the incident by stating that on when he was way laid along with <NAME> and <NAME> Advocate two employees of respondents and were also present with the police party which version has not been found to be correct by the <ORG> they both have disentitled themselves from receiving any compensation as monetary amends for the wrong done by respondents to in detaining them We therefore do not direct the payment of any compensation to them Cases where violation of Article involving custodial death or torture is established or is incontrovertible stand on a different footing when compared to cases where such violation is doubtful or not established Where there is no independent evidence of custodial torture and where there is neither medical evidence about any injury or disability resulting from custodial torture nor any mark scar it may not be prudent to accept claims of human right violation by persons having criminal records in a routine manner for awarding compensation While custodial torture is not infrequent it should be borne in mind that every arrest and detention does not lead to custodial torture In cases where custodial death or custodial torture or other violation of the rights guaranteed under Article is established courts may award compensation in a proceeding under Article or However before awarding compensation the <ORG> will have to pose to itself the following questions a Whether the violation of Article is patent and incontrovertible whether the violation is gross and of a magnitude to shock the conscience of the court whether the custodial torture alleged has resulted in death or whether custodial torture is supported by medical report or visible marks or scars or disability Where there is no evidence of custodial torture of a person except his own statement and where such allegation is not supported by any medical report or other corroboration evidence or where there are clear indications that the allegations are false or exaggerated fully or in part courts may not award compensation as a public law remedy under Article or but relegate the aggrieved party to the traditional remedies by way of appropriate civil criminal action We should not however be understood as holding that harassment and custodial violence is not serious or worthy of consideration where there is no medical report or visible marks or independent evidence The exaggerated adherence to and insistence upon the establishment of proof beyond every reasonable doubt by the prosecution ignoring the ground realities the fact situations and the peculiar circumstances of a given case In the ultimate analysis the society suffers and a criminal gets encouraged Tortures in police custody which of late are on the increase receive encouragement by this type of an unrealistic approach of the <ORG> because it reinforces the belief in the mind of the police that no harm would come to them if an odd prisoner dies in the lock up because there would hardly be any evidence available to the prosecution to directly implicate them with the torture Unfortunately police in the country have given room for an impression in the minds of public that whenever there is a crime investigation usually means rounding up all persons concerned say all servants in the event of a theft in the employer house or all acquaintances of the deceased in the event of a murder and subjecting them to third degree interrogation in the hope that someone will spill the beans Police are branded as inefficient even when there is a short delay in catching the culprits in serious crimes Effort should be made to remove the very causes which lead to custodial violence so as to prevent such occurances An independent investigating agency preferably the respective <ORG> or <ORG> may be entrusted with adequate power to investigate complaints of custodial violence against Police personnel and take stern and speedy action followed by prosecution wherever necessary In this case there is no clear or incontrovertible evidence about custodial torture nor any medical report of any injury or disability The law will have to take own course This order will not come in the way of any civil court awarding compensation in an action in tort or the criminal court awarding compensation under section CPC in the pending prosecution against any of the officers if the charges are established We record our appreciation for the effort put in by <NAME> Amicus Curiae in presenting the matter
