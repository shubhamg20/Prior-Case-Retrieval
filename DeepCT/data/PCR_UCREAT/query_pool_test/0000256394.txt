The petitioners have been convicted of an offence punishable under Section Penal Code for disobeying an order made by the Sub divisional Magistrate of Barrackpore under Section Criminal The facts which give rise to the prosecution are briefly as follows It is said that communal tension had been aroused in the locality in connexion with a strike After setting out the matters which gave him jurisdiction the Sub divisional Magistrate passed an order under Section Altogether that order contained three directions and the petitioners are alleged to have dis He went to the spot with some police and found petitioner addressing a crowd That there is no evidence to show that the petitioners had any knowledge of it The first ground is based upon Clause of Section Criminal which is in these terms An order under this Section may be directed to a particular individual or to the public generally when frequenting or visiting a particular place This particular order was addressed to the public when visiting any part of the Barrackpore sub division In my opinion it is necessary to distinguish carefully between the jurisdiction of the Magistrate to make an order and a possible practical difficulty in showing that it has been disobeyed It does not follow that because it is difficult for the <ORG> to secure a conviction that the order itself was made without jurisdiction If we apply the test laid down by the learned Judges in those two Bombay cases it would be very difficult to say where a place ends and an area begins Nor is the matter of much practical importance for example if an area may be said to contain places She Magistrate could pass orders in identical terms and the result would be exactly the same In our opinion the order is a definite order and it does not contravene the provisions of Section On the second point the learned Deputy Legal Remembrancer conceded that he had no evidence apart from the evidence relating to what took place at the actual meeting the Town Inspector corroborates this account of the action taken by the officer in charge of the <ORG> and adds that petitioner and five other persons were addressing the meeting at the time From this evidence it is abundantly clear that no personal communication was made to any of the petitioners There is no distinct evidence as to the relative positions of the petitioners and the <ORG> officer in the crowd From the evidence it appears that the petitioner <NAME> did nothing more than behave like a Hyde Park orator Before it can be said that the petitioners had knowledge of the order it must be shown that its terms were communicated to them We must accordingly accept the contention raised in the second ground that there is no evidence upon which it can be held that the petitioners had any knowledge of the order The rule is accordingly made absolute the convictions and sentences are set aside and the petitioners are discharged from their bail
