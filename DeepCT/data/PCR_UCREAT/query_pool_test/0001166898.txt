A No of This is an appeal by the plaintiff against the judgment and order in I A No of in No of on the file of <ORG> of Devakottah setting aside an award No of is a suit for partition instituted by the appellant against his brother defendant and his sons defendants to The parties belong to <NAME> community and the family is an affluent one having extensive money lending business in Burma On the plaintiff sent a notice to defendant calling upon him to effect a division and to render accounts The demand not having been complied with the plaintiff instituted the present suit for partition on According to the plaint the assets of the family consisted of immovable properties in British India and Pudukottai being items to and item No respectively in schedule A to the plaint of jewels and moveables described in schedule and two money lending firms at Minla and Sitkwin in Burma mentioned in schedules and It was further alleged in the plaint that <NAME> the father of the plaintiff and defendant had entered large amounts belonging to the joint family in the names of the members of the family male and female in what are called the Thanathu maral accounts that these amounts were invested in various firms or with individuals and that those investments would come to about lakhs This was the subject of schedule to the plaint and the plaintiff claimed a half share therein It may be noted that the assets mentioned in schedules and included also immoveable properties in Burma As regards the jewels and moveables mentioned in schedule the defendants contended that it contained several items not belonging to the family and not in existence and a list of the articles which were available for division was set out in Schedule There was a further plea that some of the jewels mentioned in the plaint belonged to the several defendants to the wife of defendant and to his daughters <NAME> and <NAME> as their own and that they were therefore not liable for partition With reference to the Thanathu maral accounts the defendants set out in some detail the history of the amounts and their investments in para of the written statement and it was admitted that these amounts belonged to the family in whosoever name the investments might stand and it was added that the true value of these assets would not be lakhs as mentioned in the plaint but only lakhs including lands purchased in Burma and of the value of lakhs Defendants denied that there was any manipulation of accounts or misappropriation of amounts and contended that accounts should be taken only of the assets as they stood on the date of the partition They also pleaded that the court had no jurisdiction to divide the immoveable properties situate in Burma The nd defendant who was a major filed a written statement putting the plaintiff to strict proof of the allegations in the plaint and otherwise adopting the written statement of defendant The plaintiff pleaded that there was a custom in the Nattukottai Chettiar community for a member of the joint family setting up separate family after marriage that monies drawn by him thereafter would be entered in a separate account called Pathuvazhi that at the time of the partition the amounts appearing in the Pathuvazhi account would be debited against the member and that in accordance with this custom the amounts shown in the Pathuvazhi account of defendant should be debited against his share On those pleadings issues were framed on and the suit was posted for trial on It was then referred to arbitration on but that proved abortive and the suit was posted peremptorily for trial on and the hearing actually commenced on Meantime defendant filed on an application under Order Rule for leave to file additional written statement Therein defendant alleged that the deceased <NAME> the father of the plaintiff and defendant herein set apart on two sums Of money of Rs This application was opposed by the plaintiff on the ground that these allegations were inconsistent with the admissions in the written statement that all monies standing in the <NAME> accounts were joint family properties available for division that the petition was belated and not bona fide and that the real object of the defendants was merely to drag on the proceedings On the Subordinate Judge dismissed this application on the ground that it sought to raise a new and inconsistent plea and that it was really inspired by defendant The Subordinate Judge held that the claim of defendant for remuneration for management based upon the practice of the community was not well founded that the custom pleaded by the plaintiff that amounts drawn by members of the joint family and entered in Pathuvazhi accounts should be debited against them was also not established that on the question of the jewels available for partition the commissioner should determine whether the gifts in favour of the several members pleaded by the defendants were true and were reasonable that the payment of seer murais was not legal but a moral obligation and that no provision need be made therefor at the division that items and had not been dedicated to charity and were available for division and that defendant was liable to account only for the assets existing on the date of the division but that accounts should be taken on the principles applicable to accounting by managers of joint Hindu families and that provision should also be made for a proper scheme for the management of the family charities It was also held on issue No that the Court had no jurisdiction to direct a division of immoveable properties not situated in British India Against this judgment appeals were preferred to this Court by all the parties A No of by defendant On this petition an order was passed on that there was no need to stay all proceedings in No of and that it was sufficient if the passing of the final decree alone was stayed The result then was that the stage had been set for an enquiry being proceeded with before the Commissioner and for defendant rendering accounts before him At this stage the parties entered into an agreement that the disputes in the suit should be settled by arbitration and that a sum of Rs lakhs should be paid to the plaintiff on account There was also a petition under Order Rule that the <ORG> might grant leave to refer the matters to arbitration on behalf of the minor defendants to as it was beneficial to them On the <ORG> passed an order that all matters in dispute in this suit and all matters and proceedings connected therewith be referred to the arbitration of <NAME> of Kandanur and <NAME> of Kothamangalam It is staled therein that all the parties have agreed to the award and signed it in token of their acceptance The final award which is an amplification of the interim award was made on filed into <ORG> on that date They complained that the agreement dated to refer to arbitration was brought about by coercion and undue influence that there was no proper enquiry that the arbitrators were partial and biassed and that the award was unjust The validity of the award was also attacked on two grounds which requires special mention One was based on the fact that the joint family owned immoveable properties in Burma and on the principle of private international law that <ORG>s in one country would have no jurisdiction to adjudicate on title to immoveable property situated in a foreign country or to direct their division It was urged that as the reference to arbitration comprised all the matters in dispute in the suit and as division of the immoveable properties in Burma was prayed for in the plaint the reference comprehended a subject over which the <ORG> had no jurisdiction and that therefore it was illegal and that in consequence the award was void The plaintiff opposed this application He pleaded that there was proper enquiry and that the charges of misconduct were unfounded He accordingly prayed that a decree might be passed in terms of the award At the hearing of this petition no oral evidence was tendered by the defendants The Subordinate Judge held that there was no basis for the charges of misconduct levelled against the arbitrators that there was due and proper enquiry and that the award was not open to objection on the merits but he agreed with the defendants that the reference to matters in dispute in the suit comprised also questions relating to immoveable properties in Burma and that it was without jurisdiction and that it also included the dispute relating to the sums of Rs In this <ORG> apart from supporting the judgment of the <ORG> below on the two grounds aforesaid Mr <NAME> the learned counsel for the respondents raised a further contention that under Section Arbitration Act the power of the <ORG> to refer matters in a suit to arbitration could be exercised only so long as judgment has not been delivered and that where judgment has been pronounced as it was in this case on that power comes to an end and there is no jurisdiction in the <ORG> thereafter to refer the dispute to arbitration and that therefore the reference dated is without jurisdiction It was also argued that even if this contention is to be held to be too wide the reference to arbitration should at any rate be limited to matters still remaining to be decided and could not include what had been already decided by the <ORG> and as the reference on was not so limited it was illegal and so was the award passed thereon As a branch of the same argument it was contended that <ORG> before which the appeals against the preliminary decree were pending has seisin of the cause that that <ORG> alone had power to refer to arbitration and that the reference by the Subordinate Judge was without jurisdiction The judgment of the lower <ORG> was also sought to be supported on the ground that the agreement to refer to arbitration was obtained by coercion that there was no proper enquiry by the arbitrators and that the award was liable to be set aside on the merits On these contentions four questions arise for determination Is the reference bad on the ground that it involved the determination of title to immovable properties situated in foreign jurisdiction Is the reference bad on the ground that the Subordinate Judge had lost the power to refer matters in dispute to arbitration by reason of judgment having been delivered on or on the ground that the reference comprehended matters which had been decided by the preliminary judgment or that the Court had no jurisdiction by reason of the appeals against the preliminary judgment having been pending in <ORG> and Is the award vitiated by any misconduct or irregularity We shall deal with the above questions in the order mentioned above The first proposition is that the <ORG> have no jurisdiction to determine questions of title to immoveable properties in foreign countries or to effect a division thereof In Nachiappa Muthukaruppan AIR Mad A this Court had occasion to consider this question elaborately and the substance of the decision is correctly set out in the headnote which runs as follows Neither under Section nor under the rules of private international law has a <ORG> jurisdiction to entertain a suit for partition of immoveable properties situate outside British India for instance in Ceylon especially where the partible nature of such properties is disputed It has no jurisdiction even to declare that the said properties are partible joint family properties Nor has it power to take such properties into its calculation in adjusting the equities between the parties Rule Subject to the exceptions hereinafter mentioned the <ORG> has no jurisdiction to entertain an action for the determination of the title to or the right to the possession of any immoveable property situate out of England foreign land or the recovery of damages for trespass to such immoveable There are three exceptions to this rule Whore there is a contract or an equity between the parties with reference to immoveable property where the action is one for the administration of an estate or trust and where the action is for enforcing a maritime lien on a ship or for damage done to an immoveable property situate out of England The learned advocate for the appellants does not contend that <ORG> would have jurisdiction either to decide the question of disputed title with reference to foreign immoveable property or to direct division thereof The second proposition is that a <ORG> which has no jurisdiction to determine any matter in controversy in a suit has no jurisdiction to refer it for determination by arbitrators This stands to reason because the award becomes effective only when a decree is passed thereon and as the <ORG> is bound to pass a decree in terms of the award when it is not open to any objection to recognise a power to refer the dispute relating to foreign immoveables to arbitration would be to assume jurisdiction to pass a decree with reference to such properties It was held that the subject matter of the award must be wholly within the jurisdiction of the <ORG> where it is sought to be filed and as a portion thereof was in Travancore the sub <ORG> at Palghat had no jurisdiction to entertain the application That no doubt was a case of an award pronounced in an arbitration without the intervention of the <ORG> whereas in the present case the reference is by <ORG> in a pending action but on principle this cannot make a difference because the award in either case would become valid only when a decree of the <ORG> is passed thereon notice is given to the other parties to the arbitration and under para Upon judgment so pronounced a decree shall follow and no appeal shall lie from such decree except in so far as the decree is in excess of or not in accordance with the award Has the <ORG> in British India jurisdiction to pass such a decree Prima facie not The third proposition of law is that where the reference is invalid in part it is invalid in toto and the award based on such a reference cannot be split up into two parts and upheld in so far as it relates to what could be validly referred and rejected only as regards what could not be In such a case the award must fail in its entirety After quoting the observations of <ORG> as he then was that the arbitration cannot at the same time relate to matters within the jurisdiction of the <ORG> and matters without jurisdiction Lord <NAME> observed as follows Their Lordships desire to reserve their opinion upon the question whether there may not be exceptions to that comprehensive statement His contention is that all these propositions of law have no application to the facts of the present case because there was no dispute about title to immoveable properties in Burma and there was no claim for their partition at the date of reference to arbitration It has already been mentioned that the title of the plaintiff to a half share in the Burma assets including immoveable properties was unequivocally admitted by the defendants in their written statement and therefore there was no question of title in dispute to be adjudicated by the <ORG>s It runs as follows Whether this <ORG> has jurisdiction to divide immoveable properties of the joint family in Burma The Court held by its judgment dated that it had no jurisdiction Against the preliminary decree the plaintiff filed A No of but in the appeal he did not challenge the correctness of the finding on issue It involved no adjudication of title to foreign immoveable properties nor was there any subsisting prayer for division thereof We are therefore of opinion that the reference cannot be held to be illegal on the grounds urged by the respondent It is next contended that apart from the reference the award settled questions of title to immovable properties in Burma and that it was therefore void Paragraph runs as follows After communications are restored to Burma the plaintiff and the defendants have to divide the firms in Burma at the places Minhla and Sitquin belonging to them and the lands godowns homes gardens and other properties items bank deposits jewels moveables all assets etc It is argued on behalf of the respondents that the award purports to give a half shape each to the plaintiff and to the defendants in all the Burma assets including the amounts entered in the <NAME> account of the plaintiff and defendant and their accretions that these assets included also immoveable properties that I A No of raised the question of the divisibility of these assets and though it was rejected on by the Subordinate Judge it was pending decision in A No of in <ORG> and that therefore the question of title to the immoveable property in Burma was in dispute at the date of the reference The pleadings in the suit contain an admission of the plaintiff title to these assets and unless and until the additional written statement of defendant is ordered to be received there was no dispute in the suit with reference to foreign immoveables The fact that the order in I A No of was challenged in appeal has not the effect of altering or enlarging the scope of the suit so as to comprehend a dispute in respect of title to foreign immoveables There is therefore no force in this objection It is further contended that under the terms of the award the title of the plaintiff as well as that of the defendants to a half share in the foreign assets including immoveables has been recognised and declared that such a decision has a force and operation independent of the admissions of the parties on which it is based that unlike admissions the effect of the declaration is to conclude the rights of the parties and that therefore it is hit by the rule of private international law that there is no jurisdiction to declare title to foreign immoveable properties But it is only a declaration following upon adjudication by the <ORG> of disputed title to foreign immoveables that is beyond its jurisdiction and where there is no adjudication there is no declaration such as is prohibited by the principles of private international law The precise meaning of the word declare in that section has frequently come up for judicial consideration In Sakharam Krishnaji Madan Krishnaji Bom the question arose whether a deed which acknowledged that there had been a partition required registration under Section Registration Act on the ground that it declared the rights of the parties Holding that it did not come within Section <ORG> observed as follows It implies a declaration of will not a mere statement of fact and thus a deed of partition which causes a change of legal relation to the property divided amongst all the parties to it is a declaration in the intended sense but a letter containing an admission direct or inferential that a partition once took place does not declare a right within the meaning of the section It does in one sense declare a right that is the existence of the right is directly or indirectly stated by the writing but it is not the expression or declaration of will by which the right is constituted Though the word declare might be given a wider meaning they are satisfied that the view originally taken by West is right In <ORG> <NAME> AIR there was an award in respect of a claim of <ORG> under a mortgage deed and it provided that in default of payment of the amount due the amount might be realised through civil <ORG> by the sale of all the properties This award was made a rule of <ORG> and a decree was passed in terms thereof The decree was not registered and the question was raised in execution that as it declared rights to immoveable property it was not admissible under Section Registration Act It was held by <NAME> that the decree did not declare any right within the meaning of Section Registration Act and that it was admissible without registration Mr <NAME> argued that even if there was in the award an affirmation of title to foreign immoveable properties that was only incidental and that such incidental declarations are not opposed to any principle of private international law We may add that it was also suggested that the reference comprised not merely matters in difference in the suit but also all matters and proceedings connected therewith and that that went beyond the scope of the suit We shall now deal with the second question whether the reference to arbitration contravenes the order in No of That however does not bar the jurisdiction of the <ORG> to refer the matters to arbitration or the jurisdiction of the arbitrators to make an award There is nothing to prevent the parties themselves settling the matters by compromise notwithstanding this order and likewise there is nothing to prevent them from agreeing to have their disputes settled by arbitration That could be waived by them and they having expressly agreed to the reference on and again to the interim award on it is not open to them to raise any objection on this score which is in these terms Where in any suit all the parties interested agree that any matter in difference between them in the suit shall be referred to arbitration they may at any time before judgment is pronounced apply in writing to the <ORG> for an order of reference The argument for the respondents is that the <ORG> possess no inherent jurisdiction to refer disputes in pending actions to arbitration that it is a power which must be expressly conferred by statute that Section Arbitration Act is the enactment which confers such a power on the <ORG> that under the terms of that section the power to refer to arbitration can be exercised only at any time before judgment is pronounced that it cannot be exercised thereafter that in this case on the pronouncement of the judgment on the power of the Subordinate Judge to make a reference came to an end This position is sought to be reinforced by a reference to Section Arbitration Act which enacts that the <ORG> shall not deal with matters which have been referred to arbitration except in the manner and to the extent provided in the Act and this it is argued indicates that the matter is still capable of adjudication by the <ORG> and would be inappropriate at a stage when there has been a decision by the <ORG> It may be conceded that the power to refer to arbitration must he expressly conferred by statute In Abani Bhusan Hemchandra AIR Cal where the point for determination was whether an appellate Court had the power to refer disputes to arbitration there is the following observation in the judgment of <NAME> Whatever the proper view might be we are bound to apply the law as it stands and as the power of referring a case to arbitration is not one that is inherent in a <ORG> we must hold that in the absence of any express provision the appellate <ORG> is not competent to exercise it The question therefore is whether on the terms of Section the reference dated is intra vires of the powers of the <ORG> and that has to be decided on a construction of the language of Section in the light of well established principles That section provides that where in a suit all the parties agree that matters in difference in the suit shall be referred to arbitration that might be done at any time before judgment is pronounced What is the meaning of the word judgment in this context Judgment is defined in Section as the statement given by the Judge of the grounds of a decree or order and that is wide enough to cover judgments on applications for injunction appointment of a receiver and so forth and also judgments in the suit on such questions as court fees payable on the plaint To ascertain its true import we must turn to the language of the section itself Section contemplates that any matter in dispute in the suit can be referred to arbitration and therefore a judgment which bars the jurisdiction of the <ORG> to refer any matter to arbitration must be a judgment which does not leave any matter undecided In this context therefore it can only mean a judgment which finally decides all matters in controversy in the suit it does not mean an interlocutory judgment which still leaves any of the matters in dispute undecided Findings on issues though called judgments are not judgments in this sense nor are preliminary judgments even though they decide some of the matters finally because there are still matters to be decided in the suit For the purpose of Section Arbitration Act nothing is a judgment which does not put an end to the suit and so long as an action is pending there can be reference under that section It has been repeatedly held that the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code applicable to pending suits apply to suits in which there has been a preliminary but not a final decree In holding that the application was maintainable <ORG> observed as follows Their Lordships fully agree with the observation made by the learned Subordinate Judge who passed the final decree in his order of th May whereby he allowed the objections of the appellants to the Commissioner report on the ground that a partition suit in which a preliminary decree has been passed is still a pending suit and the rights of parties who are added after the preliminary decree have to be adjusted at the time of final decree The partition has not yet been made and until the partition has been made and the final decree pronounced it could not be said that any decree in terms of the last paragraph of Section has been passed in the case The order that is made and which was made in this case under the first paragraph of Section has no doubt the force of a decree but the question that we have to consider is whether the proceedings that are taken subsequent to such order being passed for the purpose of effecting a partition are proceedings in the suit itself or proceedings in execution of the decree The question has frequently come up as to whether Order Rule is applicable to adjustments made after the preliminary and before a final where a suit has been adjusted the <ORG> shall decree in a suit In <ORG> <ORG> AIR the question was raised whether an adjustment made after the preliminary decree in a mortgage suit came within Order Rule which provides that the adjustment of the decree should be certified and if not certified within time it could not be taken into account <ORG> held that the case was governed by Order Rule which applies to pending suits and not by Order Rule which applies to execution of decrees Admittedly the suit continues until the final decree is passed and there is no time for recording the agreement arrived at as there is under Order In <NAME> <NAME> AIR Pat which was also a case of an adjustment after the preliminary decree in a mortgage suit had been passed the following observations occur As I have already said it was conceded by Mr <NAME> that if Order Rule has no application the application is within the jurisdiction of the Subordinate Judge under Order Rule and in my opinion he was right in making that concession In applying Order Rule the <ORG> observed as follows This is a necessary corollary of the view taken by this Court that a preliminary decree does not terminate the suit which continues till a final decree is passed Once a suit is finally disposed of Order Rule cannot have any application but so long as the suit is pending it is open to the parties to enter into a compromise or otherwise adjust their differences The position being well established that the action is pending until a final decree is passed it follows that there is jurisdiction in the <ORG> to refer the matters in dispute to arbitration until the final judgment is pronounced Mr <NAME> contended that there were reasons of policy why the <ORG> should not have the power to refer matters in dispute to arbitration after a preliminary judgment is pronounced He relies on certain observations occurring in Juggeswur Das Kritartha Moyee Dossee Beng FB There the question was whether under the Civil Procedure Code Act of the appellate <ORG> had the power to refer disputes to arbitration Under Section of that Act the parties may apply to a <ORG> at any time before the final judgment for an order of reference <ORG> of the Calcutta High <ORG> held that the appellate <ORG> had no power under this section to refer disputes to arbitration The decision as such is not material to this case but the following observations occurring in the judgment of <ORG> are relied on for the respondents As pointed out by the Chief Justice if parties are allowed to refer matters to arbitration after a case has been finally disposed of by <ORG> such a proceeding might tend to bring the lower <ORG> into contempt That no doubt was a decision under Act of but the following observations occurring in that judgment are relevant for the purpose of this question The decision in Mad was followed in <NAME> <NAME> Cal and <NAME> <NAME> Cal and until the enactment of the Arbitration Act of the jurisdiction of the appellate <ORG> to refer disputes to arbitration was not disputed Thus it is impossible to discover any principle of public policy in negativing the power to refer matters which had been decided by a <ORG> to arbitration It is true that under the Arbitration Act there is authority for holding that the appellate <ORG> has no power to refer disputes to arbitration It would cause a revolution in the existing practice if it is to be held that there is no power in the <ORG> to refer such matters to arbitration Mr <NAME> the learned advocate for the appellant referred to a number of cases in which there was reference to arbitration after preliminary decree had been passed and he relied on them as supporting the position that the power to refer to arbitration could be exercised until the suit terminated by the passing of a final decree In the case in Cal already referred to there was a reference to arbitration in a partition suit after the preliminary decree and that was relied on as saving limitation The question that arose for determination was whether the appeal against that decree was competent In holding that the appeal did not lie <NAME> observed as follows It is next contended that the present ease did not fall within the second schedule of the Civil Procedure Code at all because this schedule is intended to apply to those cases only where a decree is based wholly upon the award of the arbitrators whereas in the present case the final decree is based partly upon a preliminary decree and partly upon the award of the arbitrators This contention must be negatived on the short ground that there is nothing in the Code to prevent the parties from referring the matter in difference between them to arbitration at any stage of the suit and that it is not quite correct to say that the final decree which has been passed in the suit is not wholly based upon the award of the arbitrators Thereafter under Section Ajmer Courts Regulation the case was referred to <ORG> and it was there pending At this stage the parties filed an application in tae <ORG> asking for a reference of the disputes to arbitration The question was whether there was a valid reference to arbitration The fallowing observations occurring at page are relied on by the learned counsel for the appellant as supporting his contention In our view the best analogy is that of a preliminary decree and a final decree and pending the final order of <ORG> On receiving the answers of <ORG> to the reference the suit was still to adopt the language of the arbitration schedule in the Civil Procedure Code pending judgment In our opinion in spite of the reference to <ORG> and not in any way because of the reference to <ORG> or because of anything which <ORG> said this was an arbitration in a suit in which the parties agreed that the matters between them should be referred to arbitration of Schedule II Civil they were at any time before judgment was pronounced at liberty to apply to the <ORG> which ordered the order of reference In their Lordships opinion there is no ground for impugning the validity of this award In Lalta Prasad Kedarnath AIR Oudh ZA the facts were that there was a preliminary decree in a partition suit and against that there was an appeal pending Then there was a compromise between the parties and the <ORG> of first instance passed a decree in terms thereof under Order Rule It was held that as the suit was pending in that <ORG> until a final decree was passed it had jurisdiction to pass the decree under Order Rule There is no reason why the same principle should not apply to references to arbitration It must therefore be held that the order of reference dated was within the jurisdiction of the Sub <ORG> and that the award could not be impeached on the ground that it was without jurisdiction It is next argued that in any event the reference should have been limited to the matters still remaining to be decided and that as it included all the matters in the suit including those already decided it was illegal It is contended on behalf of the appellant that the award is confined to the matters not decided by the preliminary decree that the decisions of the <ORG> that foreign immoveables could not be divided that defendant was not entitled to remuneration that no contribution need be made for Seer murais had all been adopted in the award and that the objection of the respondents had no foundation on the facts of the case and that therefore the question did not arise for decision Paragraph provides that A No of A No of and A No of should not be prosecuted and it also decides the question of costs in the appeals It cannot therefore be said that only those matters which were not decided by the preliminary decree were dealt with by award No authority has been cited in favour of such a contention Under that section all the matters in dispute in the suit could be referred to arbitration without any limit or qualification provided the three conditions mentioned there in are satisfied namely that the reference relates to matters in dispute in the suit that all the parties interested agree to the reference and the suit has not been disposed of by judgment which as already held by us must mean that the suit is pending There is no further limitation under the section that only those matters in dispute could be referred which have not been decided by the <ORG> Once the conditions laid down in the section are satisfied the jurisdiction of the <ORG> to refer the entire subject matter of the suit to arbitration is absolute and unqualified It is finally argued that as appeals against the preliminary decree were pending in <ORG> it was only that <ORG> that could refer the dispute to arbitration and that the Subordinate Judge had no jurisdiction to make the reference This contention again is not sought to be supported either by reference to the language of Section Arbitration Act or by any authority There is nothing in Section to limit the power of the <ORG> to refer matters to arbitration because of the pendency of an appeal so long as the action is pending in that <ORG> its jurisdiction to refer is complete It is contended that it would be inconvenient for two <ORG>s to have concurrent jurisdiction to refer the same matters to arbitration that it will result in a conflict of jurisdiction and that there might even be inconsistent awards But if it is a question of deciding which of two <ORG>s has the power to refer disputes to arbitration there is no reason why the choice should fall on the appellate <ORG> and not on the trial <ORG> It is contended that in respect of matters decided by the preliminary judgment the jurisdiction vests only with the appellate <ORG> and not with the <ORG> of first instance but it can equally be contended that in respect of matters not covered by the preliminary judgment the jurisdiction is exclusively vested in the trial <ORG> and not in the appellate <ORG> There the suit had been finally disposed of by the Subordinate Judge and an appeal against that decision was pending in the District <ORG> Then there was a reference to arbitration and the question was whether it was valid This observation could have no application when the suit itself has not been finally disposed of If anything it supports the position of the appellant When once it is conceded that the action is pending until it is finally disposed of by a final decree the <ORG> where it is pending has the power under Section Arbitration Act to refer the matters in dispute to arbitration It now remains to deal with the last objection of the respondents that the award is bad on the merits on account of coercion on the part of the plaintiff and misconduct of the arbitrators The respondents put forward five charge under this heading It was argued that defendant was not a free agent in consenting to the reference to the arbitration and that he signed Ex The only basis for the charge is that defendant had fixed the marriage of his daughter for that the plaintiff having obtained an order for the appointment of a Commissioner to take possession of papers in the possession of defendant on defendant consented to the arbitration with a view to avoid humiliation and disgrace There were also repeated extensions by the <ORG> of the time for the filing of the award by the arbitrators of the award that defendants and should pay Rs There is no basis for the contention that the plaintiff was not entitled to relief if misappropriation was established and the award of the arbitrators is therefore within their province and further this finding was embodied in para There is no substance in this objection The next objection is that the decision of the arbitrators on the question of jewels was opposed to the judgment in the suit which had declared that the Commissioner should decide whether the gifts of the jewels in favour of the several members of the family pleaded by the defendants was true and was binding on the plaintiff of the award the arbitrators state We have determined that all the jewels comprised in Schedules a and belong to the family in common and no one has any separate right to them This is within the directions given in the preliminary judgment There were some complaints about the valuation of the jewels but that is not a ground for setting aside the award It is provided therein that in respect of taxes payable by the family in Burma and in India the accounts had been taken till that date that if there is any refund of the taxes with reference to the prior period the plaintiff will be entitled to half share therein and if any further tax is payable for that period the defendants alone shall be liable to pay the same and that in respect of this obligation the defendants should execute an indemnity bond in favour of the plaintiff We agree with this finding The last objection raised by the defendants is with reference to the award of interest on the amount payable to the plaintiff from to The arbitrators state that they have settled the accounts as on and the award of interest from that date is within their authority The interests of defendant were not adverse to that of defendants to and there is no sound reason for holding that defendants to are not bound by the action of defendant The order of the lower Court is therefore set aside and this appeal is allowed and it is directed that a decree be passed in terms of the award On our finding that the award is valid and that a decree be passed in terms thereof it would be really unnecessary to discuss the questions arising in A No of A No of and of and Nos and of and A Nos and of and No of But as the matter is one which might be taken in appeal to <ORG> we have considered it desirable to hear all these appeals and record our findings thereon No of This is an appeal preferred by defendant in No of on the file of <ORG> Devakottah against the preliminary judgment and decree dated The facts leading up to this appeal have been set out in our judgment in A No of The only point that arises for decision in this appeal apart from the contention in A No of is about the correctness of the order in I A No of whereby the Subordinate Judge declined to receive the additional written statement sought to be filed by defendant After the suit had been pending long and had been posted peremptorily for trial defendant filed I A No of seeking to raise a new and inconsistent plea This is inconsistent with the admission made by defendant that those amounts with their accretions are divisible among all the members of the family and that the plaintiff is entitled to a half share therein The plaintiff opposed this application on the ground that it was inconsistent with the previous statement that it was belated and that it was defendant who was behind this application The only point for determination in this appeal is whether there is ground for permitting defendant to put forward his present case The additional written statement is open to the objection that it contains really no substantial plea and that it is sought to be filed only with the object of delaying the hearing of the suit He could have had no personal knowledge about this matter We are satisfied that there is no substance in the contentions sought to be raised in I A No of and that the Subordinate Judge has exercised a sound discretion in dismissing this application There is no other point in this appeal and it is accordingly dismissed with costs No of This is an appeal preferred by defendants and to against the preliminary decree in No of <ORG> Devakottai Four contentions were urged in this appeal The witnesses examined on the side of the plaintiff deny the existence of any such custom stated that he received some amount as remuneration for the management of a business under an agreement with his brother The next contention of the appellants relates to item No in schedule A There is a school which is being conducted at that place and the appellants want that this charity might be continued There is not even a plea in the written statement that this property had been dedicated to charity The contention raised in this appeal is again a question of custom of the reply statement filed by the plaintiff in these terms The plaintiff states that according to the usage and custom of the Nattukottai Chettiars the drawings made by or the expenses incurred on behalf of the individual members of the family after setting up separate family by such member are debited to his individual account so as to equalise the shares of the members of the family in the joint family properties and to be adjusted at the time of the partition The separate accounts in the names of the members are called Pathuvazhis and the point for determination is whether there is a custom that the amounts standing as debits in the Pathuvazhi accounts could be debited against the shares of the particular members at the time of the partition The evidence in the case shows that there is a practice in the Nattukottai Chettiar community for a member of the family to live separately after marriage and whatever he draws from the joint family is thereafter entered in a separate account called Pathuvazhi If the custom pleaded by the plaintiff is to be accepted in its entirety it would mean that in a joint family members have no right of maintenance after marriage a position which is inconsistent with the fundamental character of the joint family The evidence adduced on behalf of the plaintiff does not however go so far He is given a certain allowance out of the paternal estate but if he spends more he is debited with the excess amount With reference to the evidence adduced in support of this custom he observed This bold bid at revolutionising the law of partition among Nattukottai Chetties by giving a novel meaning to their thrifty method of upkeeping family accounts failed miserably On this difference of opinion the matter came before <NAME> who proceeded to decide the case on the footing that the custom had not been made out and granted a decree on the basis of an agreement of the parties There is a provision in the award that the Thanathu drawings off each party should be debited against them He also deposed that the eldest member of the family who manages the properties of the family is not entitled to any remuneration His evidence does not support the contention that even monies spent for maintenance could be debited against the member It will be seen therefore that there is no definiteness or certainty about the custom pleaded In the result this appeal also will be dismissed with costs dated be treated as a compromise and a decree passed in terms thereof In Indramani <NAME> ZI the decision in Arumugha <NAME> AIR Mad ZH has been dissented from and it has been held that unless the award is assented to after it is pronounced it cannot be treated as a compromise under Order Rule but defendant having consented to the interim award the plaintiff argues that a decree may he passed as against him under Order Rule In our opinion he is entitled to such a decree But as defendants to were minors at the time when the interim award was pronounced and as no sanction of the <ORG> was obtained under Order Rule for sanctioning the compromise on their behalf no decree could be passed as against them under Order Rule There can be an order in No of only in these terms A No of and of These two appeals are against application filed in No of for passing a decree under Order Rule on the ground that the defendants had consented to the interim award For the reasons given in Nos and of these appeals will have to be allowed and a compromise decree passed in terms of the award under Order Rule against defendants and
