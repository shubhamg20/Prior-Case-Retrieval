This appeal by special leave arises from the order of the Single Judge of <ORG> in Special Civil Application No of dated December wherein the learned Single Judge set aside the order of the Joint Judge <NAME> dated made in Misc The facts necessary for disposal of this appeal lie in a short compass The Land Acquisition Officer passed his award on December Pursuant thereto possession was taken on March by the competent officer and handed over to the corporation However the earlier appellants tenants who entered into leave and licence agreements with the <ORG> were allowed to get into possession Calling in question that order of eviction they went in appeal and writ petition but were unsuccessful <NAME> the learned Senior counsel for the appellants contended that under <ORG> <ORG> has power of revision where the appeal is not provided for either to it or subordinate court Since the Joint Judge had exercised the appellate power by operation of the <ORG> was devoid of jurisdiction to exercise the revisional power is not an appellate power but only one of correcting errors of jurisdiction Appellate Judge ex haustively dealt with all the points raised by the appellants it is one of taking an alternative view by <ORG> to the one taken by the appellate Judge Even in equity the appellants are entitled to remain in possession since they have been continuing under the respondents since uninterruptedly and they should be allowed to continue till the disposal of the suit by giving suitable directions for expeditious trial He also contended that in view of the resolutions passed by <ORG> on November and November suitable direction may be given to the Municipality to reconsider the matter whether the building is still needed for widening the road and based thereon they could take appropriate steps or to provide alternative shops <NAME> the learned Senior counsel appearing for the respondents on the other hand contended that the need for widening the road still subsists and that the <ORG> having taken possession of the building and the order of eviction passed against the appellant having been allowed to become final by disposing the by this Court the appellate Judge had committed palpable error of law in interfering with the order Having heard the learned counsel for the parties the question arises whether the appellant had shown that there was a prima facie case triable issue and balance of convenience for granting ad interim injunction pending the suit On expiry thereof the <ORG> had initiated proceedings for ejectment of the appellants and the order of ejectment had become final when the SLP was dismissed by this court Thereafter the appellants had no legal right to remain in possession of the shops The question then is whether an injunction could be granted in favour of the persons who remain in possession of the property Further question is whether an injunction could be granted against the rightful owner in favour of the persons Who remain in unlawful possession Grant of injunction is within the discretion of the court and such discretion is to be exercised in favour of the plaintiff only if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that unless the defendant is restrained by an order of injunction an irreparable loss or damage will be caused to the plaintiff during the pendency of the suit The court grants such relief according to the legal principles ex debito justifiae Before any such order is passed the court must be satisfied that a strong prima facie case has been made out by the plaintiff including on the question of maintainability of the suit and the balance of convenience is in his favour and refusal of injunction would cause irreparable injury to him Further the court should be always willing to extend its hand to protect a citizen who is being wronged or is being deprived of a property without any authority in law or without following the procedure which are fundamental and vital in nature But at the same time the judicial proceedings cannot be used to protect or to perpetuate a wrong committed by a person who approaches the court Prima facie case is not to be confused with prima facie title which has to be established on evidence at the trial Only prima facie case is a substantial question raised bona fide which needs investigation and a decision on merits Satisfaction that there is a prima facie case by itself is not sufficient to grant injunction The court further has to satisfy that noninterference by the court would result in irreparable injury to the party seeking relief and that there is no other remedy available to the party except one to grant injunction and he needs protection from the consequences of apprehended injury or dispossession Irreparable injury however does not mean that there must be no physical possibility of repairing the injury but means only that the injury must be a material one namely one that cannot be adequately compensated by way of damages The balance of convenience must be in favour of granting injunction The court while granting or refusing to grant injunction should exercise sound judicial discretion to find the amount of substantial mischief or injury which is likely to be caused to the parties if the injunction is refused and compare it with that which is likely to be caused to the other side if the injunction is granted The court has to exercise its sound judicial discretion in granting or refusing the relief of ad interim injunction pending the suit It is settled law that no injunction could be granted against the true owner at the instance of persons in unlawful possession It is true that the appellants placed reliance in their plaint on resolutions passed by the <ORG> They furnish no prima facie right or title to the appellants to have perpetual injunction restraining the <ORG> from taking possession of the building Thereafter no right was created in favour of the appellants to remain in possession There is thus neither balance of convenience nor irreparable injury would be caused to the appellants In <NAME> Law Relating to Injunctions Second revised and enlarged edition at page in para it is stated that an injunction will only be granted to prevent the breach of an obligation that is a duty enforceable by law existing in favour of the applicant who must have a personal interest in the matter At page in para it is further stated that if the court be of opinion that looking to these principles the case is not one for which an injunction is a fitting remedy it has a discretion to grant damages in lieu of an injunction At page it is stated that the court has jurisdiction to grant an injunction in those cases where pecuniary compensation would not afford adequate relief The expression adequate relief is not defined but it is probably used to mean such a compensation as would though not in specie in effect place the plaintiffs in the same position in which they stood before Plaintiff must therefore prove that there is an imminent danger of a substantial kind or that the apprehended injury if it does come will be irreparable The word imminent is used in the sense that the circumstances are such that the remedy sought is not premature the parties having regard to all the relevant circumstances The court will award such damages if it thinks fit to do so But no relief for dam ages will be granted if the plaintiff has not claimed such relief in the suit in The Law Quarterly Review Vol at page at <NAME> under Title Mareva Injunctions and Security for Judgment in a Framework of Interlocutory Remedies stated that if the plaintiff is likely to suffer irreparable or uncompensable damage no interlocutory injunction will be granted then provided that the plaintiff would be able to compensate the defendant for any unwarranted restraint on the defendant right pending trial the balance would tilt in favour of restraining the defendant pending trial At page it is stated that the court considering an application for an interlocutory injunction has four factors to consider first whether the plaintiff would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is denied secondly whether this harm outweighs any irreparable harm that the defendant would suffer from an injunction thirdly the parties relative prospects of success on the merits fourthly any public interest involved in the decision In Injunctions by <NAME> <ORG> at page it is stated that if the plaintiff obtains an interlocutory injuntion but subsequently the case goes to trial and he fails to obtain a perpetual order the defendant will meanwhile have been restrained unjustly and will be entitled to damages for any loss he has sustained The practice has therefore grown up in almost every case where an interlocutory injunction is to be granted of requiring the plaintiff to undertake to pay any damages subsequently found due to the defendant as compensation if the injunction cannot be justified at trial It would thus be clear that in a suit for perpetual injunction the court would enquire on affidavit evidence and other material placed before the court to find strong prima facie case and balance of convenience in favour of granting injunction otherwise irreparable damage or damage would ensue to the plaintiff The Court should also find whether the plaintiff would adequately be compensated by damages if injunction is not granted It is common experience that injunction normally is asked for and granted to prevent the public authorities or the respondents to proceed with execution of or implementing scheme of public utility or granted contracts for execution thereof Public interest is therefore one of the material and relevant considerations in either exercising or refusing to grant ad interim injunction While exercising the power of discretion the court should also adopt the procedure of calling upon the plaintiff to file a bond to the satisfaction of the court that in the event of his failing in the suit to obtain the relief asked for in the plaint he would adequately compensate the defendant for the loss en sued due to the order of injunction granted in favour of the plaintiff Even otherwise the court while exercising its equity jurisdiction in granting injunction as also juris diction and power to grant adequate compensation to mitigate the damages caused to the defendant by grant of injunction restraining to proceed with the execution of the work etc which is retrained by an order of injunction made by the court In this behalf the grant or re fusal of damages is not founded upon the original cause of action but the consequences of the adjudication by the con duct of the parties the court gets inherent jurisdiction in doing ex debito justifiae mitigating the damage suffered by the defendant by the act of the court in granting injunction restraining the defendant from proceeding with the action complained of in the suit The courts in the cases where injunction arc to be granted should necessarily consider the effect on public purpose thereof and also suitably mould the relief In the event the plaintiffs losing ultimately the suit they should necessarily bear the consequences The appeal is accordingly dismissed with costs
