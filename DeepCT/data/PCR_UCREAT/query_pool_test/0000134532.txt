These appeals are directed against the judgment of the Division Bench of <ORG> dated nd September dismissing the writ petitions The appellant filed objections under Section A of the Act on the th December submitting that the land be exempted from the proposed acquisition It was however observed in the proceedings of th June that the possession of the balance area of about Bighas would be taken after the removal of the structures with the help of the demolition squad This petition was dismissed in limine on the th August The appellant thereupon preferred Special CA Nos Leave Petition in this Court and after leave was granted the appeal was registered as A No of While the appeal was still pending the appellant filed Writ Petition No under Article of the Constitution of India in <ORG> It appears that an interim order was made by <ORG> in these proceedings on th of July staying dispossession of the appellant from the property in dispute and the said order was confirmed on th September It also appears from the record that while the aforementioned two matters were pending in this Court the appellant filed Suit No of on the Original Side of <ORG> praying for an injunction against the respondents including <ORG> that no structure be demolished and that no interference be made with the plaintiff possession and management of the Suit land It is the appellant case that though the CA Nos aforesaid Suit was transferred to <ORG> in Delhi on account of the revision of the pecuniary jurisdiction of <ORG> the said interim injunction still continued to operate but despite the interim orders <ORG> continued to impinge on the appellant property on which a Contempt Petition was filed in the High Court which in its order dated th May directed the respondent authorities to ensure compliance with <ORG> order dated nd April made in the civil suit Still dissatisfied the appellant filed No of in <ORG> challenging some facets of the alleged violation of the Master Plan of which had statedly made the entire proceedings for the planned development of Delhi incohate and which had rendered the acquisition without any authority of law This matter came up before <ORG> after notice on th February on which <ORG> observed that the petitioner was seeking two distinct prayers in the Writ Petition that the land which had been CA Nos acquired under the Land Acquisition Act should be released from acquisition and that the <ORG> should not be permitted to use the aforesaid land for a purpose other than that postulated in the Master Plan and the Zonal Development Plan and as the two prayers were mutually distinct and pertained to different causes of action one writ petition was not maintainable On this the learned senior counsel for the appellant Mr <NAME> stated that he would file two separate writ petitions for which liberty was granted and the papers of CWP No of were accordingly returned to the counsel The appellant thereupon moved two writ petitions i Nos praying that the respondent <ORG> be restrained from taking over possession of the land and Writ Petition No seeking to challenge the land acquisition proceedings which had been initiated by the Notification under Section and Declaration under Section of the Act in the year and respectively and also pleading that as the possession had not been taken the land be released under Section of the Act The Court further held that it was clear from the proceedings recorded by <NAME> Land Acquisition on th June in the presence of a large number of Revenue Officials that possession had indeed been taken over on that day after demarcation had been made with respect to bighas biswas including the land belonging to the appellant and that boundary pillars had been affixed CA Nos round the demarcated land and that the possession had further been handed over to <NAME> Tehsildar on th st rd and th of June The two writ petitions were accordingly dismissed by the Division Bench of <ORG> vide the impugned judgment leading to the present appeals as a consequence At the very outset Mr <NAME> the learned senior counsel for the appellant has candidly stated at the <ORG> that the appellant was no longer challenging the acquisition and the relief claimed in was therefore not being pursued in this appeal In this background Mr <NAME> has raised three arguments before us during the course of hearing He has first pointed out that it was the positive case of the appellant that the land in dispute was encircled by a boundary wall and as such possession thereof could be taken only after entering the land and not by any symbolic or paper possession As a corollary it has been submitted that there was no material on record to show that the actual physical possession had been taken as would preclude the withdrawal of the acquisition under Section of the Act It has finally been CA Nos submitted that there was ample evidence on record to show that the property in dispute was in fact surrounded by a wall and had some other structures as well and in view of the positive stand taken by the Land Acquisition Collector in his award dated th June that the possession of the area covered by structures would be the subject matter of a supplementary award the very basis of the judgment of <ORG> that the possession had been taken on the th June was erroneous Mr <NAME> and Mr <NAME> the learned counsel appearing for the <ORG> and <ORG> respectively have controverted the submissions and have pointed out that the appellant had for almost years been able to scuttle the development of the area by taking piecemeal stands in the writ petitions and civil suits from the year onwards and though the aforesaid matters had been rejected with positive findings that possession had been taken and that there was no wall or structure on the land in question It has also been submitted that the proper procedure had been adopted by the CA Nos Naib Tehsildar and that the possession had been taken over as per law on the th June and there was ample evidence to this effect which had been considered by <ORG> We have heard the learned counsel for the parties very carefully The Act provides a machinery for the acquisition of the land An acquisition is set in motion by a Notification under Section when it is proposed to acquire any land for public purpose and Section A envisages the filing of objections with regard to the proposed acquisition After the objections under Section A have been considered and been found without merit a declaration under Section of the Act is published that the land is indeed required for a public purpose Section of the Act provides that after all the proceedings and certain other formalities have been completed the Collector shall give public notice that the <ORG> intends to take possession of the land and calling upon the persons interested to file their claims for compensation The matter is then enquired into by the Collector who renders his award under Section of the Act and possession is taken by CA Nos the Collector under Section on which the land vests absolutely in the <ORG> free from all encumbrances It is the case of the respondent that all the procedures had been followed and that possession had been taken under Section on the th June and as such the question of its release under Section of the Act did not arise as this provision gives liberty to withdraw from the acquisition of any land of which possession has not been taken The question raised by Mr <NAME> is that as the area in question was very extensive i about bigas and the land belonging to the appellant was surrounded by a boundary wall symbolic possession was meaningless and some more positive action was called for To support this view he has relied on the three judgments cited earlier held that the principles underlying Order Rules and of the <ORG> prescribing the modes of CA Nos delivery of possession including symbolic and actual could be applied to proceedings under the Act but the other two Hon ble Judges <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> held that the said provisions could not be applied to proceedings under the Act and that actual possession thereof was required to be taken In this background the two Hon ble Judges observed as under We think it is enough to state that when the <ORG> proceeds to take possession of the land acquired by it under the Land Acquisition Act it must take actual possession of the land since all interests in the land are sought to acquired by it There can be no question of taking symbolical possession in the sense understood by judicial decision under the Code of Civil Procedure What the Act contemplates as a necessary condition of vesting of the land in the <ORG> is the taking of actual possession of the land How such possession may be taken would depend on the nature of the land There can be no hard and fast rule laying down what act would be sufficient to constitute taking of possession of land There cannot be an absolute and inviolable rule that merely going on the spot and making a declaration by beat of drum or otherwise would be sufficient to constitute taking of possession of land in every case But here in CA Nos our opinion since the land was lying fallow and there was no crop on it at the material time the act of the Tehsildar in going on the spot and inspecting the land for the purpose of determining what part was waste and arable and should therefore be taken possession of and determining its extent was sufficient to constitute taking on possession In <NAME> case supra the basic issue was as to whether the land which was the subject matter of acquisition could be acquired in view of the State policy that Abadi land was not to be acquired It is in this connection the Court observed that there appeared to be no conclusive evidence that possession had been taken from the land owner and the matter was left open for the land owner to approach <ORG> under Section of the Act to have land released In <NAME> case supra a reference was made to the judgment in <NAME> case supra and it was once again reiterated that the procedure for taking possession would depend upon the nature of the land and the extent thereof This Court then examined the context under which the judgment in <NAME> case had been rendered and held as under It is settled law by series of judgments of this Court that one of the accepted modes of taking possession of the acquired land is recording of a memorandum or Panchanama by the <ORG> in the presence of witnesses signed by him them and that would constitute taking possession of the land as it would be impossible to take physical possession of the acquired land No doubt <NAME> has contended that the appellant still retained their possession It is now well settled legal position that it is difficult to take physical possession of the land under compulsory acquisition The normal mode of taking possession is drafting the Panchnama in the presence of <NAME> and taking possession and giving delivery to the beneficiaries is the accepted mode of taking possession of the land Subsequent thereto the retention of possession would tantamount only to illegal or un lawful possession It would thus be seen from a cumulative reading of the aforesaid judgments that while taking possession of a large area of land with a large number of owners it would be impossible for the Collector or the Revenue Official to enter each bigha or biswas and to take possession thereof and that a pragmatic approach has to be adopted by the <ORG> It is CA Nos also clear that one of the methods of taking possession and handing it over to the beneficiary department is the recording of a <ORG> which can in itself constitute evidence of the fact that possession had been taken and the land had vested absolutely in the Government Mr <NAME> has however emphasized that some material documents which show the possession had not been taken on th June as alleged had been ignored by <ORG> which he has referred us to <ORG> for the years and showing the existence of <ORG> We find absolutely no merit in this plea We reproduce the relevant portion of the award herein under Wells and Structures The land under acquisition has number of wells water channel and structures There is yet CA Nos another circumstance perhaps even more relevant We find that no question had ever been raised by the appellant with regard to the presence of a wall in the objections filed under Section A or even in the responses filed to the notices under Section of the Act and the only prayer was that the land be exempted from acquisition Item no These omissions become more significant as several other landowners had claimed compensation for the superstructures that were existing on the acquired land It is also equally significant as pointed out by Mr <NAME> that no question had ever been raised by the appellant with regard to the existence of a wall or superstructure in any of the litigations prior to the present set of Writ Petitions Mr <NAME> has however referred us to the objections dated th November showing the existence of a wall These objections are to our mind meaningless as they had not been filed in response to the notification CA Nos under Section which had been published in the year and were filed after the declaration under Section had been made and are therefore an obvious after thought It also bears notice that despite the claim under this document no plea with regard to the existence of a wall had been raised at any stage till the filing of the present petitions in the year Mr <NAME> has with great emphasis pointed out that from the affidavit dated th July sworn by Mr <NAME> Under Secretary <ORG> it was clear that the appellant continued to remain in possession on account of the stay of dispossession granted by <ORG> on th July in WP No and the confirmation of the said order on th September and as such the stand of the appellants that possession had been taken was not correct We have however already observed that possession had been taken between th and th June and the acquired land thus stood vested in the State CA Nos free from all encumbrances under Section of the Act The Bench observed that the letter was based on a misconception as the land owner had re entered the acquired land immediately after its possession had been taken by the government ignoring the scenario that he stood divested of the possession under Section of the Act This Court observed as under This was plainly erroneous view for the legal position is clear that even if the appellant entered upon the land and resumed possession of it the very next moment after the land was actually taken possession of and CA Nos became vested in the Government such act on the part of the appellant did not have the effect of obliterating the consequences of vesting To our mind therefore even assuming that the appellant had re entered the land on account of the various interim orders granted by the courts or even otherwise it would have no effect for two reasons that the suits petitions were ultimately dismissed and that the land once having vested in the <ORG> by virtue of Section of the Act re entry by the land owner would not obliterate the consequences of vesting Undoubtedly every citizen has a right to utilize all legal means which are open to him in a bid to vindicate and protect his rights but if the court comes to the CA Nos conclusion that the pleas raised are frivolous and meant to frustrate and delay an acquisition which is in public interest deterrent action is called for The appeals are accordingly dismissed with costs which are determined at Rupees two lacs
