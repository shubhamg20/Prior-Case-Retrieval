It requires to be noted at this stage that a Selection Committee also described as <ORG> comprising the Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister and three other Secretaries to the Government of India had been set up by the Minister for final evaluation of the bid He submitted an interim report on The actual selection of the licensee should be made primarily on the consideration of rentals and the marks obtained in respect of foreign exchange inflow and outflow criterion and experience of the licensee To that extent the order granting licence to parties for each of the cities was set aside It is borne out by records that out of the seven criteria in evaluating the financial bid six parameters alone were taken into consideration This was done in order to arrive at an equated or effective figure of monthly rental for each bidder Sir Kindly refer letter of even No dated informing you that you have been provisionally selected for franchise for providing cellular mobile telephone service at on a nonexclusive basis The matter has been reconsidered in the light of the judgment delivered by <ORG> in this case It is quite interesting to note that of the four companies which were having some deficiencies in their tender documents in the first stage and were recommended for consideration by the first <ORG> three companies including <ORG> made it to the final list of eight The English decision on this aspect which will support the contention is <ORG> <NAME> In law there is no degree of bias Therefore there is a breach of the fundamental condition of the bid If a change is allowed it would amount to technical violation of the bid <ORG> had been rejected at various stages of consideration on the ground that there was criminal complaint investigation pending against it The Minister had also agreed but reversed that decision on the last day and directed its consideration for inclusion in Madras on the purported ground that Madras was the least popular of the stations and that if any delay is caused due to complications on account of <ORG> investigation would have the least adverse effect for lack of competition <ORG> noted that no material had been brought on record to show that there was any complaint against <ORG> There are five glaring errors in the selection The counter affidavit filed on behalf of <ORG> does not mention that there was a delay by <ORG> as held by <ORG> On the contrary the facts disclose there was no delay whatever i Persons having less than one lakh experience will not be considered In the case of <ORG> it was having only eighty one thousand lines There is a <ORG> inquiry pending against it SCC at paragraph this Court has held that there is an obligation to communicate the reasons Mr <NAME> learned counsel appearing for <ORG> in opposing the arguments advanced on behalf of the appellants submits that service operation should not be read in a narrow sense Besides the services are also essential they should be regarded as a part of operation Mr <NAME> learned counsel appearing for <ORG> submits that though this respondent supports the judgment of <ORG> insofar as it is allowed the writ petition filed by <ORG> the same ought to be reconsidered Hence there is no question of <ORG> condoning the defect In the case of <ORG> there is an unconditional compliance The documents filed by the respondent clearly show that there is a surplus of approximately three crore rupees available from the foreign collaborator in the first year The argument that there is a common collaborator of <ORG> and <ORG> proceeds on the footing that <ORG> is collaborating with <ORG> There are no common directors on the boards of two companies Arguing on behalf of <ORG> Mr <NAME> learned counsel submits that the technical competency and capacity to execute the contract by this respondent with its joint venture partner is not in doubt There was no <ORG> inquiry on the date of the above judgment It was after the judgment dated the FIR was filed which has been allowed to be proceeded with by way of directions in petition under Section of the Criminal Procedure Code The said ratio will apply to this case With regard to compliance statement it was stated that the company agrees to fully comply with all paragraphs of Chapter II of the General Conditions and Chapter Tariffs of Document No MMC FIN without any deviation and reservation No doubt there is a failure in the first instance to state about compliance with Chapters and IV This is an accidental omission Other argument is advanced that there is a defect in the compliance statement It must be left to the authorities The contrary arguments advanced on behalf of the appellants against this respondent are not tenable The interference under Article of the Constitution where the power of judicial review has been exercised by <ORG> under Article There is a possibility of fallibility inherent in all fact findings There is no mention of any particular criterion on the basis of which the selection was to be made The learned counsel after referring to the relevant case law submits that cases of bias and ostensible bias had to be regarded in the light of their own circumstances In this case Mr <NAME> is only one of the officers in <ORG> which has over employees and officers of his rank in offices all over India It took the chance and benefit of being short listed despite the knowledge of Mr <NAME> involvement Therefore <ORG> rightly held that <NAME> was not taken into consideration in awarding marks for foreign partners experience Inasmuch as they had the same foreign partner as <ORG> which secured a higher place than <ORG> it was rejected and the choice went to the next bidder in the marking list After the above considerations were taken into account the remaining companies were selected which led to the writ petition Beyond that it has no particular interest as to who is selected However it becomes necessary to answer the allegations made about the actual selection and whether there was any bias on the part of the selection committee Therefore it is impossible to predicate the cut off limits which could be set or which conditions have to be relaxed or softened In this case there is no such reasonable likelihood In support of this argument reliance is placed on <NAME> and <NAME> State of Haryana <ORG> para As regards the parameter in relation to project financing it was kept in view by taking into account the estimated number of subscribers installation charges monthly rental any other charges etc Concerning rental it was specifically averred in the counter before <ORG> that the other charges had also been included while calculating quoted rental Even if this condition has been relaxed in favour of certain bidders there is nothing wrong With regard to the foreign collaborator of <ORG> there was no change In any event where the judgment of <ORG> had been given effect to and a proper evaluation has been done no interference is warranted This shows that there was lack of candour on the part of the <ORG> It is mentioned that <ORG> was taken into consideration Having regard to the above arguments we propose to deal with the matter from the following five aspects It cannot be denied that the principles of judicial review would apply to the exercise of contractual powers by Government bodies in order to prevent arbitrariness or favoritism However it must be clearly stated that there are inherent limitations in exercise of that power of judicial review It is expected to protect the financial interest of the <ORG> But the principles laid down in Article of the Constitution have to be kept in view while accepting or refusing a tender Of course if the said power is exercised for any collateral purpose the exercise of that power will be struck down It is not intended to take away from those authorities the powers and AC All ER All ER discretions properly vested in them by law and to substitute the courts as the bodies making the decisions It is made effective by the court quashing the administrative decision without substituting its own decision and is to be contrasted with an appeal where the appellate tribunal substitutes its own decision on the merits for that of the administrative officer Whether a decision making authority exceeded its powers The extent of the duty to act fairly will vary from case to case Shortly put the grounds upon which an administrative action is subject to control by judicial review can be classified as under All ER All ER Amin Entry Clearance Officer All ER QB All ER i Illegality This means the decision maker must understand correctly the law that regulates his decision making power and must give effect to it The above are only the broad grounds but it does not rule out addition of further grounds in course of time In all these cases the test to be adopted is that the court should consider whether something has gone wrong of a nature and degree which requires its intervention In <NAME> Johnson a specially constituted divisional court had to consider the validity of a bye law made by a local authority In the leading judgment of Lord <NAME> of Killowen the approach to be adopted by the court was set out In an extempore judgment Lord <NAME> drew attention to the fact that the word unreasonable had often been used in a sense which comprehended different grounds of review as an example of a frivolous and foolish reason was in another sense taking into consideration extraneous matters and might be so unreasonable that it could almost be described as being done in bad faith see also <ORG> ex Chetnik Developments Ltd Chapter supra He summarised the principles as follows The <ORG> is entitled to investigate the action of the local authority with a view to seeing whether or not they have taken into account matters which they ought not to have taken into account or conversely have refused to take into account or neglected to take into account matter which they ought to take into account Once that question is answered in favour of the local authority it may still be possible to say that although the local authority had kept within the four comers of the matters which they ought to consider they have nevertheless come to a conclusion so unreasonable that no reasonable authority could ever have come to it The power of the court to interfere in each case is not as an appellate authority to override a decision of the local authority but as a judicial authority which is concerned and concerned only to see whether the local authority has contravened the law by acting in excess of the power which <ORG> has confided in them The modem statement of the principle is found in a passage in the speech of Lord <NAME> in <ORG> Minister for Civil Service KB All ER Ch All ER Rep AC WLR All ER By irrationality I mean what can now be succinctly referred to as Wednesbury unreasonableness <ORG> <ORG> It applies to a decision which is so outrageous in its defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at A decision of a public authority will be liable to be quashed or otherwise dealt with by an appropriate order in judicial review proceedings where the court concludes that the decision is such that no authority properly directing itself on the relevant law and acting reasonably could have reached it Thus in <ORG> <ORG> the Secretary of <ORG> referred to a number of factors which led him to the conclusion that a non resident bar in a hotel was operated in such a way that the bar was not an incident of the hotel use for planning purposes but constituted a separate use <ORG> analysed the factors which led the Secretary of <ORG> to that conclusion and having done so set it aside Such a situation as a state court expressed it many years ago is not a case of the blind leading the blind but of one who has always been deaf and blind insisting that he can see and hear better than one who has always had his eyesight and hearing and has always used them to the utmost advantage in ascertaining the truth in regard to the matter in question At other times it says nothing about it But nevertheless the courts will if called upon act in a supervisory capacity The courts will ensure that the body acts in accordance with the law If a question arises on the interpretation of words the courts will decide it by declaring what is the correct interpretation And if the decision making body has gone wrong in its interpretation they can set its order aside If the decision making body is influenced by considerations which ought not to influence it or fails to take into account matters which it ought to take into account the court will interfere If the decision making body comes to its decision on no evidence or comes to an unreasonable finding so unreasonable that a reasonable person would not have come to it then again the courts will interfere In exercising these powers the courts will take into account any reasons which the body may give for its decisions If it gives no reasons in a case when it may reasonably be expected to do so the courts may infer that it has no good reason for reaching its conclusion and act accordingly At it is stated thus A great deal of administrative law boils down to the scope of review problem defining what degree of deference a court will accord to an agency findings conclusions and choices including choice of procedures <ORG> Justice <NAME> stated A formula for judicial review of administrative action may afford grounds for certitude but cannot assure certainty of application There are no talismanic words that can avoid the process of judgment Quashing decisions may impose heavy administrative burdens on the administration divert resources towards reopening decisions and lead to increased and unbudgeted expenditure Sir <NAME> in <ORG> ex <ORG> observed thus We are sitting as a public law court concerned to review an administrative decision albeit one which has to be reached by the application of judicial or quasi judicial principles But in judging the relevance of an interest however legitimate regard has to be had to the purpose of the administrative process concerned and finality unless there are compelling reasons to the contrary It is also well settled that the authorities like Doordarshan should act fairly and their action should be legitimate and fair and transaction should be without any aversion malice or affection Nothing should be done which gives the impression of favoritism or nepotism While as mentioned herein before fair play in action in matters like the present one is an essential requirement similarly however free play in the joints is also a necessary concomitant for an administrative body WLR All ER CA para functioning in an administrative sphere or quasi administrative sphere as the present one Judged from that standpoint of view though all the proposals might not have been considered strictly in accordance with order of precedence it appears that these were considered fairly reasonably objectively and without any malice or ill will <NAME> points out The doctrine that powers must be exercised reasonably has to be reconciled with the no less important doctrine that the court must not usurp the discretion of the public authority which <ORG> appointed to take the decision Within the bounds of legal reasonableness is the area in which the deciding authority has genuinely free discretion If it passes those bounds it acts ultra vires The court must therefore resist the temptation to draw the bounds too tightly merely according to its own opinion It must strive to apply an objective standard which leaves to the deciding authority the full range of choices which the legislature is presumed to have intended With the question whether a particular policy is wise or foolish the court is not concerned it can only interfere if to pursue it is beyond the powers of the authority In the arguments there is some general misapprehension of the scope of the reasonableness test in administrative law By whose standards of reasonableness that a matter is to be decided Some phrases which pass from one branch of law to another as did the expressions void and voidable from private law areas to public law situations carry over with them meanings that may be inapposite in the changed context Some such thing has happened to the words reasonable reasonableness etc This is the essence of what is now commonly called Wednesbury unreasonableness after the now famous case in which Lord <NAME> MR expounded it There is no unfettered discretion in public law A public authority possesses powers only to use them for public good This imposes the duty to act fairly and to adopt a procedure which is fairplay in action this Court observed thus SCC para In contracts having commercial element some more discretion has to be conceded to the authorities so that they may enter into contracts with persons keeping an eye on the augmentation of the revenue But even in such matters they have to follow the norms recognised by courts while dealing with public property It is not possible for courts to question and adjudicate every decision taken by an authority because many of the Government Undertakings which in due course have acquired the monopolist position in matters of sale and purchase of products and with so many ventures in hand they can come out with a plea that it is not always possible to act like a quasi judicial authority while awarding contracts Under some special circumstances a discretion has to be conceded to the authorities who have to enter into contract giving them liberty to assess the overall situation for purpose of taking a decision as to whom the contract be awarded and at what terms If the decisions have been taken in bona fide manner although not strictly following the norms laid down by the courts such decisions are upheld on the principle laid down by Justice <NAME> that courts while judging the constitutional validity of executive decisions must grant certain measure of freedom of play in the joints to the executive this Court held thus SCC para the Government had the right to either accept or reject the lowest offer but that of course if done on a policy should be on some rational and reasonable grounds this Court observed as under SCC para When the Government is trading with the public the democratic form of Government demands equality and absence of arbitrariness and discrimination in such transactions The activities of the Government have a public element and therefore there should be fairness and equality The <ORG> need not enter into any contract with anyone but if it does so it must do so fairly without discrimination and without unfair procedure The court does not sit as a court of appeal but merely reviews the manner in which the decision was made Normally speaking the decision to accept the tender or award the contract is reached by process of negotiations through several tiers In other words a fair play in the joints is a necessary concomitant for an administrative body functioning in an administrative sphere or quasi administrative sphere Quashing decisions may impose heavy administrative burden on the administration and lead to increased and unbudgeted expenditure Based on these principles we will examine the facts of this case since they commend to us as the correct principles Mr <NAME> learned counsel appearing for <ORG> argued that there are clear instances of arbitrariness Then again one of the prescribed criterion is which carries marks namely the financial strength of the partner company For this purpose we have to go by the data furnished by the bidders at its face value It has alsomade distinction between loans from public financial institutions and banks Therefore there is a confusion on the part of <ORG> about this requirement with loans from the banks Therefore no dividend would have been paid to their foreign collaborators participating in the equity of company When a subscriber goes into the area of another operator who has a roaming agreement with his another operator the details of the subscriber available in the HLR Home Location Register of the home MSC Mobile Switching Centre are obtained by the visitor MSC and placed in the VLR Visitor Location Register How should the test of disqualification for likelihood of bias be formulated A more common formulation of the test is Would a member of the public looking at the situation as a whole reasonably suspect that a member of the adjudicating body would be biased Another common formulation is Is there in fact a real likelihood of bias There is no need on either formulation to prove actual bias indeed the courts may refuse to entertain submissions designed to establish the actual bias of a member of an independent tribunal on the ground that such an inquiry would be unseemly Seldom indeed will one find a situation in which reasonable persons adequately apprised of the facts will reasonably suspect bias but a court reviewing the facts will hold that there was no real likelihood of bias In ninety nine cases out of a hundred it is enough for the court to ask itself whether a reasonable person viewing the facts would think that there was a substantial possibility of bias Unlike allegations of bias by reason of the pecuniary interest of the decision maker however allegations of bias founded upon a personal involvement will only result in disqualification where there is a real likelihood that a hearing will not be fair But not all family relationships will disqualify and by way of contrast on the circumstances of one particular case it was said that a board of adjustment could decide an application by a company for permission to develop a free parking area despite the fact that an employee of the company was the wife of one board member and the fact that a third or fourth cousin of another board member was the president of the company Disqualification on the basis of personal involvement is not of course limited to the above two situations but may result whenever there is a sufficient nexus between the decision maker and a party to justify the appearance that this nexus may influence the decision reached of <NAME> <ORG> ex <NAME> The last cited case involved a former officer of <ORG> who later sat as a member of <ORG> inquiring into alleged false and scandalous allegations made by a teacher against various persons including the officer in question and during the course of his judgment <NAME> <NAME> observed Where bias arises not from pecuniary interest the officer must have so conducted himself that a high probability arises of a bias inconsistent with the fair performance of his duties with the result A Coun SW CT Civ App Tex QB All ER WLR WN NSW that a substantial distrust of the result must exist in the minds of reasonable persons ex McCarthy Nothing is to be done which creates even a suspicion that there has been an improper interference with the course of justice dissented only on the inference to be drawn from the facts The test which we have to apply is whether or not a reasonable man in all the circumstances might suppose that there was an improper interference with the course of justice In the judgment of this court the right test is that prescribed by <NAME> in <NAME> <NAME> namely that to disqualify a person from acting in a judicial or quasi judicial capacity on the ground of interest Sol Jo All ER QB WLR KB All ER Rep All ER KB All ER QB other than pecuniary or proprietary in the subject matter of the proceeding a real likelihood of bias must be shown <NAME> of the grounds of his application might create a more sinister impression than the full facts as found by this court all or most of which would have been available to the applicant had he pursued his inquiries on learning that Mr <NAME> was a member of <ORG> and none of these further facts was disputed at the hearing of this motion In <ORG> <NAME> it was held thus All ER in considering whether there was a real likelihood of bias the court does not look at the mind of the justice himself or at the mind of the chairman of the tribunal or whoever it may be who sits in a judicial capacity It does not look to see if there was a real likelihood that he would or did in fact favour one side at the expense of the other The court looks at the impression which would be given to other people Even if he was as impartial as could be nevertheless if right minded persons would think that in the circumstances there was a real likelihood of bias on his part then he should not sit We accept the view of Cross expressed in <NAME> <ORG> that there is really little if any difference between the two tests If a reasonable person who has no knowledge of the matter beyond knowledge of the relationship which subsists between some members of the tribunal and one of the parties would think that there might well be bias then there is in his opinion a real likelihood of bias Of course someone else with inside knowledge of the character of the members in question might say Although things don look very well in fact there is no real likelihood of bias We conclude that the test to be applied can conveniently be expressed by slightly adapting in words of Lord <NAME> in a test which he laid down in Uxbridge Justices ex Burbridge and referred to by him in <NAME> ex <NAME> would a reasonable and fair minded person sitting in court and knowing all the relevant facts have a reasonable suspicion that a fair trial for the applicant was not possible In <ORG> <NAME> holds Cases of bias and ostensible bias had to be regarded in the light of their own circumstances The circumstances of this case could have no relevance to other cases The principle says <NAME> nemo debet esse judex in causa propria sua precludes a justice who is interested in the subject matter of a dispute from acting as a justice therein In our opinion there is and can be no doubt about the validity of this principle and we are prepared to assume that this principle applies not only to the justices as mentioned by <NAME> but to all tribunals and bodies which are given jurisdiction to determine judicially the rights of parties A similar argument was rejected by this Court in <NAME> case <ORG> would normally be guided by the list approved by <ORG> <ORG> Further to say that such author member is only one of the members of <ORG> <ORG> is to overlook the fact that the author member can subtly influence the minds of the other members against selecting books by other authors in preference to his own It can also be that books by some of the other members ma also have been submitted for selection and there can be between them a quid pro quo or in other words you see that my book is selected and in return I will do the same for you In either case when a book of an author member comes up for consideration the other members would feel themselves embarrassed in frankly discussing its merits Such author member may also be a person holding a high official position whom the other members may not want to displease It can be that the other members may not be influenced by the fact that the book which they are considering for approval was written by one of their members All these considerations require that an author member should not be a member of any such committee or subcommittee Where reasonable likelihood of bias is alleged on the ground of relationship the question would always be as to how close is the degree of relationship or in other words is the nearness of relationship so great as to give rise to reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the authority making the selection Reference was made therein to a dictum laid down by Justice <NAME> in <ORG> of the District of Columbia <NAME> which is reproduced as under The judicial process demands that a judge move within the framework of relevant legal rules and the covenanted modes of thought for ascertaining them There is a good deal of shallow talk that the judicial robe does not change the man within it The fact is that on the whole judges do lay aside private views in discharging their judicial functions But it is also true that reason cannot control the subconscious influence of feelings of which it is unaware When there is ground for believing that such unconscious feelings may operate in the ultimate judgment or may not unfairly lead others to believe they are operating judges rescue themselves They do not sit in judgment It was sought to be urged that the petitioner had lost confidence in the sole arbitrator and was apprehensive that the arbitrator was biased against the petitioner It is well said that once the arbitrator enters in an arbitration the arbitrator must not be guilty of any act which can possibly be construed as indicative of partiality or unfairness It is US Ed not a question of the effect which misconduct on his part had in fact upon the result of the proceeding but of what effect it might possibly have produced It is not enough to show that even if there was misconduct on his part the award was unaffected by it and was in reality just arbitrator must not do anything which is not in itself fair and impartial Lord <NAME> in <NAME> De Vosci Justice of Queen Country observed as follows By bias I understand a real likelihood of an operative prejudice whether conscious or unconscious There must in my opinion be reasonable evidence to satisfy us that there was a real likelihood of bias I do not think that their vague suspicions of whimsical capricious and unreasonable people should be made a standard to regulate our action here It might be a different matter if suspicion rested on reasonable grounds was reasonably generated but certainly mere flimsy elusive morbid suspicions should not be permitted to form a ground of decision <NAME> for holding administrative acts to be voidable where according to principle they are void may be a desire to extend the discretionary powers of the <ORG> In this case as noted above the crucial test is whether there was a real likelihood of bias As to how Mr <NAME> the son of Mr <NAME> came to be appointed in <ORG> is explained in the additional affidavit filed on behalf of <ORG> Respondent by Mr <NAME> Corporate Personnel Manager of <ORG> including Respondent Company Thereafter the short listed candidates were called for interview on various dates It is to be seen that Mr <NAME> is only one of the officers in <ORG> which has over employees in offices all over India There are officers of his rank As such he could exercise all the powers under Section of the Indian Telegraphs Act of Such a <ORG> has the right to grant cellular operating licences to the successful party and also reject any bids without assigning any reason paragraph where it was reiterated that even if all the members of the <ORG> competent to determine a matter were subject to disqualification they might be authorised and obliged to hear that matter by virtue of the operation of the common law doctrine of necessity An adjudicator who is subject to disqualification on the ground of bias or interest in the matter which he has to decide may in certain circumstances be required to adjudicate if there is no other person who is competent or authorised to be adjudicator or if a quorum cannot be formed without him or if no other competent tribunal can be constituted Since we have reached this conclusion we are not going to the other questions argued by Mr <NAME> whether <ORG> or <ORG> could urge this point relating to bias After finding that only three companies qualified for selection on the following note was made by Mr <NAME> Adviser Operations The financial bid which was approved by the apex committee was given to the short listed bidders and these were received and opened on So far as the rental and other allied parameters are concerned there are wide variations of rent deposit registration connection fee Thus it clearly shows that they have not complied with these important conditions which form the very basis of the financial bid It is evident that the bidder has serious reservations about financial conditions and operative conditions and if granted a licence there is a possibility of litigation ii Since we require good operators with experience the minimum of marks out of for this parameter is considered a must and those bidders who have scored less than for this parameter should be disqualified <ORG> on an exclusive basis While making the final selection it should be borne in mind that <ORG> has got a problem which is explained in the notes of <ORG> placed below <ORG> SFR France There is no other bidder who qualifies for giving the licence On the Chairman TC made the following note In pursuance of the orders of the <ORG> a Committee consisting of Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister in his capacity as Chairman <ORG> Secretary <ORG> Secretary <ORG> and <ORG> was appointed to make recommendations regarding selection of the franchisees to provide Cellular Mobile Telephone Service in the four metro cities It is therefore proposed to issue a letter to the members of <ORG> as per draft placed below Chapter of General Conditions in paragraph states Experience of the Foreign operating partner On Mr <NAME> Adviser Operations in his note in the file inter alia stated as follows Since we require good operators with experience the mini mum of marks out of for this parameter is considered a must and those bidders who have scored less than for this parameter should be disqualified <ORG> indicated the parameters in which it stated that the committee decided to consider foreign companies who have experience of operating a cellular system of at least five years and who have developed a reasonable sized network subscribers Inter alia it stated in the report of <ORG> Also since GSM technology is only now beginning to come into commercial operation the <ORG> decided to consider foreign companies who have experience of operating a cellular system of at least years and who have developed a reasonable sized network subscribers It was suggested by Mr <NAME> Adviser Operations that those who have secured less than marks for this parameter should be disqualified There was no mention of <ORG> We are not in a position to accept the contentions of Mr <NAME> that these criteria were evolved as tailor made to suit some other bidders and knock off others At the beginning of there were already some million subscribers The reliance placed by Mr <NAME> and learned Solicitor General on paragraph Even otherwise the respondents say that this had no impact in the case of <ORG> as its collaborators included <ORG> who was one of the largest service providers in Experience of providing service was an important consideration and experience of <ORG> in computing <ORG> foreign collaborators was correctly included in the computations and thus its experience exceeded lakh lines The respondents say that <ORG> was treated on this basis and not on the basis of lines In support of this argument Mr <NAME> learned Solicitor General submitted that all services were to be provided by the licensee and though <ORG> had no operating experience it was having service experience for rendering service to subscribers which was an important factor The operation and service though go hand in hand we do not find anything wrong in taking into account the experience of <ORG> which has been done by the respondents Therefore there is nothing wrong in the same There is no change in joint venture Mr <NAME> has rightly placed reliance on the abovesaid two rulings relevant passages are quoted as under paras In the first place although as we have explained above para cannot but be read with para and that the supply of some of the documents referred to in para is indispensable to assess whether the applicant fulfils the pre qualifying requirements set out in para it will be too extreme to hold that the omission to supply every small detail referred to in para would affect the eligibility under para and disqualify the tenderer The question how far the delayed supply or omission to supply any one or more of the details referred to therein will affect any of the pre qualifying conditions is a matter which it is for the <ORG> to assess regarding output of concrete and brick work had been supplied in time The delay was only in supplying the details regarding hollow cement blocks and to what extent this lacuna affected the conditions in para was for the <ORG> to assess court may place on the NIT the way in which the tender documents issued by it has been understood and implemented by the <ORG> is explained in its note which sets out the general procedure which the <ORG> was following in regard to NITs issued by it from time to time Para of the note makes it clear that the <ORG> took the view that para alone incorporated the minimum pre qualifying eligibility conditions and the data called for under para was in the nature of general requirements It further clarifies that while tenders will be issued only to those who comply with the pre qualifying conditions any deficiency in the general requirements will not disqualify the applicant from receiving tender documents and that data regarding these requirements could be supplied later Right or wrong this was the way they had understood the standard stipulations and on the basis of which it had processed the applications for contracts all along They only decided in view of the contentions raised by the appellant that para should als be treated as part of the pre qualifying conditions that they would make it specific and clear in their future NITs that only the fulfillment of pre qualifying conditions would be mandatory If a party has been consistently and bona fide interpreting the standards prescribed by it in a particular manner we do not think this Court should interfere though it may be inclined to read or construe the conditions differently Thirdly the conditions and stipulations in a tender notice like this have two types of consequences The first is that the party issuing the tender has the right to punctiliously and rigidly enforce them Thus if a party does not strictly comply with the requirements of para or VI of the NIT it is open to the <ORG> to decline to consider the party for the contract and if a party comes to court saying that the <ORG> should be stopped from doing so the court will decline relief The second consequence indicated by this <ORG> in earlier decisions is not that the <ORG> cannot deviate from these guidelines at all in any situation but that any deviation if made should not result in arbitrariness or discrimination The requirements in a tender notice can be classified into two categories those which lay down the essential conditions of eligibility and the others which are merely ancillary or subsidiary with the main object to be achieved by the condition In the first case the authority issuing the tender may be required to enforce them rigidly <ORG> observed thus We also do not find any error on the part of the respondents in treating the financial bid of <ORG> in order if at that stage <ORG> dropped one of its three foreign collaborators which were named by it at the technical bid stage as otherwise financial bid satisfied all the criteria and dropping of one of the collaborators made no difference It further observed We therefore find that stand of the petitioner that any undue preference had been given to some of the companies cannot be upheld We even otherwise do not find that deviation or relaxation in the standards prescribed has resulted in any arbitrariness or discrimination Yet another attack that is made against <ORG> is that it submitted its application for foreign collaborator on to <ORG> beyond the cut off date of It should not loom large because there was a confusion as to who was competent authority to receive the application They have accepted these conditions through a letter explaining their earlier non compliance as typographical error The compliance statement as submitted by <ORG> is as under Compliance Statement This Company hereby agrees to fully comply with all Technical Commercial and General conditions of Tender Document No MMC including amendments clarifications issued by <ORG> without any deviations and reservations Therefore obviously there is no reference to either Chapter III Operating Conditions or Chapter IV Financial Conditions Accordingly enclosed herewith is a confected Compliance Statement duly signed by the authorised signatory of the <ORG> which may kindly be taken on regard There is no remedy no escape Where the matter is purely technical the court should not exercise the power of judicial review We find great force in this submission I have examined the case again Any delay in allotment of licence to <ORG> on account of the <ORG> investigations will have the least adverse effect in Madras for lack of competition to other licensee There was nothing on the record of the respondents to suggest that any <ORG> enquiry was pending against this company There was no FIR and no preliminary report adverse to the company and we feel the ghost of <ORG> has been unnecessarily brought into play However since the company has not complained we will leave the matter at that Therefore as on the date of selection there was no adverse report against <ORG> A letter dated by <ORG> was addressed to the appellants as follows <ORG> <ORG> New Delhi Dated No TM To <ORG> Bombay House Homi Modi Street Bombay Kind attention Shri A Baig Sub Tender No MMC FIN for franchise for cellular mobile telephone service for Bombay Delhi Calcutta and Madras That matter has been reconsidered in the light of the judgment delivered by <ORG> in this case and a revised list of provisionally selected bidders in the cities of Bombay Delhi Calcutta and Madras has been prepared
