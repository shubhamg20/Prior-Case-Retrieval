This is an appeal against an order of <NAME> allowing certain amendments of the plaint and granting fresh leave under Clause of the Letters Patent in respect of such amendments The plaintiff respondent which is a registered partnership firm carrying on business at Old China Bazar Street Calcutta filed a suit in this Court on or about the th December against the appellants <NAME> and <NAME> describing the former as the <NAME> or Manager of a joint Hindu Mitakshara family consisting of himself and his sons <NAME> and <NAME> and as carrying on a <ORG> family business under the name and style of Shanharlal <NAME> along wiw <NAME> at Katihar and also at Labha in the District of Purnea in the State of Bihar for recovery of a sum of Rs was found due and owing by the defendants to the plaintiff firm but later on it was discovered that there was a slight error in the account and the amount actually due was Rs There were further dealings and transactions between the parties after that date and as a result of such further dealings and transactions a sum of Rs It is to be noted that the suit was filed after obtaining leave under Clause of the Letters Patent Then in paragraph of the plaint it was stated that in the defendants appointed the then registered partnership firm of <ORG> as then constituted and consisting of four partners <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> as their commission agents In Paragraph a of the plaint it was stated that the firm which was appointed the Commission Agent acted as such till th April on which date three partners namely <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> retired from the said firm and all their rights liabilities assets credits and benefits of all contracts which accrued or were to accrue end the goodwill of the firm were assigned by the retiring partners in favour of <NAME> by a deed dated the th May In paragraph it was stated that the defendants had knowledge and notice of the retirement of three partners and about the assignment and the dealings and transactions continued between the defendants and <NAME> until th June which he acquired by reason of the deed of th May were assigned and became vested in the partners of the plaintiff firm as constituted on the th June in paragraph it was stated that the defendants had full knowledge and notice of the aforesaid facts and the <ORG> business was by concurrence of the defendants and the plaintiff firm as newly constituted carried on according to the terms and conditions mentioned in paragraph of the plaint It will thus appear that by making certain alterations in paragraph of the original plaint and by introducing paragraphs a and some substantial amendments were made in the cause of action as originally pleaded in the plaint It may be pointed out at this stage that this application for amendment was made inasmuch as the defendants in their written statement filed in answer to the original plaint took up the defence that there was no agreement appointing the plaintiff firm which filed the suit as commission agent as pleaded in the plaint but the defendants had appointed a firm in which <ORG> and the three <NAME> were partners A further point was taken in the written statement that besides the persons whose names are mentioned in the original plaint there were other members of the joint family of the defendants who were not mads parties to the suit and so the suit was bad for non joinder of parties The application for amendment having come up for hearing before <NAME> the learned Judge by his order dated the th March granted fresh leave under Clause of the Letters Patent in respect of the amendments asked for and allowed all the amendments that had been asked for in respect of the plaint The defendants have thereupon preferred the present appeal against the said order of the learned Judge and have contended before us that the amendments asked for introduced a totally different cause of action and so should not have been allowed and further the <ORG> had no power to grant fresh leave under Clause of the Letters Patent to allow any amendment of a plaint which added to or altered the cause of action as pleaded in the original plaint and in respect of which leave under Clause of the Letters Patent had been obtained prior to the institution of the suit According to the learned counsel for the appellants leave under Clause of the Letters Patent is a condition precedent to the institution of a suit and it can be given only once by the <ORG> in respect of a suit at the time of its institution The attention of the <ORG> has been drawn by the learned counsel for the appellants to decisions of the different High <ORG>s which have a bearing on this point In this case <NAME> after referring to certain decisions of the Calcutta Madras and Bombay High <ORG>s made the following observations From all these authorities it seems to me to result that the grant of leave under Clause of the Letters Patent is a judicial act which must be held to relate only to the cause of action disclosed in the plaint as presented to the <ORG> at the time of the grant that such leave which affords the very foundation of the jurisdiction is not available to confer jurisdiction in respect of a substantially different cause of action which was not judicially considered at the time it was granted that in respect of such a different cause of action leave under Clause cannot be granted after the institution of the suit and that therefore the <ORG> cannot try such a different cause of action except in another suit duly instituted It follows from this consideration that any amendment such as Mr <NAME> proposes to make in the plaint cannot be of any avail But in view of the authorities above referred to as to the nature of the order under Clause and having regard to the fact that the point is one relating not to procedure but to Jurisdiction it appears to me that that suggestion cannot be maintained After making these observations the learned <NAME> proceeded to consider the nature of the cause of action as pleaded in the original plaint and the nature of the amendment asked for and recorded the following conclusion at page I must therefore hold that in this case which is governed by Clause of the Letters Patent the leave of the <ORG> was necessary under that clause to give the <ORG> jurisdiction that the jurisdiction so conferred was confined to the cause of action disclosed in the plaint as originally framed and that the <ORG> cannot now allow an amendment which shall substantially alter that cause of action In this view it becomes unnecessary to consider whether the cause of action intended to be introduced into the suit by amendment would itself be one over which this <ORG> could exercise jurisdiction without leave granted under Clause In this case the plaintiffs who resided at Indore and carried on business in Bombay by their <ORG> sued the defendants upon Hundies which were drawn by the defendants from Sihore upon the plaintiff in Bombay in favour of several individuals and firms in Bombay The plaintiffs at the request of the defendants paid the said hundies on the defendants account and called upon the defendants for repayment but as no repayment was made the plaintiffs filed the suit after obtaining leave under Clause of the Letters Patent The defendants took up the defence that the hundies in respect of which the suit had been brought were merely Items in one account comprising a long series of transactions between the plaintiffs and the defendants and they contended that the plaintiffs are not entitled to bring a suit in respect of certain selected items in an account but must sue for the balance if any upon the whole account At the hearing of the suit the learned counsel appearing for the plaintiffs submitted that the hundies sued upon were separate transactions but if the Court accepted the case of the defendants as set up in the written statement opportunity might be given to the plaintiffs to amend the plaint In the written statement filed by the defendant It was denied that <NAME> was the owner and It was stated that the firm belonged to her son <NAME> who was then dead and who had left an Infant daughter <NAME> In consequence of these allegations in the written statement the plaintiff added <NAME> as a party defendant to the suit but no fresh leave was obtained when <NAME> was added as a party At the hearing the learned counsel appearing for the added defendant <NAME> relied on Section of the Limitation Act and contended that when <NAME> was added as a defendant the suit was to be treated as instituted against her on that date and fresh leave under Clause of the Letters Patent should have been obtained at that time But no fresh leave having been obtained the Court had no jurisdiction to entertain or try the suit so far as <NAME> was concerned At page <NAME> in dealing with this question of jurisdiction observed inter alia as follows According to the view which has been always accepted in this Court the leave required by Clause of the Letters Patent must be granted if at all at the time of the acceptance of the plaint and cannot be granted afterwards By Section of the Limitation Act the suit as regards <NAME> must be deemed to have been instituted when she was made a party There is nothing in this decision to suggest that no fresh leave could at all be granted at the time <NAME> was added as a party On the other hand the implication is that at the time <NAME> was added as a party it was open to the plaintiff to apply for such leave In this case the plaintiffs filed a suit In <ORG> on th November against the firm of <ORG> as it was constituted on the th September and the partners in the said firm on that date in respect of breach of an agreement dated the th September On nd December the plaintiffs obtained an order of amendment of the plaint and the plaint was subsequently amended by the addition of the names of Messrs Even if leave subsequent to the admission of a plaint could be given under Clause of the Letters Patent as to which I say nothing I am clearly of opinion that leave could not be given by the prothcnotary Thus the question whether a leave subsequent to the admission of a plaint can be given under Clause of the Letters Patent was left open by the learned Chief Justice <NAME> against whose order the appeal had been preferred dealt with Clause of the Letters Patent in the following manner If the leave under Clause of the Letters Patent had not been obtained and if the suit had been filed as an ordinary suit without any leave no question as to the propriety of the amendment could possibly had arisen But the difficulties have arisen only by reason of the fact that the amendments were introduced into a plaint which had been accepted under Clause of the Letters Patent So this decision does not also lay down in any definite terms that no leave under Clause of the Letters Patent can in any circumstances be granted in respect of amendments made In a suit filed with prior leave under Clause of the Letters Patent The case made in the plaint was that the defendants had given instructions to the plaintiff firm consisting of six persons as partners to effect certain transactions on his behalf the plaintiffs acted as brokers and as a result of carrying out the transactions the plaintiffs had suffered loss and they claimed the same from the defendant As the defendant was a resident of Surat it was alleged in the plaint that a part of the cause of action had arisen in Bombay and leave under Clause of the Letters Patent was obtained before the plaint was filed When the plaintiff firm took out a summoris for judgment the defendant raised the contention that he had dealings with <NAME> the individual and not with the plaintiff firm and so the firm consisting of the six persons had no cause of action against him and the suit was liable to be dismissed Thereafter an application was made for amendment of the plaint and <NAME> Choksey the individual continued the suit in his own name after consequential amendment had been made in the body of the plaint to the effect that it was <NAME> the individual who had a cause of action against the defendant At the hearing of the suit the learned counsel appearing for the defendant raised the objection that as no leave under Clause had been obtained at the time the amendment was made the <ORG> had no jurisdiction to try the suit <NAME> after referring to the decision in ILR Bom observed as follows In ILR Bom it was held that the leave granted was confined to the cause or causes of action set forward in the plaint at the time the leave was granted hence the plaint cannot be amended so as to alter the cause of action if an amendment which would alter the cause of action Is made it necessarily follows that fresh leave should be obtained in respect of the altered cause of action In the present case it seems clear to me that the cause of action alleged to exist in the six persons against the defendant for their alleged employment as brokers by him is clearly different from the alleged cause of action claimed to exist In <NAME> the individual The two causes of action being thus entirely different and no leave having been obtained when <NAME> the Individual desired to carry on the suit this Issue must be found against the plaintiff and the suit should therefore be dismissed with costs It is clear from these observations of the learned Judge of <ORG> that If an amendment is sought to be introduced in a plaint filed with leave obtained under Clause of the Letters Patent and such amendment had the effect of altering the causes of action then it was necessary to obtain fresh leave So the implication of this judgment also is that when an amendment is asked for in a suit instituted with leave under Clause of the Letters Patent it is open to the party applying for amendment to ask for fresh leave under Clause of the Letters Patent and for the <ORG> to grant such leave The Calcutta cases to which reference has been made by the learned counsel appearing for the parties may now be dealt with After the trial of the suit commenced some time in April the learned counsel for the defendant raised the question that the agreements upon which the claim was made were not binding or enforceable against the <ORG> on the ground that they were not executed by the <ORG> as required by the Act and the Rules made thereunder Subsequently both the plaint and the written statement were allowed to be amended and alternative claims made under Sections and of the Contract Act were introduced in the plaint by way of amendment The leave to amend the plaint to include these claims was given on th November Thereafter when the matter came up for further hearing the learned counsel for the defendant <ORG> raised the contention that the <ORG> had no jurisdiction to try the suit in respect of the claims introduced by way of amendment in the plaint inasmuch as fresh leave under Clause had not been obtained at the time of the amendment in the plaint which had been originally filed after obtaining leave under Clause of the Letters Patent Gentle after pointing out that the original claim was only to enforce the terms of the agreement but the claims which had been introduced by way of amendment were dehors the agreement and sought to enforce other rights referred to the decisions of the Bombay High <ORG> reported in ILR Bom and AIR Bom and after setting out the scope and Implications of those decisions held as follows In my opinion the <ORG> has no jurisdiction to receive try and determine the claims upon the causes of action In the amendment to the plaint since leave was not previously obtained in respect of those causes of action before the suit in which they are made was instituted in this <ORG> Now if the entire process of reasoning in the Judgment of the learned Judge in arriving at this conclusion is analysed the Impression that is conveyed is that according to the learned Judge an amendment to a plaint raising a new cause of action upon which a claim is made is not a fresh suit but is an additional claim made in an existing suit and it is not therefore permissible for the <ORG> to grant fresh leave under Clause and allow an amendment of the plaint at a subsequent stage of the suit After summarising the effect of the various decisions to which the attention of the learned Judge had been drawn the learned Judge at page of <ORG> at of <ORG> recorded the following propositions Where by amendment of a plaint a cause of action is altered or a new cause of action added it is not a new suit but the old suit in a new form In such a case no amendment can be ordered if it requires leave to be granted under Clause of the Letters Patent at the time of the amendment It follows that leave under Clause of the Letters Patent cannot be granted in such a case at any stage after the institution of the original suit In the case of <NAME> Debi Prosad Shaw LJ Mitter after dealing with the decision of <ORG> and the argument of hardship put forward by the learned counsel for the plaintiff observed as follows pages I agree that hardship may be caused to the plaintiff in these circumstances but I see no reason why I should differ from the judgment of Gentle <NAME> which I have quoted as also from the judgment of Kania <NAME> of <ORG> in AIR Bom once the cause of action is altered or added to it cannot in my opinion be said that the reception of the suit continues to be proper without the grant of fresh leave The last part of the observation of the learned Judge without the grant of fresh leave seems to indicate that fresh leave subsequent to the institution of the suit can be granted for the purpose of introducing an amendment to the plaint and if no such fresh leave is granted at the time of the amendment the reception of the suit although proper at the time of the institution of the suit ceases to be so and becomes improper by reason of no fresh leave having been obtained in respect of the amendment introduced in the plaint This very point also came up for consideration in an unreported decision of <NAME> in suit No of Ramballav Rameshwar <NAME> judgment Cal It is contended that there was no change in the cause of action Even so if new parties are joined against whom it is intended to proceed In the suit and to obtain a decree the obtaining of the leave is imperative because it is the foundation of the jurisdiction of the <ORG> The <ORG> gets jurisdiction to decide the suit against parties only if it grants leave which is a condition precedent No leave was obtained to proceed against the only added defendants and it follows that the <ORG> never got any jurisdiction to make any decree or order against them in the suit Relying on this observation and also analysing the Bombay and Calcutta decisions referred to in his judgment the learned Judge has come to the conclusion that under certain circumstances fresh leave under Clause of the Letters Patent can be granted in respect of an amendment introduced at a stage subsequent to the filing of the suit which is instituted after obtaining prior leave under Clause of the Letters Patent In the last mentioned case where a person was added as defendant at his own instance to a suit filed after obtaining leave under Clause it was held by the learned Judge that no fresh leave was necessary The power of the <ORG> to deal with matters of amendment of pleadings for determining the real question in controversy between the parties is derived from the Code of Civil Procedure But as in cases where part only of the cause of action arises within jurisdiction or part only of the land is within jurisdiction the obtaining of the leave of the <ORG> is made a condition precedent to the <ORG> assuming or acquiring Jurisdiction the judicial decisions have laid down that any substantial or material addition to or alteration of the cause of action as pleaded in the original plaint is dependent on obtaining of prior leave of the <ORG> inasmuth as the question of amendment and the question of jurisdiction are inextricably linked up in such cases It appears to me that this view accords with reason and common sense and the decisions which hold that leave under Clause can be granted by the <ORG> only once at the time of the institution of the suit and no amendment at all can be allowed of any plaint filed with the leave of the <ORG> have put a wrong construction on the language used in Clause The proposed amendment seeks to set forth certain anterior events which have close relation to and are connected with the subject matter of the original suit The only other question which has been raised in this appeal is whether an appeal lies from the order allowing the amendment and granting fresh leave under Clause of the Letters Patent Because by a mere order allowing certain amendments or some new grounds of claim to be raised in the pleadings there is no determination of ihe rights of the parties on any question between them It is however clear that the order for amendment as made in the present case does not in any way deal with the jurisdiction of the <ORG> or affect its jurisdiction It proceeds on the assumption that the <ORG> has the jurisdiction in a suit pending before it to order amendment of pleadings All that Order Rule provides is the mode in which the <ORG> should exercise that jurisdiction This view has found favour with this court So if the order appealed against in the present case would have been an order of amendment pure and simple this Court would have been inclined to take the view that no appeal lay from such an order It was held in the case of <NAME> <NAME> Mad HCR that an appeal lies from the decision of a judge exercising Original Jurisdiction refusing to give leave to institute a suit on the Original Side of the High <ORG> in a case in which the cause of acton has arisen in part within the Ordinary Original Jurisdiction of the High <ORG> In the case of <NAME> <NAME> Mad HCR an appeal from an order granting leave under Clause of the Letters Patent by a learned judge of <ORG> after another learned Judge of co ordinate jurisdiction had refused leave in respect of substantially the same cause of action was entertained by <ORG> and the order was set aside as being irregular and an abuse of the process of the <ORG> It is to be noted that no objection was raised in that case as to the competency of the appeal An appeal was taken against the order and the question of maintainability of the appeal was raised before <ORG> The learned Chief Justice Sir <NAME> in dealing with the question of competency of the appeal observed It was held by <ORG> at Madras in Mad HCR that an order made under this clause of the Charter was subject to appeal We may not agree in all the reasons which the learned Judges of that <ORG> gave for their decision but we do agree in the conclusion that this is an appealable order It is not a mere formal order or an order merely regulating the procedure in the suit but one that has the effect of giving a jurisdiction to the <ORG> which it otherwise would not have and it may fairly be said to determine some right between them namely the right to sue in a particular <ORG> and to compel the defendants who are not within its jurisdiction to come in and defend the suit or if they do not to make them liable to have a decree passed against them in their absence These observations of the learned Chief Justice make ft abundantly clear that an order made under Clause of the Letters Patent is subject to appeal inasmuch as it is not an order merely regulating the procedure of the suit but one which affects the jurisdiction of the <ORG> So when the question of amendment of the pleading and the question of leave under Clause of the Letters Patent are inter connected or in other words when the question of procedure and the question of jurisdiction are mixed up and one cannot be dissociated from the other the order dealing with such question of procedure and jurisdiction is in my view an appealable order and it is a judgment within the meaning of Clause of the Letters Patent Thus there is a Bench Decision of this Court in which an order refusing to rescind a leave under Clause has been held to be a judgment and as such appealable under Clause of the Letters Patent and as In my view there is no difference between an order refusing to rescind a leave under Clause and an order granting leave under Clause I am at a loss to understand why the order made in the present case granting fresh leave in respect of the amendment asked for cannot be said to be a judgment from which an appeal lies under Clause of the Letters Patent I hold that the order appealed from is a judgment within the meaning of Clause of the Letters Patent and as such the objection as to the maintainability of the appeal must be overruled But in view of my finding that the order of <ORG> is right this appeal must fall and it is accordingly dismissed with costs The operation of the order of <NAME> dated the th March will remain stayed till the th January I agree in the conclusion reached by my Lord the Chief Justice that the appeal should be dismissed but I do so on somewhat different grounds Two questions have in the main been debated in this appeal First whether in a suit brought with the leave of the court under Clause of the Letters Patent amendment of pleadings Is at all allowable and if so whether fresh leave Is required secondly whether the order giving such leave is appealable The plaintiffs a firm of Commission Agents Instituted the suit against the defendants for a decree for a certain sum of money in the alternative a claim for accounts without disturbing settled accounts was made end a decree for such sum as may be found due on taking accounts was prayed for The plaintiff firm alleged that part of the cause of action had arisen within the original jurisdiction of this Court and consequently asked for leave under Clause to Institute the suit The learned trial Judge heard the parties on the proposed amendments and gave leave again with liberty to the defendants to file an additional written statement the cause of action shall have arisen either wholly or in case leave of the court shall have been first obtained in part within the local limits of the ordinary original jurisdiction of the said <ORG> It is plain from the language employed that where only a part of the cause of action has arisen within jurisdiction <ORG> has first to give leave in order to receive try and determine the suit The leave has la be given at the time of admission of the plaint and cannot be granted afterwards The courts have gone further and held that the decision to give leave or to withhold it is a judicial act and the order giving leave or refusing it is subject to appeal That was the view taken as long ago as in the case of Mad HCR where it was held that a Judge exercising discretion vested in him by Clause of the Charter upon an ex parte application lor leave to bring a suit acts judicially and his decision is a judgment subject to appeal under Clause The order made under Clause was accordingly held appealable on the footing that it was not a formal order or an order merely regulating procedure in the suit but one which has the effect of giving jurisdiction to the court which it otherwise would not have It was explained that a decision giving leave or withholding it amounts to a determination of some right between the parties namely the right to sue in a particular court and to compel the defendants who are not within its jurisdiction to come In and defend the suit or if they do not to make themselves liable to have a decree made against them in their absence This position was reaffirmed in a <ORG> decision of this <ORG> of <NAME> <NAME> ILR Cal where <NAME> held on a consideration of the relevant authorities that the order granting leave to sue under Clause of the Letters Patent Is a judicial and not merely a procedural or administrative act the leave has to be granted by a Judge of the <ORG> and it is not competent for the court to delegate this function to one of its officers The leave given creates jurisdiction which determines a right between the parties namely the right to sue in a particular court <ORG> held in the case of that leave granted under Clause constitutes the very foundation of the suit which is instituted on Its basis It seems clear that the leave contemplated In Clause of the Letters Patent must be given before a suit in which the cause of action has arisen partly within jurisdiction can be received tried and determined by <ORG> on its Original Side Such leave has to be expressly given and cannot be inferred from the mere fact that the suit has been allowed to go on where only a part of the cause of action has arisen within jurisdiction If such Is the position the question then arises whether amendment of pleadings can be allowed in a suit brought with leave under Clause There is no provision in the Letters Patent providing for leave to be given again to amend the pleadings It is therefore for consideration whether any amendment of pleadings can at all be allowed in such suit and if allowed whether fresh leave is required for such amendment It authorises <ORG> to make rules and orders for the purpose of regulating all proceedings in civil actions which may be brought before it and says that <ORG> shall be guided in making such rules and orders as far as possible by the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure or of any law by which the Code may be altered or amended by competent legislative authority Order of the Code deals with pleadings generally and provides that the <ORG> may at any stage of the proceedings allow either party to alter or amend his pleadings in such manner and on such terms as may be just and ail such amendments shall be made as may be necessary for the purpose of determining the real questions In controversy between the parties The Letters Patent Itself enjoins reference to the Civil Procedure Code for guidance in the matter of rules to be framed by the <ORG> for regulating its own procedure The result is that there is nothing either in the Letters Patent or In the Code which prevents application of the rules relating to pleadings contained in Orders Prima facie it seems right to hold that amendment of pleadings can be allowed in suits brought with leave under Clause The contention on behalf of the appellants has been that no amendment of pleadings can be allowed In such suits for the reason that amendments have the effect of altering or adding to the original cause of action upon which leave under Clause was asked for and obtained The argument is that the very notion of amendment is repelled by the condition prescribed in Clause which requires the Judge to give leave first and then to receive try and determine the suit I agree leave which confers jurisdiction cannot be given piecemeal leave once given is given for trial to a close and cannot be repeated The Judge when giving leave exercises his judicial mind on the facts making up the cause of action originally stated in the plaint Broadly speaking the notion of fresh leave appears to be abhorrent to the concept of leave in Clause since such leave constitutes the very foundation of jurisdiction and jurisdiction cannot be created or conferred in instalment A concession has however been made on behalf of the appellants that if any amendment does not entail substantial alteration of the cause of action the amendment may be allowed even in such suits The argument has been sought to be reinforced by a decision of <ORG> in the case of ILR Bom where Telang held on reference to the authorities that since leave tinder Clause is a judicial act which must be held to relate only to the cause of action disclosed in the plaint as presented to the <ORG> at the time of the grant of such leave no amendment of pleadings can be allowed The learned Judge felt pressed by the weight of judicial opinion to hold that since the leave affords the very foundation of the <ORG> power to deal with the dispute it is not available to confer jurisdiction in respect of a substantially different cause of action which was not judicially considered at the time the leave was granted This view has found favour with <NAME> in the case of AIR Cal who also held that leave under Clause being a condition precedent to jurisdiction to receive try and determine the claims contained in the plaint the <ORG> has no jurisdiction to determine other claims founded upon causes of action in the amendment on the ground that leave had not previously been obtained in respect of the amended pleadings In my opinion these decisions proceed on the assumption that every amendment necessarily implies a complete change of cause of action As is well known a cause of action means every fact which if traversed it would be necessary for the plaintiff to prove In order to support his right to entitle him to a decree it includes everything which if not proved would entitle the defendants to an immediate judgment it is a bundle of essential facts set forth in the plaint and those facts are the media upon which the plaintiff asks the <ORG> to pronounce in his favour The Letters Patent itself refers to cause of action arising wholly or in part within jurisdiction As <NAME> <NAME> aptly observed in the case of Mad HCR that the words cause of action may have either the restricted sense of immediate occasion of the action or the wider sense of necessary conditions of its maintenance It seems plain that several facts pleaded upon which the claim to relief is founded may well have ancillary facts which are more or less of a subsidiary or explanatory in character Where therefore an amendment of the pleadings does not introduce an altogether new set of facts which changes beyond recognition the original cause of action there cannot possibly be any objection to such amendment being allowed in a suit brought with leave under Clause of the Letters Patent There are circumstances where such joinder is forbidden but where within the limits prescribed several causes of action are Joined which do not bring about multifariousness joinder is permissible and the suit may well proceed to judgment Such amendments have of course to be necessary for the purpose of determining the real question in controversy between the parties It was held that although the power of the <ORG> to amend the plaint in a suit should not be exercised where the effect is to take away from the defendant a legal right which has accrued to him by lapse of time still there are cases in which that consideration is outweighed by the special circumstances of the case in which that <ORG> gave leave to amend the plaint even at that stage by allowing an alternative claim for damages for breach of contract for non delivery of goads despite the respondent opposition It was held that interests of justice required that the amendment should be allowed even though a suit on the amended cause of action was barred by limitation There can be no question of leave being given to amendments which are by the very nature of things mere additions or alterations to the pleadings in the suit The leave spoken of in Clause gives jurisdiction to receive and determine the suit Under the general law regulating amendments of pleadings the <ORG> may give leave to amendments being made to pleadings but such leave controlled and guided by Orders Rule has nothing to do with the leave under Clause which when obtained enables the party to commence the suit When the <ORG> allows an amendment it proceeds on the basis that the <ORG> has jurisdiction to try the suit and regulate its Rule only provides the mode in which the <ORG> should exercise jurisdiction which it possesses Procedure becomes relevant only when there is jurisdiction to regulate it the former is merely the machinery to reach a decision which the latter conditions and authorises If such is the result there can be no question of leave being granted to an amendment of pleadings under Clause of the Letters Patent If the proposed amendment is not allowable by reason of its being wholly inept or unnecessary for the purpose of determining the real question in controversy between the parties it is bound to be disallowed That disallowance takes place in the exercise of the <ORG> discretion given to it by Orders Rule It can have nothing to do with jurisdiction contemplated in Clause of the Letters Patent In the course of the trial the dispute may take on new aspects in consequence of the amendment allowed but being an amendment it must be assumed to have gassed the initial iest that it is related to the main cause of action and necessary to enable the <ORG> to determine the real question in controversy over which the <ORG> has already assumed jurisdiction by reason of the leave given under Clause I cannot conceive that the right of amendment which is a valued right is denied to a suitor who has asked for and obtained leave in terms of Clause Amendments are made in the course of the trial but the trial cannot commence until there is already jurisdiction in the court and once jurisdiction is there to try the action the amendments are assimilated to the main pleading upon which leave to receive try and determine the suit was had and obtained Where for the purpose of addition of parties an amendment is introduced it has necessarily the effect of enlarging the scope of the suit The <ORG> jurisdiction has to be related to the cause of action as much as to the parties to be affected by its decision An order made or decree passed in the suit would not have affected him if he was not a party to it In such a case it must be held that when the <ORG> acquires jurisdiction upon such added party there has to be leave given under Clause so as to make him amenable to the <ORG> jurisdiction For the party thus added the suit commences when he is brought on the record But before the <ORG> can exercise jurisdiction over him there has to be leave given in so far as he is concerned That seems to be the position in view of Section of the Limitation Act which says that where after the institution of a suit a new plaintiff or defendant is substituted or added the suit shall as regards him be deemed to have been instituted when he is made a party This view was accepted in the case of Cal LJ where <NAME> who spoke for the <ORG> held that leave has to be obtained for the addition of parties although the suit has been commenced with leave already obtained under Clause This view accords with the principle that leave once given under Clause enures and no farther leave is required or can be given when amendments to pleadings have been allowed by the <ORG> Leave repeated under Clause in the course of the suit seems to be repelled by the clause itself except upon addition of party when leave becomes imperative since the <ORG> then acquires for the first time jurisdiction over him In all other cases amendments when allowed merely adhere to the original cause of action upon which the Judge mind was exercised when he decided judicially to receive try end determine the suit I am inclined to agree with the view taken by <NAME> in the case of that where by amendment of plaint a cause of action is added it is not a new suit but the old suit in a new form If by new form the learned Judge meant that it is the old suit with certain facts added to the original cause of action I should have no difficulty in accepting his conclusion As I understand it no amendment can be allowed under the rules of pleading if it is of such a character as to alter completely the nature of the original cause of action and make leave under Clause imperative I agree that where a new party is added the suit as regards the added party must be deemed to have been commenced on the date he is brought into the proceedings in such case it is necessary to grant leave under Clause in order that the <ORG> may assume jurisdiction ever such added party This was a suit brought with leave but it was held on appeal that the leave was unnecessary The cause of action which was a right to sue vested in six persons in that case was held as being not the same as the right which existed in an individual when therefore that individual desired to carry on the suit without the leave first had and obtained the learned Judge thought that the suit deserved to be dismissed In the case of Cal LJ <ORG> accepted the view expressed by <ORG> in the case of <ORG> but added that once the cause of action was altered it could not be said that the reception of the suit continued to be proper without the grant of fresh leave The learned Judge repelled the contention that amendments ought to be allowed in suits brought with leave to prevent hardship and held that a suitor who sought to take advantage of Clause cannot be heard to complain if through his own default he omitted to include a ground of relief which was available to him at the time of the institution of the suit I am unable to agree that there is such a thing as fresh leave The leave is the initial thing and when a party is added and leave given it is also the initial leave so far as he is concerned When the <ORG> is once seized of the suit it is seized for all purposes and it can allow an amendment provided it is necessary for determining the controversy between the parties Mallick <NAME> had occasion to deal with the question in a slightly different form in the case of in which the learned Judge referred to an earlier decision of his and expressed the view that in a suit for land partly situate within jurisdiction which required leave to be obtained under Clause of the Letters Patent fresh leave for amendment was not necessary if the plaint was subsequently amended But this statement has to be taken with a qualification since the new cause of action related to land situate wholly within jurisdiction the facts of the case did not quite clinch the issue as to whether fresh leave was necessary consequent upon an amendment For the reasons given I am unable to accept the view that fresh leave can be given to amended pleadings even though they do not involve addition of parties There is nothing in the Letters Patent which will encourage the view that in a suit brought with leave under Clause the suitor is to be deprived of the right to amend his pleading where such amendment can be properly allowed In my view he has that right within the limits of Order Rule This is essentially a procedural right which has nothing to do with jurisdiction which leave under Clause confers The other main question debated relates to the appealability of an order giving leave to amend the pleading An order giving leave or refusing leave under Clause or even refusing to rescind the leave given has been held to be appealable under Clause of the Letters Patent In Mad HCR the decision proceeds on the footing that an appeal lies from the decision of a Judge exercising original jurisdiction refusing to give leave to institute a suit in which the cause of action has arisen In part within the ordinary original jurisdiction of <ORG> The decisions have turned on the construction put upon the word Judgment under Clause and it has generally been held that the word judgment must be taken to mean a decision which determines some liability affecting the merits of the controversy between the parties It is unnecessary in the present case to elaborate this aspect of the matter since the immediate question before us is one of appeal from an order allowing an amendment But the question may arise in another form If an amendment requires fresh leave under Clause the order granting such leave or refusing it may attract a right of appeal In the view I have taken amendments properly allowed under Rule of Orders being entirely a matter of procedure does not relate to jurisdiction and consequently no question arises of an order permitting or refusing such amendments being held appealable But even then it may perhaps be argued that such order amounts to a decision affecting the rights of a suitor A distinction was made between controversy regarding rights to the subject matter of the suit and controversy about the ground upon which such rights are asserted or denied Where a plaint is properly allowed to be amended it merely means that the plaintiff has been permitted to include a new ground of relief an order permitting such amendment decides nothing affects no rights and curtails no claim of the defendant to challenge the new ground The effect of such an order is merely that the plaintiff is allowed to make a claim and it does not mean that the claim has been rightly made It has accordingly been held that the order permitting amendment is merely an order regulating procedure of the court regarding the manner in which the parties will state their cases with the consequence that no substantive rights are thereby affected The learned Chief Justice pointed out that if substantive rights which are the rights in controversy between the parties to the suit are not affected by an order permitting an amendment such order cannot amount to a judgment and therefore cannot be held to be appealable It was therefore held that ai order allowing an amendment of the written statement to raise the plea that the suit was barred by limitation and that the plaintiff was not entitled to succeed on the ground of adverse possession was not Judgment within the meaning of Clause of the Letters Patent and was therefore not appealable I respectfully agree with this view An order of amendment of pleadings is not by Itself appealable and in my opinion no question of leave under Clause of the Letters Patent arises in suth case since leave under that clause being a matter of jurisdiction Involves decision of some kind affecting the merits of the controversy But amendment of pleadings being entirely procedural an order allowing or refusing it decides nothing does not affect the merits of the controversy and is consequently not appealable except where jurisdiction is assumed over added parties by leave being given under Clause of the Letters Patent I would therefore dismiss the appeal
