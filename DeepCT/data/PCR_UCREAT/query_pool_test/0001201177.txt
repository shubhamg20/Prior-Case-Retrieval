The appeal is against an order of the Subordinate Judge of Ottapalam remanding a suit to the District Munsiff of Chowghat for disposal on the merits The suit was filed by the first respondent for eviction of the appellant first defendant from a building that had been leased to him by the first respondent predecessor in There were also prayers for arrears of rent and for recovery of damages in respect of an annexe to the building constructed by the first respondent the District Munsiff held that the suit so far as it related to eviction was not maintainable because of the provisions of the Madras Non Residential Buildings Rent Control Order hereinafter referred to as the Rent Control Order The relevant provision of the Rent Control Order is Clause the material portions of which are as follows i A tenant in possession of a non residential building shall not be evicted therefrom whether in execution of a decree or otherwise and whether before or after the termination of the tenancy except in accordance with the provisions of this clause A landlord wishing to evict a tenant in possession shall apply to the Controller for a direction in that behalf The Controller shall make an order of eviction only if he is satisfied that one or other of the conditions mentioned is satisfied Before dealing with the several decisions on the effect of this clause let us examine its plain language Sub clause lays down that a tenant shall not be evicted from a non residential building of which he is in possession There is nothing in this clause or in any of the other clauses of the Order expressly prohibiting the institution of a suit for possession or prohibiting <ORG> from passing a decree for possession Is there any such prohibition which can be necessarily implied Is there anything in this clause which takes away by necessary intendment the ordinary jurisdiction of <ORG> to entertain a suit by a landlord for recovery of possession of his property in the occupation of a tenant I A I Mad where the learned Judge held that there was an ouster of the jurisdiction of Civil Courts His reasoning was as follows Mr <NAME> ingeniously contended that there could be no objection to a decree being passed in this suit though after the decree it might be that he might have to go before the Controller to get possession This argument fails to take note of two answers One is that when a special tribunal is indicated for obtaining a particular relief it is that tribunal that has got exclusive jurisdiction to grant that relief and to that extent the jurisdiction of Civil Courts is ousted Secondly even if it is held that the Court has jurisdiction to grant a decree for eviction it cannot be called upon to indulge in a mere pastime and pass orders which would be brutum fulmen and which cannot be carried into effect without resort being had to other persons or tribunals in whom a discretion is vested to decide if eviction is to be ordered or not Neither of the two grounds on which the learned Judge based his conclusion commends itself to me No doubt when a special tribunal is indicated for obtaining a particular relief that tribunal has got exclusive jurisdiction to grant that relief That may only mean that a <ORG> which passed the decree may not have jurisdiction to execute the decree for possession But I fail to see how the jurisdiction of the Civil <ORG> to entertain a suit and to pass a decree for possession is necessarily ousted But that fact has never been understood to mean that there is an implied ouster of jurisdiction of the <ORG> to entertain and dispose of the suit He held that the language was not such as to deprive the Civil <ORG> of their power to entertain suits for eviction and to adjudicate upon them His conclusion is thus tersely expressed It cannot be said that these words are wide enough to deprive <ORG> of their jurisdiction to pass decrees all that the rule contemplates is the control of the relief of eviction It must now be taken to be well settled that a decree in ejectment could be passed by <ORG> and all that the order provides is that during the subsistence of the order <ORG> cannot execute the decree but the landlord will have to take appropriate steps under the provisions of the order There are certain general considerations which in our opinion support this view namely that the order does not take away the jurisdiction of <ORG> to entertain a suit by a landlord against the tenant and pass a decree therein for possession The order itself is only for a short duration and when it is repealed or it expires a decree of <ORG> can be executed in the ordinary way immediately I hereafter Having regard to all these considerations and to the language of Clause of the order I am of opinion that the jurisdiction of <ORG> to entertain and pass a decree in a suit for eviction by a landlord against his tenant is not expressly or impliedly taken away by the provisions of the Rent Control Order I respectfully agree with my Lord in his reasoning as well as in his conclusion that even if it is held that the Court has jurisdiction to grant a decree for eviction it cannot be called upon to indulge in a mere pastime and pass orders which would be brutum fulmen The observation of Lord <NAME> that It would be an inconvenient state of the law if it were found necessary for a man to institute a perfectly vain litigation under peril of losing his property if he does not was made in connection with the discussion of a question of limitation which arose in the case before their Lordships of <ORG> and has since been considered in a number of later decisions of <ORG> in India According to the interpretation placed upon that observation of the learned Lord by these later decisions it will be too much for any litigant to contend that where the rights as between himself and his adversary have been subjected to adjudication by a competent <ORG> limitation for other suits between the parties based on such rights should be computed from the date of their final determination It has been further ruled by these later decisions of <ORG> as well as by decisions of <ORG> that Courts have in fact no power on considerations of hardship or equity to invent new grounds of exemption from the bar of limitation not recognised by the statute It seems to me therefore that the principles laid down by these decisions are a fortiori applicable to a question of limitation which may arise as pointed out by <NAME> in his unreported decision in A No of in relation to a suit in the ordinary <ORG> based on grounds of eviction under the general law which are by no means identical with the grounds constituting the cause of action for an application to the Controller
