but the appellants filed writ petitions claiming refund of the remainder of the licence fee paid by them During the pendency of the writ petitions the Kerala Luxury Tax on Tobacco Validation Act of Act of was passed by the <ORG> legislature to provide for the levy of a luxury tax on tobacco and validate the levy and collection of fees for licences for the vend and stocking of tobacco for the period between August and December and it received the assent of the President The appellants then challenged the validity of the Act but the <ORG> on the other hand demanded payment of the part of the fee earlier refunded to the parties The validity of the demand notice was questioned by the appellants on the question of validity of the Act <ORG> held that the levy being in respect of goods produced outside the <ORG> was not an excise duty falling within Entry of the Union List the tax clearly answers the description of luxury tax falling within entry of <ORG> List however the payment of the tax being a condition precedent to the bringing of the goods into the taxing territory it was a direct impediment on the free flow of goods and even so it is saved by Article being reason able tax levied in public interest What was held in that case was that the Cochin Tobacco Act and the similar Travancore Act taken along with the rules framed under those Acts were in substance law corresponding to the Central Excise and Salt Act The Cochin Tobacco Act and the similar Travancore Act stood repealed on April and there would be no power in the <ORG> Government thereafter to frame new rules in August and January for there would be no law to support the new rules a The argument that the provisions of the Act fell under Entry of List I of the Seventh Schedule is bereft of force The liability to pay the tax is on stocking and vending of tobacco There is no provision in the Act which is concerned with production or manufacture of tobacco or which links the tax under its provisions with the manufacture or production of tobacco Excise duty is a tax on articles produced or manufactured in the taxing country Generally speaking the tax is on the manufacturer or producer yet laws are to be found which impose a duty of excise at stages subsequent to the manufacture or production Where however the levy imposed or tax has no nexus with the manufacture or production of an article the impost or tax cannot be regarded to be one in the nature of excise duty The word luxury has not been used in the sense of something pertaining to the exclusive preserve of the rich There is nothing static about what constitutes an article of luxury A number of factors may have to be taken into account in adjudging the commodity as an article of luxury But while the <ORG> can impose restrictions on the freedom of trade commerce or intercourse between one <ORG> and another or within any part of the territory of India as may be required in the public interest so far as the <ORG> legislatures are concerned restrictions must satisfy two requirements firstly they must be in public interest and secondly the restrictions should be reasonable AB a Where a topic is not included within the relevant List dealing with the legislative competence of <ORG> <ORG> by making a law cannot attempt to confer such legislative competence on the State legislatures This principle would however have no application where what is sought to be done is to validate the recovery of licence fee for stocking and vending of tobacco The impugned provisions have nothing to do with the production and manufacture of tobacco Where a challenge to the validity of a legal enactment is made on the ground that it is a colourable piece of legislation what is to be proved is that though the Act ostensibly is within the legislative competence of the legislature in substance and reality it covers a field which is outside its legislative competence In the present case in enacting the impugned provisions the <ORG> legislature has exercised power of levying luxury tax in the shape of licence fee on the vend and stocking of tobacco The only conditions are that the levy should be of a nature which can answer to the description of luxury tax and that the State legislature should be competent to enact a law for recovery of luxury tax FG a Where the State legislature can make valid law it can provide not only for the prospective operation of the material provisions of the law but can also provide for the retrospective operation of the provisions In judging the reasonableness of the retrospective operation of law for the purpose of Article the test of length of time covered by the retrospective operation could not by itself be treated as decisive A It is not correct to say that the legislation should be held to be invalid because its retrospective operation might operate harshly in some cases If a provision regarding the levy of luxury tax is within the competence of the State legislature the said legislature would be well within its competence to enact a law for recovery of an amount which though already refunded to a party partakes of the nature of a luxury tax in the light of that law The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> Whether the provisions of the Luxury Tax on Tobacco Validation Act Act of hereinafter referred to as the Act enacted by <ORG> are void on the grounds that <ORG> lacked the legislative competence to enac that Act and the provisions of the Act contravened article of the Constitution and were not protected by article is the main question which arises for determination in these civil appeals Nos and to filed on certificate against the judgment of <ORG> A Division Bench of <ORG> has up held the validity of the Act Learned counsel for the parties are agreed that it is not necessary to set out the facts of the other cases and that the decision in the above two appeals would also govern those other cases Section of that Act prohibited the transport import or export sale and cultivation of tobacco except as permitted by the Act and the rules framed thereunder In pursuance of the power given by that Act the Diwan of Cochin made rules relating to matters specified in the Act Under the rules it became necessary to obtain a licence for cultivation of tobacco plant The system which was in force for the collection of tobacco revenue up to August was to auction what were called A class and class shops In addition there were class shops the licence for which was granted either on the recommendation of or in consultation with class licensees On April after the Constitution had come in force and Travancore Cochin had become a Part State Finance Act No Section of the Finance Act provided that if immediately before the st lay of April there is in force in any State other than Jammu and Kashmir a law corresponding to but other than an Act referred to in sub sections or of section such law is hereby repealed with effect from the said date In consequence of this provision in SCI Finance Act the rules which were in force on April were changed in the Cochin area by notification dated August and the system of auction sales of A class and class shops was done away with and instead graded licence fees were introduced for various classes of licensees including class licensees Similar change was made for the Travancore area In the appellants who were A class licensees filed writ petitions in <ORG> for refund of the licence fee collected from them on the ground that the Cochin and Travancore Tobacco Acts stood repealed by the Finance Act of because of the extension of the Central <ORG>s and Salt Act to Part State of Travancore Cochin The petitions were opposed on behalf of the State and it was contended that the Cochin Act or the similar Travancore Act did not stand repealed from April It was urged that the State was competent to frame new rules under the Cochin Tobacco Act and the corresponding Travancore Act It was further stated that the tax in question could be validly levied under entry or of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution <ORG> dismissed the petitions holding that the laws under which the new rules were framed were in force and were valid under entry of List II of the Seventh Schedule The appellants then came up in appeal to this Court It was held by this Court in its judgment dated January reported in Supp SCR that the Cochin Tobacco Act of and the rules framed thereunder as also similar provisions in Travancore requiring licences to be taken out for storage and sale of tobacco and for payment of licence fee in respect thereof were law corresponding to the provisions of the Central <ORG>s and Salt Act and hence stood repealed on April by virtue of section of the Finance Act After the above decision of this Court the appellants made a demand to the respondent State that the amounts of Rs On July the appellants filed original petition No of in <ORG> for issue of a writ to the respondent State to pay the balance amount of Rs which along with interest came to Rs During the pendency of the above petition on December the Governor of Kerala promulgated ordinance No of which was later replaced by Kerala Luxury Tax on Tobacco Validation Act of Act of This Act received the assent of the President on March In the meanwhile on January demand was made in view of the ordinance by <ORG> calling upon the appellants to pay the amount of Rs Original petition No of was filed by the appellants in <ORG> to challenge the validity of demand notice dated January as also the vires of the Act The preamble of the Act reads as under PREAMBLE WHEREAS it is expedient to provide for the levy of a luxury tax on tobacco for the period beginning with the th day of August and ending on the st day of December and the validation of the levy and collection of fees for licences for the vend and stocking of tobacco for the aforesaid period BE it enacted in the Fifteenth Year of the Republic of India as follows Section ii of the Act defines tobacco to include leaf of the tobacco plant snuff cigars cigarettes beedies beedi tobacco tobacco powder and other preparations or admixtures of tobacco Section is the charging section and provides that for the period beginning with the th day of August and ending on the st day of December every person vending or stocking tobacco within any area to which this Act extends shall be liable and shall be deemed always to have been liable to pay a luxury tax on such tobacco in the form of a fee for licence for the vend and stocking of the tobacco at such rates as may be prescribed not exceeding the rates specified in the Schedule Section of the Act gives power to <ORG> to make rules by publication in the gazette to carry out the purposes of the Act According to sub section of section of the Act the rules and notifications specified below purported to have been issued under the Tobacco Act of Travancor Act of or the Cochin Tobacco Act VII of as the case may be in so far as they relate or purport to relate to the levy and collection of fees for licences for the vend and stocking of tobacco shall be deemed to be rules issued under this section and shall be deemed to have been in force at all material times Validation Notwithstanding any judgment decree or order of any court all fees for licences for the vend or stocking of tobacco levied or collected or purported to have been levied or collected under any of the rules or notifications specified in sub section or for the period beginning with the th day of August and ending on the st day of December shall be deemed to have been validly levied or collected in accordance with law as if this Act were in force on and from the th day of August and the fees for licences were a luxury tax on tobacco levied under the provisions of this Act and accordingly a no suit or other proceeding shall be maintained or continued in any court for the refund of any fees paid or purported to have been paid under any of the said rules or notifications and no court small enforce a decree or order directing the refund of any fees paid or purported to have been paid under any of the said rules or notifications Recovery of licence fees refunded Where any amount paid or purported to have been paid as a fee for licence under any of the rules or notifications specified in sub section of has been refunded after the th day of January and such amount would not have been liable to be refunded if this Act had been in force on date of the refund the person to whom the refund was made shall pay the amount so refunded to the credit of the <ORG> in any <ORG> treasury on or before the th day of April and where such amount is not so paid the amount may be recovered from him as an arrear of land revenue under the Revenue Recovery Act for the time being in force According to the appellants the label given to the tax imposed by the charging section was only a cloak to disguise its real nature of being an excise duty In the meanwhile a single Judge of <ORG> dismissed on July original petition No of which had been filed by the appellants The appellants thereupon filed appeal before <ORG> of <ORG> against the judgment of the learned single Judge The State of Kerala thereafter came up in appeal to this <ORG> It was held that only such restrictions or impediments which directly and immediately impeded the free flow of trade commerce and intercourse fell within the prohibition imposed by article This <ORG> further observed that unless <ORG> first came to the finding whether or not there was the infringement of the guarantee under article of the Constitution the further question as to whether the statute was saved under article did not arise The case was accordingly sent back to <ORG> with the direction to take further affidavits in the matter After remand affidavits were filed on behalf of the appellants and the respondent State It clearly answers the description of luxury tax falling within entry of the State List There being no competing internal goods the mere fact that the levy is only on imported goods can only have like any other tax the economic effect of reducing the demand by reason of increasing the price The consequent diminution in the quantity of goods imported into the taxing territory is too remote an effect to be a direct impediment to the free flow of trade offending article of the constitution Even assuming that the levy offends article it is saved by article being a reasonable tax levied in the public interest the condition in the proviso thereto being satisfied by the assent of the President in view of article On behalf of the appellants their learned counsel Mr <NAME> has at the outset contended that the question as to whether the levy of the licence fee upon the appellants constitutes excise duty is concluded by the decision of this Court of January and the same operates as res judicata As against that Mr <NAME> on behalf of the respondent State submits that the question decided by this Court on January was different from that which arises in these appeals and that the said decision does not operate as res judicata So far as the rules are concerned which were issued on August and January this Court held that as the parent Acts under which those rules were issued stood repealed on April there would be no power in the State Government thereafter to frame new rules in August and January for there would be no law to support the new rules The above question does not arise for determination in these appeals before us No question relating to the validity of the above mentioned Act in the very nature of things could arise at the time of the earlier decision in It has next been argued on behalf of the appellants that the levy for the licence fee for stocking and vending of tobacco even though described as luxury tax in charging section of the Act is in reality and substance an excise duty on tobacco Excise duty it is now well settled is a tax on articles produced or manufactured in the taxing country Generally speaking the tax is on the manufacturer or the producer yet laws are to be found which impose a duty of excise at stages subsequent to the manufacture or production see of the judgment of this Court delivered on January in the case between these very parties reported in Supp Where however the levy imposed or tax has no nexus with the manufacture or production of an article the impost or tax cannot be regarded to be one in the nature of excise duty In the light of what has been stated above we may now turn to the provisions of the impugned Act of There is no provision of this Act which is concerned with production or manufacture of tobacco or which links the tax under its provisions with the manufacture or production of tobacco The same is the position of the rules issued on August and January and Mr <NAME> on behalf of the appellants has frankly conceded that those rules are in no way concerned with the production or manufacture of tobacco Argument that the provisions of the Act fall under entry of List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution must therefore be held to be bereft of force The next argument which has been advanced on behalf of the appellants is that the tax on the vending and stocking of tobacco cannot be considered to be luxury tax as contemplated by entry of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution According to that entry <ORG> can make laws in respect of taxes on luxuries including taxes on entertainments amusements betting and gambling The word luxury in the above context has not been used in the sense of something pertaining to the exclusive preserve of the rich It denotes something which is superfluous and not indispensable and to which we take with a view to enjoy amuse or entertain ourselves An expenditure on something which is in excess of what is required for economic and personal well being would be expenditure on Luxury although the expenditure may be of a nature which is incurred by a large number of people including those not economically well off It is no doubt true that for those who have been lured by the charms and blandishments of Lady Nicotine there are few things which are so soothing to the distraught nerves and so entertaining as tobacco and its manifold preparations <NAME> in A Farewell to Tobacco observes For thy sake tobacco I would do anything but die It may be added that there is nothing static about what constitutes an article of luxury A number of factors may have to be taken into account in adjudging a commodity as an article of luxury Any difficulty which may arise in borderline case would not be faced when we are dealing with an article like tobacco which has been recognised to be an article of luxury and is harmful to health The learned Judges in this connection took the view that the levy of tax as a condition preceding to the entry of goods into a place directly impeded the flow of trade to that place We agree with the learned Judges of <ORG> that such levy directly impedes the free flow of trade and as such is violative of article of the Constitution The next question which arises for consideration is whether the levy of tax is protected by article of the Constitution Notwithstanding anything in article or article the Legislature of a State may by law a impose such reasonable restrictions on the freedom of trade Clause of article empowers the <ORG> of a State notwithstanding anything in article or article but subject to the sanction of the President to impose reasonable restrictions on the freedom of trade commerce or intercourse with or within that State as may be required in the public interest Article confers power upon <ORG> to impose by law such restrictions on the freedom of trade commerce or intercourse between one State and another or within any part of the territory of India as may be required in the public interest Perusal of article and article shows that while <ORG> can impose restrictions on the freedom of trade commerce or intercourse between one State and another or within any part of the territory of India as may be required in the public interest so far as the State <ORG>s are concerned restrictions must satisfy two requirements firstly they must be in the public interest and secondly the restrictions should be reasonable The above observations though made in the context of article have equal relevance under article Taxes are levied usually for the obvious purpose of raising revenue To some extent every tax imposes an economic impediment to the activity taxed as compared with others not taxed but that fact by itself would not make it unreasonable It is well settled that when power is conferred upon the legislature to levy tax that power must be widely construed it must include the power to impose a tax and select the articles or commodities for the exercise of such power it must likewise include the power to fix the rate and prescribe the machinery for the recovery of tax This power also gives jurisdiction to the legislature to make such provisions as in its As observed by Chief Justice <NAME> in <NAME> Maryland the power of taxing the people and their property is essential to the very existence of Government and may be legitimately exercised on the objects to which it is applicable to the utmost extent to which the Government may choose to carry it In determining the reasonableness of the restriction we shall have to bear in mind the importance of freedom of trade and the requirement of public interest It is also true that no effort was made in the affidavit filed on behalf of the <ORG> in this case to show as to how the restrictions were reasonable but that fact would not necessarily lead the court to hold that the restrictions are unreasonable If the court on consideration of the totality of facts finds that the restrictions are reasonable the court would uphold the same in spite of lack of details in the affidavit filed on behalf of the <ORG> In judging the question of reasonableness of restriction in the present case we must bear in mind that the levy of luxury tax relates to tobacco the consumption of which involves health hazard The fact that there is no commercial production of tobacco in the area with which we are concerned would show that there is no discrimination between tobacco brought from outside that area and the locally grown tobacco because in fact there is no tobacco of the latter category except that grown on experimental basis Argument has been advanced on behalf of the appellants that the provisions of the Act do not apply to the entire State of Kerala but apply only to those areas which were parts of erstwhile States of Travancore and Cochin In support of the above contentions reference was made to the fact that the Act had been made applicable to the Andhra area and had not been made applicable to the Telengana area This Court upheld the validity of the Act and repelled the contentions No doubt this Court referred to the circumstance that the levy of tax was confined only to the Andhra area and was not operative in the Telengana area in the context of the argument that the Act was violative of article of the Constitution the fact all the same remains that one of the grounds advanced with a view to assail the validity of the Act was that its provisions were not applicable to the Telengana area We are unable to accede to the submission that this Court lost sight of the fact that the Act was not applicable to the Telengana area in holding that its provisions were protected by article of the Constitution It is further pointed out that those provisions of law were found by this Court to be similar to the provisions of the Central Execises and Salt Act and as such those provisions were beyond the competence of <ORG> The above argument has a seeming plausibility but on deeper examination we find it to be not tenable that when an Act passed by <ORG> is invalid on the ground that <ORG> did not have legislative competence to deal with the topics covered by it in that event even <ORG> cannot validate such an Act because the effect of such attempted validation in substance would be to confer legislative competence on <ORG> in regard to a field or topic which by the relevant provisions of the schedules to the Constitution is outside its jurisdiction Where a topic is not included within the relevant List dealing with the legislative competence of <ORG> <ORG> by making a law cannot attempt to confer such legislative competence on <ORG>s The above principle would however have no application where as in the present case what is sought to be done is to validate the recovery of licence fee for stocking and vending of tobacco The impugned provisions under which that levy is sought to be made with a retrospective effect have nothing to do as already pointed out above with production and manufacture of tobacco Where a challenge to the validity of a legal enactment is made on the ground that it is a colourable piece of legislation what has to be proved to the satisfaction of the court is that though the Act ostensibly is within the legislative competence of the legislature in question in substance and reality it covers field which is outside its legislative competence There were similar Acts in several other States which suffered from the same infirmity and to meet that situation <ORG> passed the Sugarcane Cess Validation Act The Act made valid by section all the assessments and collections made before its commencement under the various State Act and laid down that all the provisions of the made under the State Act would be treated as part of section It was further provided that the said section shall be deemed to have existed at all material times when the cess was imposed assessed and collected under the State Act The appellant a sugar factory was asked to pay the cess for the years and The appellant challenged the levy Among the various contentions which were advanced on behalf of the appellant in the case were What the validation of the Act had done was to attempt to cure the legislative incompetence of <ORG>s by validating State Act which were invalid on the ground of absence of legislative competence in the respective State Legislatures <ORG> lrad passed the Act in question not for the purpose of levying a cess of its own but for the purpose of enabling the respective States to retain the amounts which they had illegally collected The Act was therefore a colourable piece of legislation and The Act had not been passed for the purposes of the Union of India and the recoveries of cesses which were retrospectively authorised by it were not likely to go into <ORG> It was held by this Court that if collections are made under statutory provision which are invalid because they deal with a topic outside the legislative competence of <ORG> the <ORG> can in exercise of its undoubted legislative competence pass a law retrospectively validating the said collections by converting their character into collections made under its own statute operating retrospectively The only conditions are that the levy should be of a nature which can answer to the description of luxury tax and that <ORG> should be competent to enact a law for recovery of luxury tax The legislative power was held to include the subsidiary or the auxiliary power to validate law which had been found to be invalid The test of length of time covered by the retrospective operation could nob by itself be treated as decisive As a result of the above we would hold that the impugned provisions are protected by article of the Constitution Lastly it has been argued that section of the impugned Act is invalid because it provides for payment of an amount which had been refunded in pursuance of the order of this Court If a provision regarding the levy of luxury tax is within the competence of <ORG> the said <ORG> would be well within its competence to enact a law for recovery of an amount which though already refunded to a party partakes of the nature of luxury tax in the light of that law As a result of the above we dismiss these appeals but in the circumstances leave the parties to bear their own costs
