The classification made by the Appellate Collector was revised by <ORG> in a proceeding initiated suo motu under Section of the <ORG> Act The controversy between the parties centers round the real meaning of Latex while the appellants submit that Latex is synthetic rubber in the latex form according to the respondents it is not so but on the other hand it is what may be described as resin In order that the <ORG> is able to appreciate the rival contentions both sides addressed us referring to several standard authorities and treatises It is claimed by the appellants that pyratex which is the commercial name for Latex imported by them is exactly similar to the Latex referred to in Mr <NAME> affidavit since it also contains butadiene styrene and vinyl pyridine in the same proportion of with no measurable resin content It is claimed that Latex is an emulsion of synthetic rubber and it is borne out by its chemical composition and by the physical properties It is further said that vinyl pyridine copolymers suffer from the drawback of extremely high rate of cure scorching and incompatibility with other rubbers and hence do not find use in the dry state in spite of their certain superior properties Requirements of actual users for the following items will be met by imports through public sector agency i Synthetic rubber namely Butyl rubber Acrylonitrile Butadiene Copolymer Poly Chloroprene Thikol Polyisoprene Poly butadiene Hypalon Viton Polyarcylic EPDM Chlonobutyl and Bromobutyl Silicone rubber and Silicone rubber master batches and Silicone rubber master batches and Synthetic latex including Vinyl pyridine latex and copolyme of styrene butadiene latex Nitrilre latex and poly chloroprene latex The impugned order itself takes note of all the contentions raised before the <ORG> and also pressed before us This approach is also convenient and unobjectionable since it is urged on behalf of the respondents that we should not entertain fresh materials which were not available before the authority We may therefore briefly note the claim of the appellants to Latex being classified as raw rubber under item I on the grounds advanced before the <ORG> which the authority took note of Latex is a synthetic rubber latex which satisfies wholly each and every test prescribed by the authority in India as well as abroad for classification of rubber It was pointed out before the authority by the appellants that rubber was always obtained first in a latex form and latex was nothing but an aqueous state of rubber that Latex is a liquid rubber designed for use in tyre manufacture as a bonding agent by cross linking with fabrics It was also pointed out with reference to the classification of synthetic rubber latices that <ORG> itself had ruled in several cases that these were to be regarded as coming under I It appears from the order itself that <ORG> was not treating rubber latex as raw rubber assessable under item I till and a decision was taken in that year to accord the same tariff treatment to rubber latex as to rubber raw because it was found that latex had to be imported for various specific uses which required a liquid form It is seldom put to any of the other uses to which rubber natural or synthetic is ordinarily put In fact it does not replace rubber in use though it has similar properties The authority repelled the contention in the following words It appears that there is no accepted definition of the term resin in trade usage or technical literature and resins are identified by their use as resins and in this view Latex may well be considered as a resin latex To revert to the order of the authority it is clear that the authority would be have found no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that Latex in view of chemical composition and physical properties is rubber raw if the same were commercially used as rubber That section reads Except as otherwise provided in this Act or any other law for the time being in force duties of customs shall be levied at such rates as may be specified under the Indian Tariff Act or any other law for the time being in force on goods imported into or exported from India The reason given by the authority that Latex when coagulated as solid rubber cannot be commercially used as an economic proposition as even admitted by the appellants is an extraneous consideration in dealing with the matter We are therefore not required to consider the history and chemistry of synthetic rubber and Latex as a component of SBR with regard to which extensive arguments were addressed by both sides by quoting from different texts and authorities Dealing with the meaning of the term vegetables in the Excise Tax Act in King <ORG> CLR <ORG> observed as follows Now the statute affects nearly everyone the producer or manufacturer the importer wholesaler and retailer and finally the consumer who in the last analysis pays the tax In my view therefore it is not the botanist conception as to what constitutes a fruit or vegetable which must govern the interpretation to be placed on the words but rather what would ordinarily in matters of commerce in Canada be included therein Botanically oranges and lemons are berries but otherwise no one would consider them as such This Court held as follows But this word must be construed not in any technical sense nor from the botanical point of view but as understood in common parlance It has not been defined in the Act and being a word of every day use it must be construed in its popular sense meaning that sense which people conversant with the subject matter with which the statute is dealing would attribute to it It was contended in that case that charcoal would be covered under Entry I of Part III of Schedule II to that Act This <ORG> while holding that charcoal would be included in coal observed as follows Now there can be no dispute that while coal is technically understood as a mineral product charcoal is manufactured by human agency from products like wood and other things But it is now well settled that while interpreting items in statutes like the Sales Tax Act resort should be had not to the scientific or the technical meaning of such terms but to their popular meaning or the meaning attached to them by those dealing in them that is to say to their commercial sense This Court again referred with approval to the decision in <ORG> case supra and followed the principle laid down in <NAME> case supra <ORG> the question that was raised related to item in the Schedule I to the Central Excises and Salt Act which contained compressed liquefied or solidified gases inter alia This Court observed as follows It is also not correct to say that because the sugar manufacturer wants carbon dioxide for carbonation purpose and sets up a kiln for it that he produces carbon dioxide and not kiln gas In fact what he produces is a mixture known both to trade and science as kiln gas one of the constituents of which is no doubt carbon dioxide This Court finally observed The Kiln gas in question therefore is neither carbon dioxide nor compressed carbon dioxide known as such to the commercial community and therefore cannot attract Item in the First Schedule Mr <NAME> draws our attention to several authorities to impress upon us that butadiene styrene latices are compatible with many resins and modifiers We find the same description reiterate in a book Latex Natural and Synthetic by <NAME> a Reinhold Pilot Book where at page it is stated that there is one type of speciality rubber latex that deserves special notice It is clear that meanings given to articles in a fiscal statute must be as people in trade and commerce conversant with the subject generally treat and understand them in the usual course Technical and scientific tests offer guidance only within limits Once the articles are in circulation and come to be described and known in common parlance we then see no difficulty for statutory classification under a particular entry It is good fiscal policy not to put people in doubt and quandary about their liability to duty when a particular product like Latex known to trade and commerce in this country and abroad is imported it would have been better if the article is eonomine put under a proper classification to avoid controversy over the residuary clause We do not see any reason why the same policy could not have been followed in the <ORG> book being complementary to each other It is best left to the authorities entrusted with the subject But where the very basis of the reason for including the article under a residuary head in order to charge higher duty is foreign to a proper determination of this kind this <ORG> will be loath to say that it will not interefere In this case there is rather voluminous evidence from the standard authorities in favour of Latex being a component of SBR which is admittedly classified under rubber raw But assuming and only assuming that evidence is balanced the best course in a fiscal measure is to decide and fix the entry under which the article comes otherwise it will give rise to adoption of varying standards where uniformity should be the rule There is however no estoppel in law against a party in a taxation matter In order to clear the goods for the customs the appellants Agents may have given the classification in accordance with the wishes of the authorities or they may even be under some misapprehension But when law allows them the right to ask for refund on a proper appraisement and which they actually applied for we do not attach any significance to this aspect of the matter pointed out by counsel We are clearly of opinion that in the state of the evidence before the revisional authority no reasonable person could come to the conclusion that Latex would not come under rubber raw The basis of the reason with regard to the end use of the article is absolutely irrelevant in the context of the entry where there is no reference to the use or adaptation of the article In the result the appeals are allowed with costs We should observe that we express no opinion with regard to the question relating to countervailing duty under Section AA of the First Schedule to the Central Excises and Salt Act in these appeals
