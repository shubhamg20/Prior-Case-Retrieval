HEADNOTE The proviso to i of the Sales Tax Act excludes from the term turnover proceeds of sale of agricultural or horticultural produce grown by a person on any land in which he has interest The assessee who was an agriculturist owned tea gardens in the State The final product is sold in the market Before <ORG> the assessee contended that tea leaves sold by him were agricultural produce grown by him on his own land and that therefore the sale of tea effected by him was exempt from sales tax under the proviso to i of the Act Almost every kind of agricultural produce has to undergo some kind of processing or treatment by the agriculturist himself either on the farm or elsewhere in order to make it non perishable transportable and marketable The processes applied were all within the region of minimal processes and at no point of time they crossed that limit and robbed the leaves of their character of being and continuing to be agricultural produce It was tea leaf when selected and plucked and it continued to be tea leaf when after the process of withering crushing and roasting it was sold in the market The following Judgments were delivered UNTWALIA The Commissioner of Sales Tax Lucknow has filed these four appeals by special leave against the judgment of <ORG> given in four sales tax references under the Sales Tax Act hereinafter referred to as the Act The assessee respondent owns some tea gardens in the State of The tea leaves grown by the respondent in his gardens are sold in the market after being processed and packed The stand taken on his behalf before the taxing authorities was that the tea leaves sold by the respondent are agricultural produce grown by himself and therefore the sales were not exigible to sales tax The contention of the assessee was not accepted and <ORG> made four references in respect of the four periods to <ORG> on the following question of law Whether on the facts and circumstances of this case the article ceased to be an agricultural produce and whether the tea produced by the assessee would be exigible to sales tax <ORG> has answered the reference in favour of the assessee and against the revenue The definition of turnover given in section i of the Act at the relevant time stood as follows Turnover means the aggregate amount for which goods are supplied or distributed by way of sale or are sold or the aggregate amount for which goods are bought whichever is greater by a dealer either directly or through another on his account or on account of others whether for cash or deferred payment or other valuable consideration Provided that the proceeds of the sale by a person of agricultural or horticultural produce grown by himself or grown on any land in which he has an interest whether as owner usufructuary mortgagee tenant or otherwise or poultry or dairy products from fowls or animals kept by him shall be excluded from his turnover The above proviso was meant to exempt an agriculturist or a horticulturist from the charge of sales tax in respect of his agricultural or horticultural produce grown by himself in his land in which he has an interest of the kind mentioned in the proviso The short question which falls for our determination therefore is whether the assessee transactions of sale came within the ambit of the proviso Indisputably and undoubtedly the assessee was an agriculturist the tea leaves grown by him in his land were agricultural produce and he had sold them after processing and packing <ORG> has extracted the primary findings of fact recorded by <ORG> in its revisional order They are often purchased by big tea concerns from the owners of the gardens and after processing and packing them they the concerns sell them in the market But when the producer himself does the same or similar kind of job then the question arises whether it can be justifiably said that he also cannot take advantage of the proviso The primary facts as extracted by <ORG> from the order of <ORG> are the following The tea leaves were first of all subjected to withering in shadow in rooms on a wooden floor for about hours then they were crushed by hand or foot and were then roasted for about minutes Later they were roasted on mats for about minutes the leaves were then subjected to grading with sieves of various sizes Fanning machines are also used in completing the grading process The produce was then finally roasted with charcoal for obtaining suitable flavour and colour It is this final product which was eventually sold by the assessees The question for consideration is whether on the findings aforesaid it can be justifiably held in law that the leaves lost their character of being an agricultural produce and became something different It should be remembered that almost every kind of agricultural produce has to undergo some kind of processing or treatment by the agriculturist himself in his farm or elsewhere in order to bring them to a condition of non perishability and to make them transportable and marketable Thereafter packing the wheat in bags or other containers it is taken to the markets for sale One can never suggest that such a wheat product becomes a commodity different from the one which was produced in the process of agriculture Largely the inference to be drawn from the primary facts of processing one may say will be an inference of fact If wrong tests are applied in drawing the inference that the agricultural produce has lost its character of being so then it will be a question of law and <ORG> will have jurisdiction in an appropriate reference as in the present case it had to decide whether the case came under the proviso to section i of the Act But that by itself will not substantially change the character of the tea leaves still they will be known as tea leaves and sold as such in the market In my opinion all the six processes enumerated above from the primary findings of fact recorded in the order of <ORG> were necessary for the purpose of saving the tea leaves from perishing making them fit for transporting and marketing them It would thus be seen that the tea leaves as plucked have got to pass through stages of processing of one kind or the other in order to make them fit for human consumption as in the case of paddy and many other commodities dehusking in the case of former and some other kind of process in regard to the latter has got to be done in order to make them marketable and fit for consumption At page of the first case which was followed in the second occurs a passage which may be usefully quoted here As we have pointed out it was common ground that there is no market in Coimbatore or elsewhere for arecanuts as they are when plucked from the trees and it should be remembered they are gathered when they are still unripe The proviso to section i of the Act is obviously conceived in the interests of agriculturists It excludes from any tax liability under the Act sale of agricultural and horticultural produce the primary condition to be satisfied being that it must be produce of the land which either belongs to the seller or of the land in which he has an interest as specified by section i To restrict that concession to sale of arecanuts for instance only if those arecanuts are sold in the state in which they are immediately on being gathered from the trees would render the statutory exclusion meaningless I approve of this decision There are two decisions of <ORG> given in relation to the question of sugarcane being converted into jaggery In the former case it was observed at page It is true that gur cannot be regarded as an agricultural produce grown on land But if gur is prepared out of the agricultural produce which is grown on land in the absence of any indication to the contrary suggesting that the agricultural produce must be sold in the form in which it is grown we will be justified in holding that an agriculturist who is exclusively selling agricultural produce grown on the land either in the form in which it is grown or in the form in which it is converted for the purpose of transportation or preventing deterioration is within the exception provided by section In the present case with a view to prevent deterioration and for the purpose of facilitating transportation the assessee converted the sugar cane grown by him into gur and sold it It appears to me that this case has gone a bit too far and on an appropriate occasion it may require further consideration Nonetheless in the instant case one can safely conclude as I have done that with a view to prevent deterioration and for the purpose of facilitating transport and making it marketable the assessee himself did some processing to the plucked tea leaves and hence <ORG> was right in holding that such sales were not exigible to sales tax Broadly speaking these cases have been decided on application of the correct principles of law If however the activities of the <ORG> which produced income were attributable partly to agriculture and partly to its manufacturing activities then the whole of the amount could not have been taxed under the Income Tax Act On behalf of the <ORG> it was contended that the manufacturing processes carried out in a modern tea factory with scientific appliances and up to date machinery are different from those ordinarily employed by a cultivator to render the produce raised by him fit to be taken to market <ORG> held that the process in its entirety cannot be appropriately described as agriculture The earlier part of the operation when the tea bush is planted and the young green leaf is selected and plucked may well be deemed to be agriculture The green leaf is not marketable commodity for immediate use as an article of food but it is a marketable commodity to be manufactured by people who possess the requisite machinery into tea fit for human consumption He had himself applied some indigenous and crude manufacturing process in order to enable him to sell his tea in the market In such a situation I have no difficulty in holding that the sale was of his agricultural produce It would be found mentioned at page Both the advocates argued on the basis of the factual position that the packets of chewing tobacco were goods different from tobacco from which the said goods were manufactured On that footing by interpretation of the rule it was held that only excise duty paid on the goods sold by the assessee is deductible from the gross turnover and not the excise duty paid on raw tobacco <ORG> alleged that the process actually applied to the dry leaf was a manufacturing process carried out in a modern tea factory with scientific appliances and the latest machinery <ORG> on a consideration of the respective cases of the parties observed that the entire process could not be described as agriculture and that the process applied to the tea leaf after it had been plucked was a manufacturing process It observed that the green tea leaf was a marketable commodity to be manufactured by people who possessed the requisite machinery into tea fit for human consumption and it continued to be tea leaf when after the process of withering crushing and roasting it was sold in the market
