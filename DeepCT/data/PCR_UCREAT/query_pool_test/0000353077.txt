The preliminary decree for sale was passed by the <ORG> of first instance on the th of May The mortgagors were allowed six months from that date to pay the mortgage amount so that the date fixed for payment was the th of November The plaintiff whose claim had only been partially decreed by the <ORG> of first instance preferred an appeal to the lower <ORG> but that appeal was dismissed on the rd of November Among the pleas raised on behalf of the defendants was the plea of limitation and it was contended that the application had been filed beyond time If however limitation is to be reckoned from the th of November when the date fixed for payment by the <ORG> of first instance expired the application would be beyond time We have therefore to consider whether the right of the plaintiff to apply for a final decree accrued when the decree of <ORG> was passed or on the expiry of the six months allowed for payment by the <ORG> of first instance Order XXXIV Rule provides that where payment is not made as directed by the preliminary decree for sale the <ORG> shall on application made in that behalf by the plaintiff pass a decree that the mortgaged property or a sufficient part thereof be sold and that the proceeds of the sale be dealt with as is mentioned in Rule It seems to me that this rule contemplates the passing of only one final decree in a suit for sale upon a mortgage The essential condition to the making of a final decree is the existence of a preliminary decree which has become conclusive between the parties As has been already stated if an appeal is preferred and the case is decided by the <ORG> the decree of the <ORG> takes the place of the decrees of the Subordinate <ORG>s where it affirms the decrees of those <ORG>s and the decrees of the Subordinate <ORG>s are merged in the decree of the final <ORG> of Appeal In the present case the decree of <ORG> no doubt affirmed the decree of the lower <ORG>s but whether the decree of tin <ORG> is a decree of affirmance or modification of the decrees of the <ORG>s below it is the final decree in the cause In the present case the plaintiff application was to the effect that the decree of this <ORG> should be made final He applied for interest for the period subsequent to the decree of the first <ORG> and subsequent costs which could be added to the amount of the mortgage under Rule to which I was a party it was no doubt held that the right of the decree holder to apply for a final decree accrued upon the expiry of the term fixed for payment Upon further consideration I think the view taken in that case was not correct It is impossible to hold that there can be more final decrees than one in a suit for sale upon a mortgage Unless it be held that the right to apply for a final decree accrues when the decree of the <ORG> is passed in a case in which an appeal has been preferred to the final <ORG> of Appeal it may be open to a party to apply for several final decrees in the same cause I would allow it set aside the orders of the <ORG>s below and remand the case to the <ORG> of first instance for disposal of the application of the plaintiff according to law I fully agree and there is very little that I can with advantage add to the judgment which has just been delivered When that decree is passed it is that decree and only that which can be made final in the cause between the parties The order of the <ORG> is that the appeal is allowed the orders and decrees of the <ORG>s below are set aside and the case is remanded to the <ORG> of first instance with directions to readmit it under its original number in the register and to dispose of it according to law
