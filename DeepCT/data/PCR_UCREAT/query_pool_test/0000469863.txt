<NAME> died leaving some grove and agricultural plots which she had inherited from her husband The original petitioners <NAME> and <NAME> filed objection laying claim to the estate of the deceased widow on the basis of i inheritance being her husband brother son sons ii Will executed by Smt The appeal filed by the petitioners was dismissed by the Settlement Officer Consolidation and their revision under Section of the Act was also dismissed by the Deputy Director of Consolidation by his order dated When the Writ Petition came up for hearing before <NAME> he noticed that one of the questions that arose in the case was as to whether the widow was competent to transfer the whole of her agricultural holding without the prior permission of the Settlement Officer Consolidation as required by Section ii of the Act Section ii of the Act enacts that no tenure holder except with the permission in writing of the Settlement Officer Consolidation previously obtained shall transfer by way of sale gift or exchange any part of his holding in the consolidation area He accordingly referred the matter to <ORG> and that is how this petition has come up before us To begin with we might state that although the learned Judge has not indicated as to whether the entire case has to be decided by <ORG> or only the question relating to the interpretation of Section ii of the Act yet having regard to the fact and the circumstances of the case the intention of the learned Judge was to refer only the limited question relating to the interpretation of Section ii and not the whole case because even if the petitioners fail on this ground their alternative pleas will have to be examined Clause of Section was added in the Act by Section of the Consolidation of Holdings Amendment Act Act XXXVIII of and reads as under Notwithstanding anything contained in the Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act no tenure holder except with the permission in writing of the Settlement Officer Consolidation previously obtained shall i Use his holdings or any part thereof for purpose not connected with agriculture horticulture or animal husbandry including pisciculture and poultry farming or ii transfer by way of sale gift or exchange any part of his holding in the consolidation area Provided that a tenure holder may continue to use his holding or any part thereof for any purpose for which it was in use prior to the date specified in the notification issued under Sub section of Section It may at once be noticed that Clause ii is flanked by Clause i and the proviso at the end of Clause ii The same expression is used in the proviso which in fact is a proviso to Clause i so that ban on the user of agricultural holding for non agricultural purpose extends to the holding as a whole as also to a part thereof Obviously the ban contemplated under Clause i is not co extensive with the ban contained in Clause ii otherwise there is no reason why the expression holding or any part thereof should not have been used in Clause ii also But having regard to the terminology employed in the preceding clause and the succeeding proviso no other meaning can be assigned to it except that it means a part as distinguished from the whole It is true that grammatically the expression a part would have been more apt than the expression any part It is not necessary however to dwell upon this point any further because the question has been the subject matter of previous decisions of this court which have unanimously interpreted the expression any part to mean a part This decision has been affirmed on special appeal by <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> in <NAME> <NAME> All LJ <NAME> AIR All <NAME> when the view taken in the earlier cases was affirmed There is yet another decision of a <ORG> of this court consisting of <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> JJ <ORG> agreed with the view taken by the earlier <ORG> in the case of Smt If one has regard to the object underlying the provisions in question it becomes quite clear as to why the ban in Clauses i and ii is not co extensive The scheme underlying the Act was to consolidate agricultural holdings and to prevent their further fragmentation and also to preserve the land for agricultural purpose It was not the intention to restrict the right of an owner to deal with his property by way of sale exchange or transfer except to the extent that was necessary to carry out the objects of the Act In the matter of interpretation of a local statute the view taken by <ORG> over a number of years should normally be adhered to and not disturbed A different view would not only introduce an element of an uncertainty and confusion it would also have the effect of unsettling transactions which might have been entered on the faith of those decisions The doctrine of stare decisis can be invoked in such a situation There is a lot of force in this contention also but it is not necessary to invoke the doctrine of stare decisis because we are of the firm view that there is no ambiguity whatsoever in the language in which this provision is couched and having regard to all the facts and the circumstances of the case it is not possible to interpret it differently The question arises as to whether in such a situation we should give preference to the English version or to the Hindi version For this purpose we have to turn to Article of the Constitution It enacts Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing provisions of this Part until <ORG> by law otherwise provides a all proceedings in <ORG> and <ORG> the authoritative texts i of all Bills to be introduced or amendments thereto to be moved in either <ORG> or in the <ORG> or either <ORG> of the Legislature of a State ii of all Acts passed by <ORG> or the <ORG> of a State and of all ordinances promulgated by the President or the Governor of a State and iii of all orders rules regulations and bye laws issued under this Constitution or under any law made by <ORG> or the <ORG> of a State shall be in the English language Notwithstanding anything in Sub clause a of Clause the Governor of a State may with the previous consent of the President authorise the use of the Hindi language or any other language used for any official purpose of the State in proceedings in the <ORG> having its principal seat in that State Provided that nothing in this Clause shall apply to any judgment decree or order passed or made by such <ORG> Notwithstanding anything in Sub clause of Clause where the <ORG> of a state has prescribed any language other than the English language for use in Bills introduced in or Acts passed by the <ORG> of the State or in Ordinances promulgated of the Governor of the state or in any order rule regulation or bye law referred to in paragraph iii of that sub clause a translation of the same in the English language published under the authority of the Governor of the State in the official Gazette of that State shall be deemed to be the authoritative text thereof in the English language under this Article Firstly all proceedings in <ORG> and in <ORG> have to be in the English language except when under Clause the Governor of a State with the previous consent of the President authorises the use of the Hindi language or any other local language in proceedings in <ORG> of that State However <ORG>s are authorised to prescribe any language other than the English language for this purpose but in such an event Clause provides that a translation in the English language of any Bill introduced in or Act passed by <ORG> in a language other than the English language has to be published under the authority of the Governor of the State in the Official Gazette of the state and such translation shall be deemed to be the authoritative text of such a Bill and Act Article makes a provision for official language of a <ORG> and provides that <ORG> may by law adopt any one or more of the languages in use in the <ORG> or the Hindi as the language or languages to be used for all or any of the official purposes Article makes a provision about the official language for communication between one <ORG> and another or between a <ORG> and the Union These Articles have no bearing upon the question before us It is thus clear that the provisions contained in Articles and are subject to the provisions contained in Article It only means that <ORG> may prescribe any language other than the English Language for use in Bills introduced in or Acts passed by <ORG> and that Clause shall not create an impediment in its way As we have already indicated above when a Bill is introduced or an Act is passed in a language other than the English language by <ORG> an authoritative translation thereof in the English language has to be provided and that translation shall for the purposes of Clause be deemed to be the authoritative text thereof Thus when there is a conflict between the English version of a Statute of <ORG> and its version in a local language the version in English language will prevail over the version in the local language There is no competition between the two
