Though in its more recent pronouncements this <ORG> laid less emphasis on compelling reasons the principle has remained the same That principle is that in deciding appeals against acquittal the <ORG> of Appeal must examine the evidence with particular care and must also examine the reasons on which the order of acquittal was based and should interfere with the order only when satisfied that the view taken by the acquitting judge was clearly unreasonable Once it was found that the High <ORG> applied the correct principles in setting aside the order of acquittal this <ORG> will not ordinarily interfere with the High <ORG> order of conviction in appeal against acquittal enter into the evidence to ascertain whether the High <ORG> was right in its view of the evidence Only such examination of the evidence would ordinarily be necessary as is needed to see that the High <ORG> approached the question properly and applied the principle correctly If the judgment of the High <ORG> did not disclose a careful examination of the evidence in coming to the conclusion that the view of the acquitting court was unreasonable or if it appeared that the High <ORG> erred on questions of law or misread the evidence or the judgment of the trial court this <ORG> would unless the case was sent back to the High <ORG> for re hearing appraise the evidence for itself to examine the reasons on which the lower court based its order of acquittal and then decide whether the High <ORG>s view that the conditions of the lower court was unreasonable was correct It was neither a rule of law nor of prudence that a dying declaration should be corroborated by other evidence before a conviction could be ba ed thereon The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> Six persons including the present appellants were tried by the Additional Sessions Judge Ferozpur on several charges in connection with the death by homicidal injuries of two brothers <NAME> and <NAME> It is against this order of conviction that <NAME> and Major <NAME> have filed the present appeal after obtaining special leave from this Court <NAME> it is said struck <NAME> on the abdomen with a Sela in his hand <NAME> it is said gave him a Sela thrust in the abdomen <NAME> died on the spot <NAME> was brought to the hospital at Gidderbha the following morning and received some treatment but he also died of his injuries the following day that is the th July To prove its Base the prosecution relied on the evidence of two persons the deceased father <NAME> and their uncle <NAME> and the dying declaration alleged to have been made by <NAME> once in the village before <NAME> the Sub Inspector of Police who had come to the village that night in connection with some other investigation and for the second time at Gidderbha hospital before a Magistrate He was doubtful also about the truth of the Sub Inspector story that he actually reached the village of occurrence on that very night and consequently doubtful about any statement having been made by <NAME> to him on that night In any case he thought <NAME> dying declaration had little probative value because as many as six persons had been named and that it could not be relied upon without corroboration These were the main reasons for which he came to the conclusion that the case had not been proved against any of the accused beyond reasonable doubt and accordingly acquitted the accused <ORG> was of opinion that the learned Judge was wholly wrong in holding that <NAME> was not mentioned in the Inquest Report that he had misread the time of the first Information Report as for A and that he was again in error in concluding that the statement made by <NAME> to the police on their arrival at A was inadmissible After pointing out these errors in the reasoning of the learned Trial Judge <ORG> said We have no hesitation in concluding that for the said reasons the judgment of the learned Additional Sessions Judge is wholly erroneous resulting in complete miscarriage of justice The main contention raised by Mr <NAME> on behalf of the appellants is that <ORG> had no sufficient reasons for interfering with the order of acquittal made by the Additional Sessions Judge and that <ORG> itself had been guilty of errors especially as <ORG> has misread the judgment of the learned Additional Sessions Judge and had attributed to him statements which are not to be found in his judgment The question as regards the correct principles to be applied by a <ORG> hearing an appeal against acquittal of a person has engaged the attention of this <ORG> from the very beginning In many cases especially the earlier ones the <ORG> has in laying down such principles emphasised the necessity of interference with an order of acquittal being based only on compelling and substantial reasons and has expressed the view that unless such reasons are present an Appeal court should not interfere with an order of acquittal In later years the <ORG> has often avoided emphasis on compelling reasons but nonetheless adhered to the view expressed earlier that before interfering in appeal with an order of acquittal a <ORG> must examine not only questions of law and fact in all their aspects but must also closely and carefully examine the reasons which impelled the lower courts to acquit the accused and should interfere only if satisfied after such examination that the conclusion reached by the lower court that the guilt of the person has not been proved is unreasonable <NAME> The State of Madhya Pradesh <NAME> The State of Bombay It is clear that in emphasising in many cases the necessity of compelling reasons to justify an interference with an order of acquittal the <ORG> did not in any way try to curtail the power bestowed on appellate courts under of the Code of Criminal Procedure when hearing appeals against acquittal but conscious of the intense dislike in our jurisprudence of the conviction of innocent persons and of the facts that in many systems of jurisprudence the law does not provide at all for any appeal against an order of acquittal the <ORG> was anxious to impress can the appellate courts the importance of bestowing special care in the sifting of evidence in appeal against acquittals But on close analysis it iq clear that the principles laid down by the court ill this matter have remained the same Once the appellate court comes to the conclusion that the view taken by the lower court is clearly an unreasonable one that itself is a compelling reason for interference For it is a court duty to convict a guilty person when the guilt is established beyond reasonable doubt no less than it is its duty to acquit the accused when such guilt is not so established When <ORG> judgment shows clearly that the matter has been approached in the proper manner and the correct principles have been applied there is very little scope for this <ORG> to interfere with an order made by <ORG> convicting an accused person in an appeal against acquittal The position may however be different if the judgment of <ORG> while indicating its conclusion that in its opinion the view taken by the lower court is unreasonable does not disclose a careful examination of the evidence for coming to such conclusion Or it may appear from <ORG> judgment that <ORG> has erred on questions of law or has obviously misread the evidence on the record or the judgment of <ORG> So unless this <ORG> thinks fit to send the case back to <ORG> for re hearing of the appeal and its disposal in accordance with law it becomes the duty of this <ORG> in cases like these which fortunately are likely to be few in number to appraise the evidence for itself to examine the reasons on which the lower court based the order of acquittal and then decide whether <ORG> conclusion that the view taken by the lower <ORG> on the question of the guilt of the accused is clearly unreasonable is correct If satisfied that the view was clearly unreasonable this <ORG> is bound to dismiss the appeal and to maintain the order of conviction made by <ORG> if on the contrary this <ORG> is not satisfied on such examination that the conclusion reached by the lower court that the guilt of the accused has not been proved was clearly unreasonable the order of acquittal would be restored We also notice that the learned judges of <ORG> were under some misapprehension in thinking that the Additional Sessions Judge had held that <NAME> was not mentioned as a witness in the Inquest Report While it is true that a general statement is made by both the witnesses as regards all the six accused having attacked both Munshi <NAME> and Hazura <NAME> neither of them has spoken of any particular injury having been caused by Major <NAME> Hazura <NAME> himself in his dying declaration did say that Major <NAME> gave him a Sela blow on his left wrist but does not speak of any other injury having been caused by Major <NAME> either to him or to Munshi <NAME> except that he also said generally that all the accused gave blows on the person of Munshi <NAME> In view of all this we consider it necessary to examine the judgment of <ORG> and also the evidence on record ourselves for a proper decision of this appeal From the printed record before us we find that <NAME> Head Constable who actually entered the formal First Information Report stated in his evidence that he made the entry at on the th July It is apparently this fact taken with the fact that the report did not reach the Magistrate <NAME> before on the th July that made the learned Judge think that the First Information was made at the Police Station at He has unfortunately not noticed that the record of the First Information Report Ex PP itself there is no escape from the conclusion that as stated in <NAME> Examination in Chief was a slip of tongue and the correct time of the record was A and that the fact that it reached the Magistrate at that day may well be due to the fact that the Constable was negligent and took his own time about going to the Magistrate or to some other reason not clear from the record The reasoning of the Trial Judge based on his wrong view about the time of recording of the formal First Information Report that the complainant party was not able to say who the assailants were and so delay was made therefore falls to the ground The learned Judge has also misdirected himself in thinking that the dying declaration had very little probative value because as many as six accused persons had been named and that no conviction could in law be based on such dying declaration without corroboration The law does not make any distinction between a dying declaration in which one person is named and a dying declaration in which several persons are named as culprits Just as when a number of persons are mentioned as culprits by a person claiming to be an eye witness in his evidence in court the court has to take care in deciding whether he has lied or made a mistake about any of them so also when a number of persons appear to have been mentioned as culprits in a dying declaration that court has to scrutinise the evidence in respect of each of the accused Speaking for the <ORG> <NAME> as he then was observed in that case It is settled law that it is not safe to convict an accused person merely on the evidence furnished by a dying declaration without further corroboration because such a statement is not made on oath and is not subject to cross examination and because the maker of it might be mentally and physically in a state of confusion and might well be drawing upon his imagination while he was making the declaration After pointing out that in <NAME> Case Supra the <ORG> after a careful examination of the facts of that case distinctly came to the conclusion that the dying declaration was not true and could not be relied upon this <ORG> stated in the later case that the observations of the <ORG> in <NAME> case were in the nature of obiter dicta The <ORG> then proceeded to review the relevant provisions of the Evidence Act and of the decided cases in the different High <ORG>s in India and in this <ORG> and stated the law in these words that it cannot be laid down as an absolute rule of law that a dying declaration cannot form the sole basis of conviction unless it is corroborated that each case must be determined on its own facts keeping in view the circumstances in which the dying declaration was made that it cannot be laid down as a general position that a dying declaration is a weaker kind of evidence than other pieces of evidence that a dying declaration stands on the same footing as anotherpiece of evidence and has to be judged in the light of surrounding circumstances and with reference to the principles governing the weighing of evidence that a dying declaration which has been recorded by a competent magistrate in the proper manner that is to say in the form of questions and answers and as far as practicable in the words of the maker of the declaration stands on a much higher footing than a dying declaration which depends upon oral testimony which may suffer from all the infirmities of human memory and human character and that in order to test the reliability of a dying declaration the <ORG> has to keep in view the circumstances like the opportunity of the dying man for observation for example whether there was sufficient light if the crime was committed at night whether the capacity of the man to remember the facts stated had not been impaired at the time he was making the statement by circumstances beyond his control that the statement has been consistent throughout if he had several opportunities of making a dying declaration apart from the official record of it and that the statement had been made at the earliest opportunity and was not the result of tutoring by interested parties Hence in order to pass the test of reliability a dying declaration has to be subjected to a very close scrutiny keeping in view the fact that the statement has been made in the absence of the accused who had no opportunity of testing the veracity of the statement by cross examination But once the court has come to the conclusion that the dying declaration was the truthful version as to the circumstances of the death and the assailants of the victim there is no question of further corroboration If on the other hand the <ORG> after examining the dying declaration in all its aspects and testing its veracity has come to the conclusion that it is not reliable by itself and that it suffers from an infirmity then without corroboration it cannot form the basis of a conviction Thus the necessity for corroboration arises not from any inherent weakness of a dying declaration as a piece of evidence as held in some of the reported cases but from the fact that the court in a given case has come to the conclusion that that particular dying declaration was not free from the infirmities referred to above or from other infirmities as may be disclosed in evidence in that case In view of this latest pronouncement of this <ORG> which it should be stated in fairness to the Trial Judge was made long after he gave his judgment it must be held that it is neither a rule of law nor of prudence that a dying declaration requires to be corroborated by other evidence before a conviction can be based thereon The evidence furnished by the dying declaration must be considered by the Judge just as the evidence of any witness though undoubtedly some special considerations arise in the assessment of dying declarations which do not arise in the case of assessing the value of a statement made in <ORG> by a person claiming to be witness of the occurrence In view of this latest pronouncement of this <ORG> on the question of need of corroboration of a dying declaration by other evidence it must be held that the Trial Judge was wrong in thinking that he could not act on the dying declaration of <NAME> unless it was corroborated by other evidence In view of the several defects in the reasoning of the Trial Judge it is necessary for us to examine the evidence on the record to see whether <ORG> was right in thinking that the view taken by the learned Judge was clearly unreasonable The most important evidence in the case is furnished by the dying declaration made by <NAME> The Investigating Officer <NAME> has said that on July he had gone to the village Rikala on an excise raid and from there he went to Mallan at about on July to investigate a case under section of the Indian Penal Code We see no reason to doubt the truth of his statement that he did reach Dhurkot shortly after midnight of the rd July and that when on hearing that a murder had taken place near the Dharamshala he came to the Dharamshala <NAME> who was lying injured on a cot there made a statement to him he recorded the statement correctly The substance of this statement is that at about on the night of the occurrence his brother <NAME> came and complained about the conduct of <NAME> <NAME> and other sons of <NAME> and that shortly after this on hearing shouts of <NAME> and others near the Lharamshala <NAME> went towards that place followed by <NAME> and his father <NAME> and that when they reached the place they found <NAME> and the other accused persons all armed with weapons raising uproar and when <NAME> reached the place and returned the abuse <NAME> gave the first blow to <NAME> with a Sela in his hand hitting him on the front of the chest after which others of the party also gave blows and when <NAME> stepped forward to rescue his brother <NAME> gave him a blow with a Sela in his hand which hit him on the abdomen and the other accused also gave him blows It is clear that this statement was made by <NAME> shortly after midnight i within about four hours after the occurrence We are satisfied from the evidence of the witnesses that there was sufficient moonlight that to enable <NAME> to recognize clearly the assailant who struck the blow which caused this injury He could have therefore made no mistake about the indentity of his assailant The several injuries on <NAME> and the numerous injuries on <NAME> justify the conclusion that there was more than one assailant in the attacking party Whether or not <NAME> could have made a mistake about the identity of the other assailants or could have implicated some of them at least falsely it will be unreasonable to think that he would substitute another person for the one assailant who gave him the fatal blow Even if there was no other evidence on the records as regards the part taken by the appellant <NAME> this dying declaration of <NAME> is so clearly true that the only reasonable view for a judge of facts to take is that <NAME> caused the death of <NAME> by striking him with a Sela As has already been noticed <NAME> in this statement mentioned <NAME> as the person who gave the first blow to <NAME> the blow which caused one of the injuries on his chest We can think of no reason why this main part should be ascribed falsely to <NAME> we think considering the circumstances in which the statement was made that this part of <NAME> statement is also clearly the truth and could reasonably be accepted even without any corroboration In this statement also he mentioned <NAME> and the other accused persons as having taken part in the attack Indeed after he had made a part of the statement the Magistrate recorded that he had started giving indifferent answers and asked the Doctor to give him the necessary treatment But it will be noticed that there is nothing in this latter statement which detracts from the truth of the earlier statement made shortly after the occurrence to the police sub Inspector There is apart from this the testimony in Court of <NAME> the father of the two deceased persons and his uncle <NAME> While there is nothing in law which requires the statement of witnesses to be recorded in the Inquest Report it appears to be a common practice in Punjab for police officers to record statements of witnesses in Inquest Reports It is also difficult to understand <NAME> statement that he left the place as soon as some neighbours came up after the occurrence and did not go back to the spot till he was called by the police We are unable however to discover any valid reason for doubting the presence of <NAME> at the place of occurrence It seems to us that the main reason for the Trial Judge to doubt the truth of <NAME> evidence was what he considered the great delay in lodging the formal First Information Report On an examination it seems to us quite likely that <NAME> also accompanied <NAME> when the latter followed <NAME> towards the Dharmashala and it also seems to us improbable that he would give the main part in the assault falsely to <NAME> if somebody else was responsible for the blow which caused <NAME> death Apart from Bhag <NAME> only Hira <NAME> has ascribed any specific part to Major <NAME> in addition to saying generally that he took part in the attack We therefore allow the appeal of Major <NAME> set aside the order of conviction and sentence made against him by <ORG> and restore the order of acquittal made by <ORG>
