Six persons stood their trial before the Sessions Judge Sangli the appellant on the charge of murder of one <NAME>bai and the rest under Section read with Section Penal Code for causing the evidence of the said murder to disappear by burning her dead body in survey No of village arandi Of these persons the appellant hereinafter referred to as accused and accused and are the sons of accused and accused is his wife Thereafter the police investigation commenced during the course of which the police took charge of the charred body of the deceased and sent it for post mortem Dr <NAME> who performed the post mortem found apart from the burn injuries two external injuries on the body a wound upto the vertebral column upon the right of the neck just below the right ear and a wound with the fracture of the vertebral column According to the post mortem notes made by Dr <NAME> death was probably caused by the aforesaid two injuries on the neck resulting in the failure of the heart and respiration There were other witnesses also to prove their having dragged out the dead body of <NAME> from the burning pyre When he came near his house he found several persons there who had already placed her dead body on a pyre and set fire to it The other witnesses also had given false evidence against them owing to similar hostility existing between them for one reason or the other The Trial Judge accepted the fact that <NAME> had given the first information report but refused to rely on it as <NAME> had not specifically stated therein the fact of his having been told by <NAME> that accused I had struck the deceased with an axe He declined to accept the prosecution story of motive on the ground that accused had earlier executed <NAME> which belied the allegation that he had insisted upon <NAME> conveying her land to him or his sons or adopting one of his sons He also found the version of <NAME> unacceptable that <NAME> had come running to him or that she had told him of the assault on <NAME> by accused with an axe or his having then gone to <NAME> and telling him of what he had been told by <NAME> or the two of them having gone to <NAME> and then to the Kotwal and the Police Patil and telling them that accused I had killed <NAME> with an axe and accused and had brought the body to their field for burning it He refused to accept <NAME> evidence on the ground that being the village Ramoshi and bound as such to help the police whenever a crime took place in the village he was likely to be under the police influence and that it was result of such influence and at the instance of the police that he and <NAME> gave their evidence The Trial Judge ended his judgment in the following words To summarise therefore that is a case where there does not seem to be any plausible motive for criminal behavior on the part of any of the accused and if the evidence of phuba is excluded as I have done there is no direct evidence But then in view of the medical opinion and the opinion of <ORG> and the absence of motive all that could be said is that these circumstances would create a suspicion but suspicion is no evidence In doing so <ORG> accepted <NAME> as the eye witness and found her evidence corroborated by the evidence of <NAME> the wife of accused of her having drawn <NAME> attention by her screams to the place where <NAME> was attacked and was lying and <NAME> thereupon having gone to that place and found <NAME> having been already dead with axe injuries <ORG> next accepted <NAME> version of having been informed of the assault by <NAME> and <NAME> his having then gone near the accused house his having seen all the accused near the burning pyre and accused having threatened him with the axe which he still had in his hand if he proceeded any further to the place where the body was being burnt <ORG> reached these conclusions after elaborately reappraising the entire evidence on record which on an appeal against acquittal it is well settled it could and recording correctly the principles laid down in the decisions of this Court guiding its approach in appeals against acquittal and also examined the reasons given by the Trial Judge for non acceptance of the prosecution evidence These principles are that under the CrPC <ORG> has full power to review at large the evidence upon which an order of acquittal has been passed by <ORG> and to reach the conclusion that upon that evidence the order of acquittal should be reversed However in exercising that power and before reaching its conclusion upon facts <ORG> should give proper weight and consideration to such matters as the views of the trial judge as to the credibility of the witnesses the presumption of innocence in favour of the accused a presumption certainly not weakened by the fact that he has been acquitted at his trial the right of the accused to the benefit of any doubt and the slowness of the appellate court in disturbing a finding of fact arrived at by the judge who had the advantage of seeing the witnesses There is no indication in the evidence of any previous hostility between <NAME> and the accused which could impel <NAME> either to invest such evidence himself or to permit himself to be manoeuvered by any other person into investing such a story for a motive The document did not acknowledge her absolute title and her right to alienate the land during her life time or to make a bequest of it by a testamentary instrument in favour of any one Evidence as to motive would no doubt go a long way in cases wholly dependent on circumstantial evidence But that would not be so in cases where there are eye witnesses of credibility though even in such case if a motive is properly proved such proof would strengthen the prosecution case and fortify the court in its ultimate conclusion It is true that there was only a solitary eye witness in the present case and that too a girl of twelve years of age to whom the Trial Judge did not consider it expedient to give the oath since according to him she was not mature enough to understand the significance of the oath At the same time there was in the circumstances of the case scarcely any possibility of there only because she had gone to the field with the deceased at the latter request to her father <NAME> for assistance But there was nothing improbable in <NAME> having done so for that was expected of her by the deceased was to pluck out from the ground groundnut creepers and collect them into heaps The Trial Judge however thought this to be unlikely for he said that she had gone with her father to his field precisely for this kind of work and therefore was not likely to leave him alone to do the entire work There was therefore nothing improbable in <NAME> being in the deceased field when the incident in question occurred But the absence of any such infirmity according to him was not enough and brought in the omission of <NAME> to specifically mention the fact of accused having struck the deceased with an axe in the first information report as a reason for discarding <NAME> evidence Before it can be held as an omission it has to be borne in mind that according to the FIR <NAME> had been informed by <NAME> and <NAME> that his sister <NAME> was killed by her cousin father in law and husband brother and that they were about to set fire to her dead body near their residence in their field That could hardly be a justifiable ground for discarding his testimony Counsel took us through the medical evidence including the post mortem notes by Dr <NAME> to show that his opinion on the two external injuries was not indefinite but was on the contrary equivocal and shaky on the question whether the injuries were ante mortem or post mortem There would therefore be no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that the deceased had died as a result of her having been struck with a weapon such as an axe The defence story that she died as a result of a snake bite and that her body had to be immediately burnt because of a belief or practice to that effect in the village has only to be stated for its rejection The principle upon which this <ORG> in appeals of this type would act is that once it is found that the High <ORG> has applied the correct principles in setting aside an order of acquittal this <ORG> would not ordinarily interfere with the High <ORG> order of conviction in an appeal against acquittal or enter into the evidence to ascertain for itself whether the High <ORG> was right in its view of the evidence Only such examination of the evidence would ordinarily be necessary as needed to see that the High <ORG> approached the question properly and applied the principles correctly After having gone through that evidence we find no reason to come to the conclusion that the High <ORG> made any error in applying the principles which should guide it in an appeal against acquittal nor has any reason been established which would make us disagree with its findings on the appreciation of evidence
