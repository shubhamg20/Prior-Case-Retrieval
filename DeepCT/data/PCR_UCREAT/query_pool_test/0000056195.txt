At that time there was a full moon and the light of a gas lamp and several lanterns The informers had placed their guns on a cot close to the platform and one <NAME> was sitting on that cot Did you state to the Investigating Officer that the gang rolled the dead bodies of <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> and scrutinised them and did you tell him that the face of <NAME> resembled with that of the deceased <NAME> The <NAME> judge convicted the appellants under Indian Penal Code and sentenced them to death Though <ORG> held that the omissions amounted to contradictions and that the <NAME> judge had wrongly dis allowed cross examination with respect thereto it found that even after ignoring these two circumstances there were other facts which showed that the culprits had come close to the eye witnesses and that they had unmistaken opportunity of identifying the appellants in the light of the full moon and the lanterns <ORG> accordingly dismissed the application for summoning the eye witnesses holding that no prejudice had been caused to the appellants by the disallowance of the cross examination in respect of omissions and also dismissed the appeals and confirmed the convictions and sentences of the appellants that the omissions did not amount to contradictions and that the <NAME> judge was right in disallowing cross examination in respect thereof A statement to the police could be used under of the Code only for the purpose of contradicting a statement in the witness box under the second part of Evidence Act but it could not be used for the purpose of cross examining the witness under the first part of A statement made to the police but not reduced to writing could not be used for any purpose not even for contradiction It was incorrect to say that all omissions in regard to important features of the incident which were expected to be included in the statement made before the police should be treated as contradictions It was for the the trial judge to decide in each case after comparing the part or parts of the statement recorded by the police with that made in the witness box whether the recital intended to be used for contradiction was one of the nature indicated above Relevant and material omissions amount to vital contradictions which can be established by crossexamination and confronting the witness with his previous statement to the police In the circumstances of the present case even if the defence had been allowed to put questions concerning the omissions it would not have affected the credibility of the witnesses and no prejudice was caused to appellants by the disallowance of the questions Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated September of <ORG> in Criminal Appeal No of and Referred Trial No of arising out of the judgment and order dated September of <ORG> at Etawah in Sessions Trial Nos and of was delivered by <NAME> SUBBA RAO This appeal by special leave raises the question of construction of Code of Criminal Procedure The prosecution case is that a large number of persons armed with fire arms suddenly appeared near a well situated on the southern side of the house of <NAME> and opened fire which resulted in the death of <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> and injuries to six persons namely <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> The topography of the locality where the incident took place is given in the two site plans Ex The prosecution version of the sequence of events that took place on that fatal night is as follows After the dinner there was a music performance in front of the platform of <NAME> house and a number of persons assembled there to hear the music it was a full moon night and there were also a gas lamp and several lanterns While <NAME> was among the audience <NAME> was still taking his dinner inside the house <NAME> who was also shot at and injured took up <NAME> gun and went up to the roof of <NAME> house wherefrom he fired shots at the dacoits who were retreating The other accused <NAME> though made a statement before the Sub Divisional Magistrate admitting some facts which were only exculpatory in nature denied the commission of the offence before the committing Magistrate and before the learned Sessions Judge Did you state to the investigating officer that the gang rolled the dead bodies of <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> and scrutinized them and did you tell him that the face of <NAME> resembled that of the deceased <NAME> Did you state to the investigating officer about the presence of the gas lantern In regard to the first question the learned Sessions Judge made the following note The cross examining Counsel was asked to show the law which entitles him to put this question In respect of the second question the following note is made He is also unable to show any law entitling him to put this question After his evidence was closed the learned Judge delivered a considered order giving his reasons for disallowing the said two questions The relevant part of the order reads Therefore if there is no contradiction between his evidence in <ORG> and his recorded statement in the diary the latter cannot be used at all either that that fact had not existed or that the reverse and irreconcilable fact had existed it is a case of conflict between the deposition in the <ORG> and the statement under section Cr and the latter can be used to contradict the former But if he had not stated under section anything about the fact there is no conflict and the statement cannot be used to contradict him In some cases an omission in the statement under section may amount to contradiction of the deposition in <ORG> they are the cases where what is actually stated is irreconcilable with what is omitted and impliedly negatives its existence The two appeals were heard along with the reference made by the learned Sessions Judge under of the Code of Criminal Procedure for the confirmation of the sentence of death awarded to the appellants The learned Judges of <ORG> after reviewing the entire evidence over again accepted the findings of the learned Sessions Judge and con firmed the convictions and sentences passed on the appellants Before <ORG> a petition was filed by the appellants alleging that the learned Sessions Judge did not allow the Counsel for defence to put omissions amounting to material contradictions to the eye witnesses and therefore the said eye witnesses should be summoned so that the said questions might be put to them That petition was filed on May and on July after the argument in the appeals was closed the petition was dismissed Presumably no attempt was made to press this application either before the appeals were taken up for argument or during the course of the argument but the question raised in the petition was considered by the earned Judges of <ORG> in their judgment The judgment discloses that the learned Counsel appearing for the appellants argued before <ORG> that the learned Sessions Judge wrongly disallowed the aforesaid two questions and the learned Judges conceding that those two questions should have been allowed held that the accused were not prejudiced by the said fact They justified their conclusion by the following reasons We did so because among other reasons we decided to ignore these two circumstances and to base our findings on matters of greater certainty namely the fact of the miscreants firing while advancing passing in front of <NAME> platform and taking away <NAME> gun from the cot movements which brought them close to the eye witnesses and thereby gave the witnesses an unmistakable opportunity of seeing their faces in the light of the lanterns and the full moon In the result they dismissed the appeals The present appeal is by special leave filed against the judgment of <ORG> Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure by its own operation attracts the provisions of of the Evidence Act and under the latter section the whole vista of cross examination on the basis of the previous statement in writing made by the witnesses before the police is open to the accused to illustrate the contention a witness can be asked whether he made a particular statement before the police officers if he says yes the said assertion can be contradicted by putting to him an earlier statement which does not contain such a statement The word contradiction is of such wide connotation that it takes in all material omissions and a Court can decide whether there is one such omission as to amount to contradiction only after the question is put answered and the relevant statement or part of it is marked and therefore no attempt should be made to evolve a workable principle but the question must be left at large to be decided by the Judge concerned on the facts of each case tended to put to the witnesses many other omissions to establish that there was development in the prosecution case from time to time but refrained from doing so in obedience to the considered order made by the learned Sessions Judge Even if only two questions were illegally disallowed as it was not possible to predicate the possible effect of the cross examination of the witnesses on the basis of their answers to the said questions on their reliability it should be held that the accused had no opportunity to have an effective cross examination of the witnesses and there fore they had no fair trial We shall proceed to consider the contentions of the learned Counsel for the appellants in the order in which they were addressed Re The latest amendments were made by Act of which received the assent of the President on August and by notification issued by <ORG> its provisions came into force on and from January We are not concerned in this case with the Amending Act of but only with the Act as it stood before the amendment of In Act of the section corresponding to the present was which read An officer in charge of a <ORG> station or other <ORG> officer making an investigation may examine orally any person supposed to be acquainted with the facts and circumstances of the case and may reduce into writing any statement made by the person so examined Such person shall be bound to answer all questions relating to such case put him by such officer other than questions criminating himself No statement so reduced into writing shall be signed by the person making it nor shall it be This section enables a police officer to elicit information from persons supposed to be acquainted with facts and permits him to reduce into writing the answers given by such persons but excludes the said statement from being treated as part of the record or used as evidence Act of divided the aforesaid into two sections and numbered them as ss and which read Any Police officer making an investigation under this chapter may examine orally any person supposed to be acquainted with the facts and circumstances of the case and may reduce into writing any statement made by the person so examined Such person shall be bound to answer truly all questions relating to such case put to him by such officer other than questions the answers to which would have a tendency to expose him to a criminal charge or to a penalty or forfeiture No statement other than a dying declaration made by any person to a Police officer in the course of an investigation under this chapter shall if reduced to writing be signed by the person making it or be used as evidence against the accused Nothing in this section shall be deemed to affect the provisions of section of the Indian Evidence Act There was not much difference between the third paragraph of of the Act of and of the Act of except that in the latter Act it was made clear that the prohibition did not apply to a dying declaration or affect the provisions of of the Indian Evidence Act The Code of did not make any change in nor did it introduce any substantial change in the body of except taking away the exception in regard to the dying declaration from it and putting it in the second clause of that section But was amended by Act of and the amended section read No statement made by any person to a police officer in the course of an investigation under this Chapter shall if taken down in writing be signed by the person making it nor shall such writing be used as evidence Provided that when any witness is called for the prosecution whose statement has been taken down in writing as aforesaid the <ORG> shall on the request of the accused refer to such writing and may then if the <ORG> thinks it expedient in the interests of justice direct that the accused be furnished with a copy thereof and such statement may be used to impeach the credit of such witness in manner provided by the Indian Evidence Act For the first time the proviso to introduced new elements namely i The right of the accused to request the <ORG> to refer to the statement of a witness reduced to writing ii a duty cast on the <ORG> to refer to such writing iii discretion conferred on the <ORG> in the interests of justice to direct that the accused be furnished with a copy of the statement and iv demarcating the field within which such statements can be used namely to impeach the credit of the witness in the manner provided by the Indian Evidence Act It was argued for the prosecution that on the strength of of the Evidence Act the right of the prosecution to prove any oral statement to contradict the testimony of any witness under that section was not taken away by of the Code of Criminal Procedure which only provided that the writing shall not be used as evidence On the other hand it was contended on behalf of the accused that when the statement of a witness was admittedly reduced into writing it would be unreasonable to allow any oral evidence of the statement to be given when the writing containing the statement could not be proved The point is not free from difficulty which is sufficiently reflected in the diversity of judicial opinions bearing on the question Section as amended by the aforesaid Act reads No statement made by any person to a police officer in the course of an investigation under this Chapter shall if reduced into writing be signed by the person making it nor shall any such statement or any record thereof whether in a police diary or otherwise or any part of such statement or record be used for any purpose save as hereinafter provided at any inquiry or trial in respect of any offence under investigation at the time when such statement was made Provided that when any witness is called for the prosecution in such inquiry or trial whose statement has been reduced into writing as aforesaid the Court shall on the request of the accused refer to such writing and direct that the accused be furnished with a copy thereof in order that any part of such statement if duly proved may be used to contradict such witness in the manner provided by section of the Indian Evidence Act When any part of such statement is so used any part thereof may also be used in the reexamination of such witness but for the purpose only of explaining any matter referred to in his cross examination Provided further that if the <ORG> is of opinion that any part of any such statement is not relevant to the subject matter of the inquiry or trial or that its disclosure to the accused is not essential in the interests of justice and is inexpedient in the public interests it shall record such opinion but not the reasons therefore and shall exclude such part from the copy of the statement furnished to the accused Sub section of the substituted section attempted to steer clear of the aforesaid conflicts and avoid other difficulties by the following ways a Prohibited the use of the statement both oral and that reduced into writing from being used for any purpose at any inquiry or trial in respect of any offence under investigation while the earlier section enabled the accused to make use of it to impeach the credit of a witness in the manner provided by the Indian Evidence Act the new section enabled him only to use it to contradict the witness in the manner provided by of the said Act the said statement could also be used for the purpose of only explaining any matter referred to in his cross examination and while under the old section a discretion was vested in the <ORG> in the matter of furnishing the accused with a copy of an earlier statement of a prosecution witness under the amended section subject to the second proviso a duty was cast upon the <ORG> if a request was made to it by the accused to direct that the accused be furnished with a copy thereof The effect of the amendment was that the loopholes which enabled the use of the statement made before the police in a trial were plugged and the only exception made was to enable the accused to use the statement of a witness reduced into writing for a limited purpose namely in the manner provided by of the Indian Evidence Act and the prosecution only for explaining the matter referred to in his cross examination While the former section enables a witness to be cross examined as to a previous statement made by him in writing without such writing being shown to him the latter section permits the discrediting of the witness by proof of his previous statement by independent evidence If a statement in writing could be used to discredit a witness in the manner provided by those two sections the purpose of the <ORG> would be defeated Presumably in realisation of this unexpected consequence the <ORG> in the amendment made it clear that the said statement can only be used to contradict a witness in the manner provided by of the Evidence Act By Act of the following sub section was added to The police officer may reduce into writing any statement made to him in the course of an examination under this section and if he does so he shall make a separate record of the statement of each such person whose statement he records This subsection restored the practice obtaining before the year with a view to discourage the practice adopted by some of the police officers of taking a condensed version of the statements of all the witnesses or a precise of what each witness said It is not necessary to notice in detail the changes made in by Act of except to point out that under the amendment the prosecution is also allowed to use the statement to contradict a witness with the permission of the <ORG> and that in view of the shortened committal procedure prescribed copies of the statements of the prosecution witnesses made before the police during investigation are made available by the police to the accused before the commencement of the inquiry or trial The consideration of the provisions of the latest amending Act need not detain us for the present case falls to be decided tinder the Act as it stood before that amendment It is therefore seen that the object of the legislature throughout has been to exclude the statement of a witness made before the police during the investigation from being made use of at the trial for any purpose and the amendments made from time to time were only intended to make clear the said object and to dispel the cloud cast on such intention The Act of for the first time introduced an exception enabling the said statement reduced to writing to be used for impeaching the credit of the witness in the manner provided by the Evidence Act If one could guess the intention of the legislature in framing the section in the manner it did in it would be apparent that it was to protect the accused against the user of the statements of witnesses made before the police during investigation at the trial presumably on the assumption that the said statements were not made under circumstances inspiring confidence Both the section and the proviso intended to serve primarily the same purpose i the interest of the accused A division Bench of <ORG> in <NAME> Emperor expressed a similar idea in regard to the object underlying the section at thus The object of the section is to protect the accused both against over zealous police officers and untruthful witnesses <ORG> in Pakala Narayana Swami The King Emperor found another object underlying the section when they said at If one had to guess at the intention of the <ORG> in framing a section in the words used one would suppose that they had in mind to encourage the free disclosure of information or to protect the person making the statement from a supposed unreliability of police testimony as to alleged statements or both manner which we will indicate at the later stage of the judgment clearly achieves the said objects Section of the Evidence Act it is said empowers the accused to put all relevant questions to a witness before his attention is called to those parts of the writing with a view to contradict him <NAME> describes the procedure to be followed to contradict a witness under of the Evidence Act thus at Resort to section would only be necessary if the witness denies that he made the former statement In that event it would be necessary to prove that he did and if the former statement was reduced to writing then section requires that his attention must be drawn to those parts which are to be used for contradiction But that position does not arise when the witness admits the former statement Section of the Evidence Act is in two parts the first part enables the accused to cross examine a witness as to previous statement made by him in writing or reduced to writing to without such writing being shown to him the second part deals with a situation where the cross examination assumes the shape of contradiction in other words both parts deal with cross examination the first part with cross examination other than by way of contradiction and the The procedure prescribed is that if it is intended to contradict a witness by the writing his attention must before the writing can be proved be called to those parts of it which are to be used for the purpose of contradicting him The proviso to of the Code of Criminal Procedure only enables the accused to make use of such statement to contradict a witness in the manner provided by of the Evidence Act It would be doing violence to the language of the proviso if the said statement be allowed to be used for the purpose of cross examining a witness within the meaning of the first part of of the Evidence Act Nor are we impressed by the argument that it would not be possible to invoke the second part of of the Evidence Act without putting relevant questions under the first part thereof To illustrate A says in the witness box that stabbed before the police he bad stated that stabbed His attention can be drawn to that part of the statement made before the police which contradicts his statement in the witness box If he admits his previous statement no further proof is necessary if he does not admit the practice generally followed is to admit it subject to proof by the police officer On the other hand the procedure suggested by the learned Counsel may be illustrated thus If the witness is asked did you say before the police officer that you saw a gas light and he answers yes then the statement which does not contain such recital is put to him as contradiction This procedure involves two fallacies one is it enables the accused to elicit by a process of cross examination what the witness stated before the police officer If a police officer did not make a record of a witness statement his entire statement could not be used for any purpose whereas if a police officer recorded a few sentences by this process of cross examination the witness oral statement could be brought on record The contradiction under the section should be between what a witness asserted in the witness box and what he stated before the police officer and not between what he said he had stated before the police officer and what he actually made before him This leads us to the main question in the case i the interpretation of of the Code of Criminal Procedure at thus The proper course is to apply the broad general rule of construction which is that a section or enactment must be construed as a whole each portion throwing light if need be on the rest The true principle undoubtedly is that the sound interpretation and meaning of the statute on a view of the enacting clause saving clause and proviso taken and construed together is to prevail Unless the words are clear the <ORG> should not so construe the proviso as to attribute an intention to the legislature to give with one hand and take away with another To put it in other words a sincere attempt should be made to reconcile the enacting clause and the proviso and to avoid repugnancy between the two As the words in the section declare the intention of the legislature we shall now proceed to construe the section giving the words used therein their natural and ordinary sense The object of the main section as the history of its legislation shows and the decided cases indicate is to impose a general bar against the use of statement made before the police and the enacting clause in clear terms says that no statement made by any person to a police officer or any record thereof or any part of such statement or record be used for any purpose The proviso engrafts an exception on the general prohibition and that is the said statement in writing may be used to contradict a witness in the manner provided by of the Evidence Act Indeed in view of the aforesaid facts there is a statutory prohibition against police officers taking the signature of the person making the statement indicating thereby that the statement is not intended to be binding on the witness or an assurance by him that it is a correct statement At the same time it being the earliest record of the statement of a witness soon after the incident any contradiction found therein would be of immense help to an accused to discredit the testimony of a witness making the statement The section was therefore conceived in an attempt to find a happy via media namely while it enacts an absolute bar against the statement made before a police officer being used for any purpose whatsoever it enables the accused to rely upon it for a limited purpose of contradicting a witness in the manner provided by of the Evidence Act by drawing his attention to parts of the statement intended for contradiction Shortly stated there is a general bar against its use subject to a limited exception in the interest of the accused and the exception cannot obviously be used to cross the bar Further there are occasions when we come across two statements made by the same person at different times and both of them cannot stand or co exist There is an inherent repugnancy between the two and therefore if one is true the other must be false Section of the Evidence Act indicates the manner in which contradiction is brought out This indicates that there is something in writing which can be set against another statement made in evidence It is broadly contended that a statement includes all omissions which are material and are such as a witness is expected to say in the normal course As of the Code of Criminal Procedure enables the prosecution in the reexamination to rely upon any part of the statement used by the defence to contradict a witness it is contended that the construction of the section accepted by us would lead to an anomaly namely that the accused cannot ask the witness a Single question which does not amount to contradiction whereas the prosecution taking advantage of a single contradiction relied upon by the accused can reexamine the witness in regard to any matter referred to in his cross examination whether it amounts to a contradiction or not I do not think there is any anomaly in the situation Section of the Evidence Act deals with cross examination in respect of a previous statement made by the witness Section while confining the right to the accused to cross examine the witness in the said manner enables the prosecution to reexamine the witness to explain the matters referred to in the cross examination This enables the prosecution to explain the alleged contradiction by pointing out that if a part of the statement used to contradict be read in the context of any other part it would give a different meaning and if so read it would explain away the alleged contradiction One of the views is tersely put by <NAME> in In re <NAME> at Whether it is considered as a question of logic or language omission and contradiction can never be identical I find myself in complete agreement with the learned Sessions Judge of Ferozepore who observed that a witness cannot be confronted with the unwritten record of an unmade statement The learned Judge gives an illustration of a case of apparent omission which really is a contradiction i a case where a witness stated under of the Code that he saw three persons beating a man and later I Mad In that judgment <NAME> made the following observation at I respectfully agree with the judgment of <NAME> in <NAME> <NAME> in which the learned Judge held that a statement under section of the Code of Criminal Procedure cannot be filed in order to show that a witness is making statements in the witness box which he did not make to the police and that bare omission cannot be a contradiction Therefore if there is no contradiction between his evidence in <ORG> and his recorded statement in the diary the latter cannot be used at all If a witness deposes in <ORG> that a certain fact existed but had stated under either that fact had not existed or that the reverse and irreconcilable fact had existed it is a case of conflict between the deposition in the <ORG> and the statement under and the latter can be used to contradict the former But if he had not stated under anything about the fact there is no conflict and the I Mad statement cannot be used to contradict him In some cases an omission in the statement under may amount to contradiction of the deposition in <ORG> they are the cases where what is actually stated is irreconcilable with what is omitted and impliedly negatives its existence At a later stage of the judgment the learned Judges laid down the following two tests to ascertain whether a particular omission amounts to contradiction i an omission is not a contradiction unless what is actually stated contradicts what is omitted to be said and ii the test to find out whether an omission is contradiction or not is to see whether one can point to any sentence or assertion which is irreconcilable with the deposition in the <ORG> At <ORG> analysing of the Code of Criminal Procedure after its amendment in observed The first proviso to section makes an exception in favour of the accused but it is an exception most jealously circumscribed under the proviso itself Any part of such statement which has been reduced to writing may in certain limited circumstances be used to contradict the witness who made it The limitations are strict Only the statement of a prosecution witness can be used and only if it has been reduced to writing only a part of the statement recorded can be used such part must be duly proved it must be a contradiction of the evidence of the witness in Court it must be used as provided in Evidence Act that is it can only be used after the attention of the witness has been drawn to it or to those parts of it which it is intended to use for the purpose of contradiction and there are others provides that such statements can be used only for the purpose of contradiction The contrary view is expressed in the following proposition An omission may amount to Contradiction if the matter omitted was one which the witness would have been expected to mention and the Sub Inspector to make note of in the ordinary course Those are omissions relating to facts which I Nag are expected to be included in the statement before the police by a person who is giving a narrative of what he saw on the ground that they relate to important features of the incident about which the deposition is made Reliance is placed by the learned Counsel for the appellants on a statement of law found in Wigmore on Evidence Vol In America there is no provision similar to of the Code It is not therefore permissible or even possible to interpret the provisions of a particular Act having regard to stray observations in a text book made in a different context The two conflicting views may be briefly stated thus i omissions unless by necessary implication be deemed to be part of the statement cannot be used to contradict the statement made in the witness box and ii they must be in regard to important features of the incident which are expected to be included in the statement made before the police The first proposition not only carries out the intention of the legislature but is also in accord with the plain meaning of the words used in the section When the section says that the statement is to be used to contradict the subsequent version in the witness box the proposition brings in by construction what he would have stated to the police within the meaning of the word statement From the foregoing discussion the following propositions emerge A statement in writing made by a witness before a police officer in the course of investigation can be used only to contradict his statement in the witness box and for no other purpose statements not reduced to writing by the police officer cannot be used for contradiction though a particular statement is not expressly recorded a statement that can be deemed to be part of that expressly recorded can be used for contradiction not because it is an omission strictly so called but because it is deemed to form part of the recorded statement such a fiction is permissible by construction only in the following three cases i when a recital is necessarily implied from the recital or recitals found in the statement illustration in the recorded statement before the police the witness states that he saw A stabbing at a particular point of time but in the witness box he says that he saw A and stabbing at the same point of time in the statement before the police the word only can be implied i the witness saw A only stabbing ii a negative aspect of a positive recital in a statement illustration in the recorded statement before the police the witness says that a dark man stabbed but in the witness box he says that a fair man stabbed the earlier statement must be deemed to contain the recital not only that the culprit was a dark complexioned man but also that be was not of fair complexion and iii when the statement before the police and that before the <ORG> cannot stand together illustration the witness says in the recorded statement before the police that A after stabbing ran away by a northern lane but in the <ORG> he says that immediatly after stabbing he ran away towards the southern lane as he could not have run away immediately after the stabbing i at the same point of time towards the northern lane as well as towards the southern lane if one statement is true the other must necessarily be false It is for the trial Judge to decide in each case after comparing the part or parts of the statement recorded by the police with that made in the witness box to give a ruling having regard to the aforesaid principles whether the recital intended to be used for contradiction satisfies the requirements of law The learned Counsel for the appellants contends that the accused intended to put to the witnesses the following omissions but they did not do so as the learned Sessions Judge disallowed the two questions put to and made a considered order giving his reasons for doing so and that the learned Counsel thought it proper not to put the same questions or other questions in regard to omissions to or to the other witnesses that followed him Before <ORG> an application was filed for summoning eight eye witnesses on the ground that the learned Sessions Judge did not allow the Counsel for defence to put the omissions amounting to material contradiction to them but no mention was made in that application of the number of omissions which the accused intended to put to the eye witnesses if they were summoned Presumably the <ORG> as well as the parties thought that the application could more conveniently be disposed of after hearing the arguments On July after the appellants were fully heard that application was dismissed and the detailed reasons for dismissing it were given in the judgment which was delivered on September It was not contended on behalf of the accused that other omissions were intended to be used for contradiction but were not put to the witnesses as the Advocate thought that in view of the order of the learned Sessions Judge they would not be allowed automatically The learned Judges held that the said two omissions amounted to material contradiction and that the learned Sessions Judge was wrong in disallowing them but they ignored those two circumstances and based their findings on matters of greater certainty Even if they omitted to mention that fact in the application for special leave they could have filed an affidavit sworn to by the Advocate who appeared for them before the learned Judges of <ORG> mentioning the fact that in spite of the argument specifically directed to the other omissions the learned Judges by mistake or over sight failed to notice that argument But he made strenuous attempts before us to persuade us to hold that there must have been a mistake He would say that the learned Counsel had in fact relied upon all the aforesaid omissions in support of his contention that there was development of the case of the prosecution from time to time and therefore he must have also relied upon the said omissions in the context of the statements made under of the Code of Criminal Procedure on the other hand the fact that the learned Judges considered all the alleged omissions in connection with the said contention and only considered two omissions in regard to the contention based on of the Code is indicative of the fact that the learned Counsel for reasons best known to him did not think fit to rely upon all the alleged omissions the existence of a gas lantern and the scrutiny of the dead bodies by the gang were put to him in cross examination and the learned Sessions Judge disallowed those questions on the ground that the learned Counsel was not able to how any law entitling him to put the said questions It would be seen from the short order made by the learned Sessions Judge at the time each one of the two questions were put that the learned Sessions Judge did not give a general ruling that no omissions in a statement before the police could be put to a witness In their statements before the police they did not mention the said two facts and some of the witnesses stated that there were lanterns From that omission in the statement it cannot necessarily be implied that there was no gas lamp in any part of the locality wherein the incident took place nor can it be said that as the witnesses stated that there were lanterns they must be deemed to have stated that there was no gas lamp for the word lantern is comprehensive enough to take in a gas lantern It is also not possible to state that the statements made before the police and those made before the Court cannot co exist for there is no repugnancy between the two as even on the assumption that lantern excludes a gas lantern both can exist in the scene of occurrence In this view it is unnecessary to express our opinion on the question whether if the said two omissions amounted to contradiction within the meaning of of the Code of Criminal Procedure the appellants were in any way prejudiced in the matter of their trial The learned Judges assumed that the said process was permissible and even on that assumption they rejected the plea of the learned Counsel for the appellants that there was improvement in the prosecution case It is idle to suggest that they erred in law in relying upon the first infor mation report to discredit the witnesses for the simple reason that they accepted the evidence in spite of some omissions in the first information report In the result we confirm the judgment of <ORG> and dismiss the appeal <NAME> <NAME> The judgment which I am delivering has been prepared by my learned brother <NAME> <NAME> and myself We agree that the appeal be dismissed but would express in our own words the grounds upon which it should be dismissed The main contention advanced on behalf of the appellants was as follows There was no fair trial of the appellants as they had been deprived of the right of cross examination of the prosecution witnesses with reference to their statements made to the police during the police investigation The trial Judge had disallowed two questions in this respect and the lawyer for the appellants regarded the decision of the learned Judge as one which prevented him from putting further questions with respect to other matters concerning the police statements of the witnesses There were several matters with respect to which if questions had been allowed to be put an effective cross examination might have resulted and enabled the appellants to persuade the trial Judge to hold that the witnesses were entirely unreliable In a case of this kind in which the appellants were involved there were only two principal questions which were of vital importance how far the witnesses had improved their story in their evidence in <ORG> from what they had said to the police concerning the occurrence and the existence of opportunity and sufficient light to enable proper identification It may be assumed although it has been a matter of controversy that the order of the trial Judge disallowing the two questions which were put was understood by the lawyer for the defence to mean that all similar questions in the nature of omissions in the police statements with respect to matters stated in Court would be disallowed and therefore no attempt was made to put further questions to the witnesses in this respect It could not therefore be said that the trial Judge had done anything which could be rightly characterised as infringement of the provisions of of the Code of Criminal Procedure or of the Indian Evidence Act or even of the rules of natural justice The principal comment had been that in this report there was no mention of the culprits having advanced from the well towards the open place where villagers had gathered to hear the music <NAME> statement made no mention of the culprits uttering any warning that no one was to run away as they advanced from the well whereas in <ORG> the witnesses spoke to that effect <NAME> statement also makes no mention of the culprits examining the bodies of the dead and examining their faces and exclaiming that <NAME> one of the men whom they wished to kill had been killed It is in evidence that the appellants were known for several years to the witnesses who had identified them as participants in the occurrence The statement of <NAME> gives clear indication that the culprits did not remain all the time at the well because they must have advanced to take away the gun which was with <NAME> Reference is made only to some of the details and not to all the discrepancies pointed out in order to determine whether the alleged improvement in the story of the witnesses in <ORG> from what they are alleged to have stated to the police was with reference to vital matters which went to the root of the prosecution case From the above it seems to us that there is no merit in the appeal examination and as to how the provisions of of the Code of Criminal Procedure should be construed it becomes necessary to consider the submissions of the learned counsel for the appellants Criminal Procedure of and have been referred to by our learned brother <NAME> Section of the Code of made it clear that except for a dying declaration and matters coming within the provisions of of the Indian Evidence Act of no statement of any person made to a police officer in the course of in There was no restric tion as to the extent of the right of an accused to cross examine a prosecution witness concerning his statement to the police Section of the Code of prohibited the use of a statement reduced into writing as evidence except any statement falling within the provisions of of the Indian Evidence Act It will be seen therefore that until there was no restriction imposed upon the accused as to the extent of his right of cross examination If however it was intended to contradict a witness concerning his previous statement reduced into writing then the provisions of require that those parts of the writing by which it was sought to contradict the witness must be shown to him The provisions were intended to protect the accused in that no statement of a witness to the police reduced into writing could be used as evidence against him but the right to cross examine the witness to the fullest extent in accordance with the provisions of the Indian Evidence Act in order to show that he was unreliable remained unaffected The real question for consideration is whether the amendment of the Code in brought about such a radical change in the provisions of of the Code as to suggest that the <ORG> had taken a retrograde step and had intended to deprive the accused of the right of cross examination of prosecution witnesses concerning their police statements except in one restricted particular namely to make use of the statements reduced into writing to contradict the witnesses in the manner provided by of the Indian Evidence Act The provisions of of the Code of had been variously construed and the amendment in has not improved matters Under of the Code the police officer may examine orally any person supposed to be acquainted with the facts and circumstances of the case He may also reduce into writing any statement made to him in the course of such examination and if he does so he must make a separate record of the statement of each such person The first restriction is that no statement made by any person to a police officer if reduced into writing be signed by the person making it The legislature next provides that a statement however recorded or any part of it shall not be used for any purpose save as provided in the sections at the inquiry or trial in respect of any offence under investigation at the time such statement is wade <ORG> considered the intention to be If one had to guess at the intention of the legislature in framing a section in the words used one would suppose that they had in mind to encourage the free disclosure of the information or to protect the person making the statement from a supposed unreliability of police testimony as to alleged statements or both It is possible that the legislature had also in mind that the use of statements made under the influence of the investigating agency might unless restricted to a use for the benefit of the accused result in considerable prejudice to him But whatever the intention which led to the imposition of the restrictions it is manifest that the statements however recorded cannot be used except to the extent allowed by the section It also gives a right to the prosecution to use the statement for purposes of reexamination of the same witness but only to explain any matter referred to in the cross examination of the witness The first proviso when analysed gives the following ingredients i A prosecution witness Is called for the prosecution ii whose statement has previously been reduced to writing iii The accused makes a request iv The accused is furnished with a copy of the previous statement In order that any part of such statement if duly proved may be used to contradict such witness in the manner provided by of the Indian Evidence Act If the a accused exercises the right in above in any instance then the prosecution has the right to use the statement in the reexamination of the witness but only to explain any matters referred to by him in cross examination Section of the Indian Evidence Act reads Cross examination as to previous statements in writing A witness may be cross examined as to previous statements made by him in writing or reduced into writing and relevant to matters in question without such writing being shown to him or being proved but if it is intended to contradict him by the writing his attention must before the writing can be proved be called to those parts of it which are to be used for the purpose of contradicting him The section analysed gives the following result Witnesses can be cross examined as to previous statements in writing or reduced into writing These writings need not be shown to the witnesses or proved beforehand But if the intention is to contradict them by the writings a their attention must be drawn to those parts which are to be used for contradiction This should be done before proving the writings Our learned brother <NAME> restricts the use by the accused of the previous statements to the mechanism of contradiction as detailed in above but says that the accused has no right to proceed under and He deduces this from the words of of the Code of Criminal Procedure where it is provided in order that any part of such statement if duly proved may be used to contradict such witness in the manner provided by section of the Indian Evidence Act The fact that the accused can use the previous statement for the purpose of contradicting shows that the previous statement cannot be used for corroborating the witness We regret we cannot agree and we say this with pro found respect that the accused is not entitled to cross examine but only to contradict This question loses much of its importance when there are patent contradictions and they can be put to the witness without any cross examination as in the two statements a I saw A hit I did not see A hit But there are complex situations where the contradiction is most vital and relevant but is not so patent There are cases of omissions on a relevant and material point There is an omission of two facts in the first statement viz What of the Indian Evidence Act provides is that a witness may be contradicted by a statement reduced into writing and that is also the use to which the earlier statement can be put under of the Code of Criminal Procedure When some omissions occur there is contradiction in one sense but not necessarily on a relevant matter What use can be made of such omissions or additions is for the accused to decide but it cannot be doubted that some of the omissions or additions may have a vital bearing upon the truth of the story given Reexamination is only permissible where there is cross examination If the cross examination does anything else it will be barred under which permits the use of the earlier statement for contradicting a witness and nothing else Taking the example given above we do not see why cross examination may not be like this I put it to you that when you arrived on the scene was already running away and you did not actually see him stab as you have deposed to day A No I saw both the events If that is so why is your statement to the police silent as to stabbing A I stated both the facts to the police The witness can then be contradicted with his previous statement But we are of opinion that relevant and material omissions amount to vital contradictions which can be established by cross examination and confronting the witness with his previous statement The word contradict has various Meanings and in the Oxford English Dictionary it is stated as To be contrary to in effect character etc The meaning given to the words contradict and contradiction in these Dictionaries must at least include the case of an omission in a previous statement which by implication amounts to contradiction and therefore such an omission is a matter which is covered by the first proviso to and questions in cross In a civil suit where the provisions of of the Code of Criminal Procedure have no application would it be correct to say that only questions concerning omissions of the kind suggested by our learned brother could be put and none other We cannot see why a question of the nature of cross examination regarding an omission with respect to a matter which the witness omitted to make in his previous statement and which if made would The purpose of cross examination is to test the veracity of the statement made by a witness in his examination in chief as also to impeach his credit According to this interpretation the accused has no right of cross examination in respect of the contradiction This means that no question can be put about the previous statement but only the part in which there is a contradiction can be brought to the witness notice and his explanation if any obtained In other words there is only contradiction and no more But when the accused has used the statement to contradict the witness it may be only on one point what are the rights of the prosecution The prosecution can use any part of the statement in the reexamination not only to explain the I contradiction but also to explain any matter referred to in the cross examination of the witness One wonders if the legislature intended such a result for it is too great a price for the accused to pay for too small a right In our opinion reading the section in this way gives effect to every part and does not lead to the startling and if we may say so the absurd results which we have endeavoured to set out above The question is did the legislature intend giving this right In our opinion the legislature did and for the very obvious reason that it gave the prosecution also a chance to re examine the witness to explain I any matter referred to in the cross examination of the witness This brings us to the consideration of the questions which were asked and disallowed They are Did you state to the investigating officer that the gang rolled the dead bodies of <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> and scrutinized them and did you tell him that the face of <NAME> resembled that of the deceased <NAME> Did you state to the investigating officer about the presence of the gas lantern These questions were defective to start with They did riot set up a contradiction but attempted to obtain from the witness a version of what he stated to the police which is then contradicted In the questions with which we illustrated our meaning the witness was not asked what he stated to the police but was told what he had stated to the police and asked to explain the omission It is to be borne in mind that the statement made to the police is I duly proved either earlier or even later to establish what the witness had then stated In our opinion the two questions were defective for the reasons given here and were properly ruled out even though all the reasons given by the <ORG> may not stand scrutiny The learned Judges of <ORG> ruled out from their consideration that these two circumstances made it possible for the witnesses to recognise the accused but hold that there was ample opportunity even otherwise for the witnesses to do so <ORG> was justified in so doing and there being ample evidence on which they could come to the conclusion that the witnesses had in fact recognised the accused it must inevitably be regarded as one of fact in regard to which this <ORG> does not interfere Since no other point was argued the appeal must fail and we agree that it be dismissed
