All of them relate to the same assessment year they are therefore being disposed of by this common order He made no reference to the case relied upon by the Assessing Officer We have heard the rival submissions Our attention has been invited to the report of computerisation feasibility study a copy of which is available in the paper book It is seen that the principal recommendations were that there was no need for immediate in house installation of computer and it may be deferred for two years There was immediate need for thorough systems study and setting up of a cell for this purpose Further there was a need to advance long term strategy before going into the detailed designing work These recommendations were made after carrying out study of the various functional areas of the assessee company and the attributes of the information which have a bearing on the equipment configuration We find that the matter is covered in favour of the assessee by the decision of the <ORG> in the assessees own case for asst Ground No is reproduced below On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law the learned CIT A erred in directing the Assessing Officer to allow assessees claim of extra shift allowance in proportion of actual number of days during which the factory worked in the relevant previous year The assessee made a claim that extra shift allowance should be given at the rate of of normal depreciation It was provided in the IT Rules that for the purpose of granting extra shift allowance the normal number of working days during the previous year shall be deemed to the number of days on which the concern actually worked during the previous year or days whichever is greater The CIT A discussed the matter in the appellate order and thereafter at the end gave a decision that extra shift allowance in this case will be allowed to the appellant in proportion to the actual number of days during which the factory worked The CIT A has not clarified whether the assessees appeal was being allowed or rejected on this ground and the <ORG> has apparently filed this appeal before us as a measure of precaution We uphold this view since there is no satisfactory basis for reducing the stipulated days to days in the IT Rules as claimed by the assessee The balance amount where individual sums exceeded Rs The CIT A however allowed the entire claim with an observation that he had gone through the details but without any reference to the order of the <ORG> relied upon by the Assessing Officer We have heard the rival submission and according to the learned counsel for the assessee approach should be same as for the other amounts of bad debts totalling to Rs However we do not find any merit in this contention In the present case no efforts were made for recovery at all and allowance had already been made for smaller amounts of Rs Entire medical expenses reimbursed to the employee as forming part of salary We accept the contention Ground No and were considered by the <ORG> in the assessees own case for asst Ground Nos and are reproduced below The CIT A has erred in law and on facts in confirming disallowance under made by the <ORG> The Benches of the Tribunal at Bombay have been following the decision in the case of <ORG> supra and concurring with the same we restore the matter to the Assessing Officer with the direction to consider the deduction under the first proviso to according to law after giving an opportunity of being heard to the assessee However no deduction will be allowed for the amounts of sales tax already deducted in the next year as conceded by the learned counsel for the assessee before us Ground No is reproduced below CIT A has erred in law and on facts in confirming disallowances made by IAC under A of the Act thereby erred in considering a expenditure incurred on payments of restaurants as payments to hotels expenditure incurred on payments of salaries to drivers as expenditure on running and maintenance of motor cars The only point pressed before us during the hearing by the learned counsel for the assessee was that rd of the expenses incurred on payments to restaurants were held in asst After hearing rival submissions we accept this contention and direct that rd of the expenditure on restaurants may be taken outside the purview of A on the basis that they were incurred on the assessees own employees The assessee has filed an additional ground of appeal according to which the CIT A erred in holding that repairs to vehicles ought to be considered for disallowance under A of the Act Ground No is reproduced below The CIT A has erred in law and on facts in confirming disallowance made by <ORG> in respect of customs penalty of Rs The learned counsel for the assessee invited our attention to a copy of the order of the Addl Collector of <ORG> dt However the importer was given an option in lieu of such confiscation of a fine of Rs The learned counsel submitted before us that the goods had been imported in good faith and it was only a matter of interpretation that they were not covered by the licence and in any case the assessee was allowed to redeem the goods in question We have considered the rival submissions In that case in the course of its business the assessee had purchased bills of lading etc It was found at the time of customs clearance that the imports were unauthorised and liable to be confiscated and a penalty was imposed The assessee paid the penalty for saving the goods being confiscated It was held by <ORG> that on the facts and circumstances the actual cost of the goods to the assessee was not only what it had paid to the importers but in addition thereto what it had to pay by way of penalty in order to save the goods from being confiscated The penalty was levied on the assessee for the default of the assessee itself and not on the ground of any other persons default CIT A ought to have given clear direction to the <ORG> to allow as deduction the repayment made to customers during the accounting period of four months ended th April on account of excise duty received from Asstt The <ORG> A observed that the assessee had made claim for deduction in respect of repayment made by them during the accounting period of months ended to th April to the customers on account of excise duty received from the Asstt He therefore declined to consider this additional ground filed before him
