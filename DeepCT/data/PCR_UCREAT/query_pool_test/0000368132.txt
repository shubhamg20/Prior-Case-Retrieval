CASE NO Appeal civil of PETITIONER <ORG> RESPONDENT <NAME> DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH <NAME> <NAME> JUDGMENT SINHA Appellant insurer is before us questioning the correctness or otherwise of a judgment and order dated passed by <ORG> of <ORG> in CIMA of allowing the appeal preferred by the respondent herein from a judgment and order dated passed by <ORG> Respondent herein carries on business in jewellery It obtained a policy known as Jeweller Block Policy Loss or damage occasioned by theft or dishonesty or any attempt there at committed by or where such loss or damage has been expedited or in any way sustained or brought about by a any of the insured family members any servant or traveler or messenger in the exclusive employment of the insured any customer or broker or their customer or angadias or cutters or goldsmiths in respect of the property hereby insured entrusted to them by the insured his or their servants or agents The <ORG> by reason of its order dated inter alia found the said claim to be not sustainable on the ground that the loss was not covered by the said policy stating It appears to us that while preparing the insurance agreement the insurer was aware of the fact that this could be the easiest way for any Jeweller to raise claims against the insurance companies and that is why this clause has been deliberately introduced and theft by customer if any has been put in exclusive clause of the policy <ORG> as indicated hereinbefore by reason of its judgment and order dated did not agree therewith It was held What is meant by the term entrustment does handing over of jewellery to a customer amounts to entrustment If a customer enters the premises of a shopkeeper and examines some movable property and takes away the same then there hardly arises any occasion for entrustment to such a customer There was no entrustment on the part of the owner to the customer A short question which thus arises for our consideration is as to whether clause of the policy is applicable to the facts and circumstances of the present case Wherever such exclusionary clause is contained in a policy it would be for the insurer to show that the case falls within the purview thereof In a case of ambiguity it is trite the contract of insurance shall be construed in favour of the insured Clause of the contract of insurance would be attracted only where the offences specified therein are committed by any of the persons mentioned therein Whoever being in any manner entrusted with property or with any dominion over property dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use that property or dishonestly uses or disposes of that property in violation of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be discharged or of any legal contract express or implied which he has made touching the discharge of such trust or willfully suffers any other person so to do commits criminal breach of trust The word entrust would imply giving responsibility to a person upon whom the owner has confidence For the purpose of arriving at a conclusion as to whether the exclusion clause is attracted or not loss or damage must be occasioned inter alia by a customer in respect of the property entrusted to him There was thus no occasion for the respondent to entrust the jewellery to him Mr <NAME> the learned counsel appearing for the appellant has relied upon the meaning of the word entrust as contained in Black Law Dictionary th Edn Apart from the fact that the said meaning of the term entrustment goes against the submission Mr <NAME> we may notice that in Black Law Dictionary the word entrusting in commercial law has been described as The transfer of possession of goods to a merchant who deals in goods of that type and who may in turn transfer the goods and all rights to them to a purchaser in the ordinary course of business Illustration appended to Section envisages a situation of this nature It by no stretch of imagination would have contemplated a situation where an unknown customer would have committed theft by <NAME> at page it is stated Words in context The above generality is not applicable when it is clear from the context that the words are not used in a colloquial popular sense It has also been held that the phrase sum actually paid in a reinsurance agreement referred to a sum which the reinsured is merely liable to pay as the agreement read as a whole was against liability rather than actual payment In The State of Gujarat <NAME> SCR this Court held The expression entrustment carries with it the implication that the person handing over any property or on whose behalf that property is handed over to another continues to be its owner Further the person handing over the property must have confidence in the person taking the property so as to create a fiduciary relationship between them The entrustment may arise in any manner whatsoever All that is required is what may be described as entrustment or acquisition of dominion over property in the capacity of a public servant who as a result of it becomes charged with a duty to act in a particular way or atleast honestly The positive part deals with criminal misappropriation or conversion of the property and the negative part consists of dishonestly using or disposing of the property in violation of any direction and of law or any contract touching the discharge of trust It may have different implications in different contexts When a person misappropriates to his own use the property that does not belong to him the misappropriation is dishonest even though there was an intention to restore it at some future point of time We in the facts and circumstances of this case also direct the appellant to pay and bear the cost of the respondent throughout Counsel fee in this appeal is assessed at Rs
