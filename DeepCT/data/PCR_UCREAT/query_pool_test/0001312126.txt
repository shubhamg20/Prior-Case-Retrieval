Four persons faced trial for alleged commission of offence punishable under Section read with Section of the Indian Penal Code for short the IPC The matter was carried in appeal before <ORG> which by the impugned order dismissed the appeal filed by the accused appellant and held that accusations under Section have been made out against him who was accused No before the trial Court <NAME> A and <NAME> A were given the benefit of doubt and their acquittal was directed Prosecution version as unfolded during trial is as follows At about a on the deceased and his son <NAME> PW had gone to take tea near the shop of one <NAME> PW On hearing this accused appellant <NAME> took out a pistol from his waist and fired at the deceased The informant with the help of others took him to nearby hospital where he was declared dead The injuries on the accused were not explained by the prosecution and the investigation was perfunctory as is evident from the accepted fact that the medical report of the accused appellant was not even collected and seized bullet was not sent for ballistic examination the accused appellant had taken a definite stand that a shot was fired by the deceased which did not hit him and the deceased and <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> assaulted him and made him senseless That being the position there is no scope for interference in this appeal Further there was a confusion between bullet and pellet which has been clarified by the investigating officer There was not even any suggestion about the defence version to any of the prosecution witnesses and for the first time while giving statement under Section We shall first deal with the question regarding non explanation of injuries on the accused Issue is if there is no such explanation what would be its effect We are not prepared to agree with the learned counsel for the defence that in each and every case where prosecution fails to explain the injuries found on some of the accused the prosecution case should automatically be rejected without any further probe Further those injuries probabilise the plea taken by the appellants It was further observed that In a murder case the non explanation of the injuries sustained by the accused at about the time of the occurrence or in the course of altercation is a very important circumstance from which the Court can draw the following inferences that the prosecution has suppressed the genesis and the origin of the occurrence and has thus not presented the true version that the witnesses who have denied the presence of the injuries on the person of the accused are lying on a most material point and therefore their evidence is unreliable that in case there is a defence version which explains the injuries on the person of the accused assumes much greater importance where the evidence consists of interested or inimical witnesses or where the defence gives a version which competes in probability with that of the prosecution one In <NAME> case supra it is made clear that failure of the prosecution to offer any explanation regarding the injuries found on the accused may show that the evidence related to the incident is not true or at any rate not wholly true But such a non explanation may assume greater importance where the defence gives a version which competes in probability with that of the prosecution But where the evidence is clear cogent and creditworthy and where the <ORG> can distinguish the truth from falsehood the mere fact that the injuries are not explained by the prosecution cannot by itself be a sole basis to reject such evidence and consequently the whole case Much depends on the facts and circumstances of each case Non explanation of injuries by the prosecution will not affect prosecution case where injuries sustained by the accused are minor and superficial or where the evidence is so clear and cogent so independent and disinterested so probable consistent and creditworthy that it outweighs the effect of the omission on the part of prosecution to explain the injuries It is for the defence to put questions to the prosecution witnesses regarding the injuries of the accused persons When that is not done there is no occasion for the prosecution witnesses to explain any injury on the person of an accused State of Bihar AIR SC it was observed that the obligation of the prosecution to explain the injuries sustained by the accused in the same occurrence may not arise in each and every case In other words it is not an invariable rule that the prosecution has to explain the injuries sustained by the accused in the same occurrence If the witnesses examined on behalf of the prosecution are believed by the <ORG> in proof of guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt question of obligation of prosecution to explain injuries sustained by the accused will not arise When the prosecution comes with a definite case that the offence has been committed by the accused and proves its case beyond any reasonable doubt it becomes hardly necessary for the prosecution to again explain how and under what circumstances injuries have been inflicted on the person of the accused In the case at hand trifle and superficial injuries on accused are of little assistance to them to throw doubt on veracity of prosecution case So far as the non seizure of blood from the cot is concerned the investigating officer has stated that he found blood stained earth at the place of occurrence and had seized it That makes a significant factual difference between <NAME> case supra and the present case It has to be noted that there was not even a suggestion to any of the prosecution witnesses that the injuries were sustained by the accused appellant in the manner indicated by him as stated for the first time in the statement under Section In his examination the doctor PW has categorically stated that there was only one injury on the body of the deceased and no other injury was found anywhere on the person of the deceased Though it may not be having any determinative value certain suggestions given to the witnesses make interesting reading A question was put to PW in cross examination which reads as follows It is not correct that Hira Ravindra did not run to catch the accused persons rather they themselves ran away
