Code of Civil Procedure Order Rule proviso Temporary injunction Granting of When <ORG> duty Reasons for grant of injunction Mandatory to record <ORG> directions On the material produced in the case it was treated as a Public Interest Litigation and <ORG> was to rind out a solution in respect if unauthorised constructions alleged to have been made by different owners occupiers builders without sanctioned plans or by making deviations from the sanctioned plans <ORG> disposed of the petition holding that the owners occupiers builders were to be given liberty to file fresh building plans and that <ORG> was to examine such building plans in accordance with law and that the <ORG> was to seal and to demolish those constructions which were beyond the compoundable limits <ORG> also directed that no civil suit would be entertained by any <ORG> in Delhi in respect of any action taken or proposed to be taken by the <ORG> with regard to the sealing and or demolition of any building or any part thereof <ORG> directed further that person aggrieved by an order of sealing or demolition had the right to file an appeal to <ORG> under the Delhi Municipal <ORG> Act Against <ORG> order the present appeals were filed by special leave On the question whether the jurisdiction of the <ORG> has been statutorily barred in respect of suits in connection with the orders passed or proceedings initiated for demolition of constructions which have been made without sanction or by deviating from the sanctioned plans allowing the appeals this <ORG> HELD With the increase in the number of taxing statutes welfare legislations and enactments to protect a class of citizens a trend can be noticed that most of such legislations confer decision making powers on various authorities and they seek to limit or exclude <ORG> power to review those decisions The situation will be different where a statute purports to curb and curtail a pre existing common law right and purports to oust the jurisdiction of the <ORG> so far remedy against the orders passed under such statute are concerned In spite of the bar placed on the power of the <ORG> orders passed under such statutes can be examined on jurisdictional question In spite of the bar prescribed under sub sections and of section and section of the <ORG> Act over the power of the <ORG>s under certain special circumstances the <ORG> can examine whether the dispute falls within the ambit of the Act But once the <ORG> is satisfied that either the provisions of the Act are not applicable to the building in question or the basic procedural requirements which are vital in nature have not been followed it shall have jurisdiction to enquire and investigate while protecting the common law rights of the citizens But at the same time it cannot be held that in all circumstances the authorities entrusted with the demolition of unauthorised constructions have exclusive power to the absolute exclusion of the power of the <ORG> The <ORG> should entertain a suit questioning the validity of an order passed under section of the Act only if the <ORG> is of prima facie opinion that the order is nullity in the eyes of law because of any jurisdictional error in exercise of the power by the Commissioner or that the order is outside the Act A party is not entitled to an order of injunction as a matter of right or course Grant of injunction is within the discretion of the <ORG> and such discretion is to he exercised in favour of the plaintiff only if it is proved to the satisfaction of the <ORG> that unless the defendant is restrained by an order of injunction an irreparable loss or damage will be caused to the plaintiff during the pendency of the suit The <ORG> grants such relief according to the legal principles ex debite justitiae Before any such order is passed the <ORG> must be satisfied that a strong prima facie case has been made out by the plaintiff including on the question of maintainability of the suit and the balance of convenience is in his favour and refusal of injunction would cause irreparable injury to him The <ORG> should be always willing to extend its hand to protect a citizen who is being wronged or is being deprived of a property without any authority in law or without following the procedure which are fundamental and vital in nature But at the same time the judicial proceedings cannot be used to protect or to perpetuate a wrong committed by a person who approaches the <ORG> Power to grant injunction is an extra ordinary power vested in the <ORG> to he exercised taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of a particular case The <ORG>s have to be more cautious when the said power is being exercised without notice or hearing the party who is to he affected by the order so passed In spite of the statutory requirement in order Rule the <ORG>s have been passing orders of injunction before issuance of notices or hearing the parties against whom such orders are to operate without recording the reasons for passing such orders It is said that if the reasons for grant of injunction are mentioned a grievance can be made by the other side that <ORG> has prejudged the issues involved in the suit Apart from that now in view of the proviso to Rule of Order there is no scope for any argument When the statute itself requires reasons to he recorded the <ORG> cannot ignore that requirement by saying that if reasons are recorded it may amount to expressing an opinion in favour of the plaintiff before hearing the defendant Proviso to Rule of Order of the Code attracts the principle that if a statute requires a thing to he done in a particular manner it should be done in that manner or not all <NAME> <NAME> Ch Whenever a <ORG> considers it necessary in the facts and circumstances of a particular case to pass an order of injunction without notice to other side it must record the reasons for doing so and should take into consideration while passing an order of injunction all relevant factors including as to how the object of granting injunction itself shall be defeated if an exparty order is not passed The <ORG> should first direct the plaintiff to serve a copy of the application with a copy of the plaint along with relevant documents on the counsel for the <ORG> or any competent authority of the <ORG> and the order should be passed only after hearing the parties If the circumstances of a case so warrant and where the <ORG> is of the opinion that the object of granting the injunction would be defeated by delay the <ORG> should record reasons for its opinion as required by proviso to Rule of Order of the Code before passing an order for injunction The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> Special leave granted These appeals have been filed against an order passed by <ORG> directing <ORG> hereinafter referred to as the <ORG> to issue appropriate notices to the owners occupiers builders of the building where illegal constructions have been made A liberty has been given to the owners occupiers builders to file fresh buildings plans with the <ORG> in conformity with the existing bye laws The appellants have no grievance so far as the aforesaid part of the order is concerned They have sought interference of this <ORG> with the other part of the order where it has been said that no civil suit will be entertained by any court in Delhi in respect of any action taken or proposed to be taken by the <ORG> with regard to the sealing and or demolition of any building or any part thereof Any person aggrieved by an order of sealing or demolition which is passed shall however have the right of filing an appeal to <ORG> under the Municipal Act <ORG> is the only forum which has the jurisdiction to grant interim relief The other part of the order in respect of which objection has been taken is where the <ORG> has directed the <ORG> to approach those courts which have already issued injunction for variation and vacation of the injunction orders in the light of the said order In due course on the material produced by one party or the other it was treated as a Public Interest Litigation and by the impugned order <ORG> has purported to find out a solution in respect of unauthorised constructions alleged to have been made by different owners occupiers builders in the different parts of the city without sanctioned plans or by making deviations from the plans which had been sanctioned It cannot be disputed that by the impugned order the jurisdiction of any Court in Delhi to entertain any suit in connection with demolition of any part of any building which according to the <ORG> is unauthorised and illegal has been ousted The Delhi Municipal <ORG> Act hereinafter referred to as the <ORG> Act has made provisions for the constitution of the <ORG> and has prescribed the procedure for election of the councillors levy of taxes sanitation and public health Chapter XVI contains provisions regarding erection of buildings within the <ORG> area Section defines the expression to erect a building Order of demolition and stoppage of buildings and works in certain cases and appeal Any person aggrieved by an order of the Commissioner made under sub section may prefer an appeal against the order to <ORG> within the period specified in the order for the demolition of the erection or work to which it relates Where an appeal is preferred under sub section against an order of demolition <ORG> may subject of the provisions of sub section of section stay the enforcement of that order on such terms if any and for such period as it may think fit Provided that where the erection of any building or execution of any work has not been completed at the time of the making of the order of demolition no order staying the enforcement of the order of demolition shall be made by <ORG> unless security sufficient in the opinion of the said <ORG> has been given by the appellant for not proceeding with such erection or work pending the disposal of the appeal Subject to an order made by the Administrator on appeal under section every order made by <ORG> on appeal under this section and subject to the orders of the Administrator and <ORG> on appeal Section vests power in the Commissioner to stop the construction of the building where the erection of such building or execution of any work has been commenced or is being carried on either without sanction or contrary to sanction so granted or in contravention of any condition subject to which sanction has been accorded Under section A the Commissioner at any time before or after making an order of demolition under section or of the stoppage of the erection of any building or execution of any work under section can make an order directing the sealing of such erection or work or of the premises in which such erection or work is being carried or has been completed After the commencement of section of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Amendment Act no court shall entertain any suit application or other proceedings in respect of any order or notice appealable under section or section and no such order or notice shall be called in question otherwise then by preferring an appeal under these sections Notwithstanding anything contained in sub section every suit application or other proceeding pending in any court immediately before the commencement of section of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Amendment Act in respect of any order or notice appealable under section or section shall continue to be dealt with and disposed of by that court as if the said section had not been brought into force In spite of several pronouncements of this <ORG> during the last four decades the question as to whether the jurisdiction of the <ORG> has been statutorily barred in respect of suits in connection with the orders passed or proceedings initiated for demolition of constructions which have been made without sanction or by deviating from the sanctioned plans has to be answered Section of the Code of Civil Procedure hereinafter referred to as the Code says that <ORG>s shall have jurisdiction to try all suits of civil nature except suits of which their cognizance is either express Iyor impliedly barred According to the <ORG> once the jurisdiction of the <ORG> to try a suit in which the validity of any order passed under the provisions of the <ORG> Act or the notice issued thereunder has been specifically barred and an internal remedy has been provided for redressal of the grievances of the persons concerned there is no scope for <ORG> to entertain a suit The result was that any person having a grievance that he had been wronged or his fight was being affected could approach the ordinary <ORG> on the principle of law that where there is a right there is a remedy ubi jus ibi remedium As no internal remedy had been provided in the different statutes creating rights or liabilities the ordinary <ORG>s had to examine the grievances in the light of different statutes It may be pointed out that many statutes have created certain rights or liabilities and have also provided the remedial measures in respect thereof But there are some statutes which in public interest affect even the common law rights or liabilities of toe citizen which were in the nature of existing rights In one of the earliest case of <ORG> <NAME> <NAME> said There are three classes of cases in which a liability may be established founded upon a statute One is where there was a liability existing at common law and that liability is affirmed by a statute which gives a special and peculiar form of remedy different from the remedy which existed at common law there unless the statute contains words which expressly or by necessary implication exclude the common law remedy and the party suing has his election to pursue either that or the statutory remedy The second class of cases is where the statute gives the right to sue merely but provides no particular form of remedy there the party can only proceed by action at common law But there is a third class viz where a liability not existing at common law is created by a statute which at the same time gives a special and particular remedy for enforcing it The present case falls within this latter class if any liability at all exists The remedy provided by the statute must be followed and it is not competent to the party to pursue the course applicable to cases of the second class In <NAME> <NAME> AC it was said I do not think the appellant can claim to recover by virtue of the statute and at the same time insist upon doing so by means other than those prescribed by the statute which alone confers the right It was further pointed out The right and the remedy are given uno flatu and the one cannot be dissociated from the other It is also well settled that even if jurisdiction is so excluded <ORG> have jurisdiction to examine into cases where the provisions of the Act have not been complied with or the statutory tribunal has not acted in conformity with the fundamental principle of judicial procedure But having enunciated the general principle in respect of ouster of the jurisdiction of <ORG> it was said But in their Lordships opinion neither Sec nor the principle involved in the decision in A affect the validity of an Act of the Indian Legislature which creates an obligation and provides an exclusive Code for its determination such an obligation is not covered by sub of Section Ludhiana AIR SC it was said that where a statute created a liability and provided a remedy party aggrieved should pursue the remedy provided under the Act It was pointed out that there was an express and unambiguous prohibition and no suit could be entertained by <ORG> That may be aggrieved by the relevant order and as such the jurisdiction of <ORG> had been ousted This very question was examined in State of Kerala MI <NAME> and sons AIR SC in connection with the Travancore Cochin General Sales Tax Act and it was held that the jurisdiction of <ORG> would be deemed to have been excluded because the legislature had set up a special tribunal to determine the question relating to rights or liabilities which had been created by the statute The Constitution Bench in <NAME> State of Madya Pradesh AIR SC said Where there is an express bar of the jurisdiction of the court an examination of the scheme of the particular Act to find the adequacy or the sufficiency of the remedies provided may be relevant but is not decisive to sustain the jurisdiction of the civil court Where there is no express exclusion the examination of the remedies and the scheme of the particular Act to find out the intendment becomes necessary and the result of the inquiry may be decisive In the latter case it is necessary to see if the statute creates a special right or a liability and provides for the determination of the right or liability and further lays down that all questions about the said right and liability shall be determined by the tribunals so constituted and whether remedies normally associated with actions in civil courts are prescribed by the said statute or not AIR SC SCC it was pointed out that <ORG> will have no jurisdiction to try and adjudicate upon an industrial dispute if it concerned enforcement of certain right or liability created only under the Act Chheharta AIR SC SCC and it was held Where a Revenue Statute provides for a person aggrieved by an assessment thereunder a particular remedy to be sought in a particular forum in a particular way it must be sought in that forum and in that manner and all other forums and modes of seeking it are excludes The jurisdiction of <ORG> to entertain a suit for ejectment was examined in <NAME> GobindRam Bohra SCC and it was held that the Rent Control Act was a complete Code and the jurisdiction to try a case for ejectment was exclusive under that Act With the increase in the number of taxing statutes welfare legislations and enactments to protect a class of citizens a trend can be noticed that most of such legislations confer decision making powers on various authorities and they seeks to limit or exclude <ORG> power to review those decisions But the situation will be different where a statute purports to curb and curtail a pre existing common law right and purports to oust the jurisdiction of the <ORG> so far remedy against the orders passed under such statute are concerned First <ORG>s have jurisdiction to examine into cases where the provisions of the Act have not been complied with or the statutory tribunal has not acted in conformity with the fundamental principles of judicial procedure The question as to whether any particular case falls under the first or the second of the above categories would depend on the purpose of the statute and its general scheme taken in conjunction with the scope of the enquiry entrusted to the tribunal set up and other relevant factors In that connection it was said The appellant company are given no new right of quarrying by the Act of On the contrary they deny that they come within its purview and seek a declaration to that effect orders passed under such statutes can be examined on jurisdictional question To illustrate a special machinery has been provided for removal of the encroachments from public land under different enactments in different states and the jurisdiction of the <ORG> has been barred in respect of the orders passed by such special tribunals or authorities constituted under such Acts In the case of <ORG> <ORG> AC a wide interpretation has been given to the word jurisdiction by <ORG> It was pointed out that in many cases where although the <ORG> has jurisdiction to enter upon an enquiry it has done or failed to do something in the course of such enquiry which is of such a nature that its decision becomes a nullity By mere reference to different provisions of the Corporation Act it shall appear that the Act does not create any right or liability In view of the Provisions of the Act whenever it is discovered that erection of any building or execution of any work has been commenced or is being carried or has been completed either without sanction or contrary to the sanction or in contravention of any condition subject to which such sanction had been accorded the Commissioner can make an order directing that such erection or work shall be demolished Any person aggrieved by an order has been given a right to prefer an appeal before <ORG> and thereafter to the Administrator Subject to any order passed by the Appellate <ORG> and the Administrator the order for demolition shall be deemed to be final and conclusive According to us it cannot be urged that the provisions of the Act have created any right or liability and for enforcement thereof remedy has been provided under the Act itself But as the provisions of the Act intend to regulate and restrict a common law right and not any right liability created under the Act itself it cannot be said that the right and the remedy have become given uno flatu in the same breath Most of the cases of this Court referred to above related to statutes creating rights or liabilities and providing remedies at the same time In spite of the bar prescribed under sub sections and of section and section of the <ORG> Act over the power of the <ORG> under certain special circumstances the Court can examine whether the dispute falls within the ambit of the Act But once the Court is satisfied that either the provisions of the Act are not applicable to the building in question or the basic procedural requirements which are vital in nature have not been followed it shall have jurisdiction to enquire and investigate while protecting the common law rights of the citizens But at the same time it cannot be held that in all circumstances the authorities entrusted with the demolition of unauthorised constructions have exclusive power to the absolute exclusion of the power of the <ORG> The Court should entertain a suit questioning the validity of an order passed under section of the Act TEMPORARY INJUNCTION It need not be said that primary object of filing a suit challenging the validity of the order of demolition is to restrain such demolition with the intervention of the <ORG> It has been pointed out repeatedly that a party is not entitled to an order of injunction as a matter of right or course Grant of injunction is within the discretion of the <ORG> and such discretion is to be exercised in favour of the plaintiff only if it is proved to the satisfaction of the <ORG> that unless the defendant is restrained by an order of injunction an irreparable loss or damage will be caused to the plaintiff during the pendency of the suit The <ORG> grants such relief according to the legal principles ex debite justitiae Before any such order is passed the <ORG> must be satisfied that a strong primafacie case has been made out by the plaintiff including on the question of maintainability of the suit and the balance of convenience is in his favour and refusal of injunction would cause irreparable injury to him Under the changed circumstance with so many cases pending in <ORG>s once an interim order of injunction is passed in many cases such interim orders continue for months if not for years The court should be always willing to extent its hand to protect a citizen who is being wronged or is being deprived of a property without any authority in law or without following the procedure which are fundamental and vital in nature used to protect or to perpetuate a wrong committed by a person who approaches the <ORG> Power to grant injunction is an extraordinary power vested in the <ORG> to be exercised taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of a particular case The <ORG>s have to be more cautious when the said power is being exercised without notice or hearing the party who is to be affected by the order so passed That is why Rule of Order of the Code requires that in ail cases the <ORG> shall before grant of an injunction direct notice of the application to be given to the opposite party except where it appears that object of granting injunction itself would be defeated by delay By the Civil Procedure Code Amendment Act a proviso has been added to the said rule saying that where it is proposed to grant an injunction without giving notice of the application to the opposite party the <ORG> shall record the reasons for its opinion that the object of granting the injunction would be defeated by delay It has come to our notice that in spite of the aforesaid statutory requirement the <ORG> have been passing orders of injunction before issuance of notices or hearing the parties against whom such orders are to operate without recording the reasons for passing such orders It is said that if the reasons for grant of injunction are mentioned a grievance can be made by the other side that <ORG> has prejudged the issues involved in the suit Apart from that now in view of the proviso to Rule aforesaid there is no scope for any argument The imperative nature of the proviso has to be judged in the context of Rule of Order of the Code Before the Proviso aforesaid was introduced Rule said the <ORG> shall in all cases except where it appears that the object of granting the injunction would be defeated by the delay before granting an injunction direct notice of the application for the same to be given to the opposite party The proviso was introduced to provide a condition where <ORG> proposes to grant an injunction without giving notice of the application to the opposite party being of the opinion that the object of granting injunction itself shall be defeated by delay In this background the requirement for recording the reasons for grant of ex parte injunction cannot be held to be a mere formality This requirement is consistent with the principle that a party to a suit who is being restrained from exercising a right which such party claims to exercise either under a statute or under the common law must be informed why instead of following the requirement of Rule the procedure prescribed under the proviso has been followed The party who invokes the jurisdiction of the <ORG> for grant of an order of restraint against a party without affording an opportunity to him of being heard must satisfy the <ORG> about the gravity of the situation and <ORG> has to consider briefly these factors in the ex parts order We are quite conscious of the fact that there are other statutes which contain similar provisions requiring the <ORG> or the authority concerned to record reasons before exercising power vested in them In respect of some of such provisions it has been held that they are required to be complied with but non compliance there of will not vitiate the order so passed But same cannot be said in respect of the proviso to Rule of Order Such ex parte orders have far reaching effect as such a conditions has been imposed that <ORG> must record reasons before passing such order Proviso to Rule of Order of the Code attracts the principle that if a statute requires a thing to be done in a particular manner it should be done in that manner or not all It must record the reasons for doing so and should take into consideration while passing an order of injunction all relevant factors including as to how the object of granting injunction itself shall be defeated if an ex parte order is not passed Accordingly we direct that the application for interim injunction should be considered and disposed of in the following manner i The Court should first direct the plaintiff to serve a copy of the application with a copy of the plaint along with relevant documents on the counsel for the <ORG> or any competent authority of the <ORG> and the order should be passed only after hearing the parties ii If the circumstances of a case so warrant and where the <ORG> is of the opinion that the object of granting the injunction would be defeated by delay the <ORG> should record reasons for its opinion as required by proviso to Rule of order of the Code before passing an order for injunction In the result the appeals are allowed to the extent indicated above
