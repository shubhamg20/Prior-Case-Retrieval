The State of Maharashtra is not prepared to reconcile with the clean chit granted to him by <ORG> and hence this appeal by special leave has been filed by the State The life of <NAME> was snuffed off on As per the prosecution version the accused who is respondent in this appeal was already an accused in another case facing ah allegation that he committed rape and murder of one eight year old female child by name <NAME> After such release from jail respondent visited <NAME> house and subsequently he paid frequent visits to the said house On respondent went to that house and when he was told that <NAME> had gone out he left the house There were number of contusions and abrasions on her face also The Sessions Judge found that all those circumstances were established and they formed themselves into a completed chain unerringly pointing to the guilt of the respondent The circumstances which prosecution presented can be recast as follows Respondent visited the house of <NAME> at about and after he left the house it was realised that <NAME> also disappeared PW Mahadeo saw the accused and a female child together in his shop at about on the same days PW Motiram saw them together in his shop at about A little later PW Sayyed Niyamat saw them walking along the road Respondent after his arrest disclosed to PW Pursuant thereto the spot was pointed out by the respondent wherefrom the dead body was recovered PW Dr <NAME> stated that the person who caused the injuries on the vagina of the deceased child would have sustained injuries on his male organ <ORG> sidestepped the circumstance that semen and blood were detected on the under clothes of the accused on the premise that there was delay in seizing those wearing apparels In a test identification parade conducted by PW Magistrate he identified the respondent as the person who accompanied the child <NAME> gave evidence that when he was returning from his Friday Namaz he saw a young man holding a crying girl around He too gave almost the same reason for remembering it that when he heard next day about the murder of a little girl he had some doubt whether it was the same crying girl So he informed the police about it He too was called in the Test Identification Parade wherein he identified the respondent as the person whom he saw with the girl Such a reasoning overlooks the broad aspect that a human mind on hearing about any shocking incident would have the tendency to recollect any previous event which could have had a connection with that incident If as a matter of fact those witnesses had occasion to see a crying girl of that age on the very day of the gruesome episode as happened in this case there is nothing improbable in those witnesses remembering the person who was seen in the company of that girl If they had immediately informed the police that they noticed a similarly aged girl crying in the company of an utter stranger of that locality that cannot be brushed aside as a doubtful conduct They said that they went to the police station on whereas PW Police Inspector said that they visited me police station only on We do not attach any significance to the aforesaid discrepancy as PW should have been more correct because he was speaking with the help of investigation records while the witnesses would have spoken from their memory only It is not for the <ORG> to suggest that he should have divulged it to the members of the bereaved family despite his own thinking about it At any rate we are not impressed by the aforesaid reasoning for rejecting the testimony of an important witness like PW For considering that reasoning it must be remembered that <NAME> would certainly have been abducted by some body even assuming that it was not this respondent and that person had taken the abducted girl from her house up to the farm Unless it is suggested that there was another alternative and safer route for the culprit to take the girl unnoticed by any shopkeeper or even a pedestrian there in no rationale in the reasoning that there is inherent incredibility in the version that respondent would have taken the girl through this route It contains the details of the steps adopted by him We remind ourselves that identification parades are not primarily meant for the court and the admissible portion of it reads thus Her dead body is kept concealed in the field I will take it out and produce the same come with me The first limb of that reasoning was based on a mistake committed by PW <NAME> in his evidence when he said that he saw the dead body of the child on Much strain is not required in holding that what PW said should have been understood as The second limb of the reasoning is that two other possibilities could not have been ruled out We have pointed out earlier the injuries which the doctor had noted on the person of the accused when he was examined on The significant impact of the said incriminating circumstance is that the accused could not give any explanation whatsoever for those injuries and therefore he had chosen to say that he did not sustain any such injury at all We have no reason to disbelieve the testimony of PW Dr <NAME> False answer Offered by the accused when his attention was drawn to the aforesaid circumstance renders that circumstance capable of inculpating him In a situation like this such a false answer can also be counted as providing a missing link for completing the chain It is disconcerting that a case like his in which the prosecution has presented such reliable and formidable circumstances forming into a completed chain and pointing unerringly to me irresistible conclusion mat the little girl <NAME> was raped and killed by none other than the respondent himself ended in unmerited acquittal from <ORG> of <ORG> unfortunately became a casualty in this case when the High Curt side stepped all such circumstances and exonerated the culprit of such a grotesque crime We therefore set aside the impugned judgment and restore the conviction passed by the trial court However the lesser option is not unquestionably foreclosed and so we alter the sentence in regard to the offence under Section to imprisonment for life The sentences imposed by the trial court on all other counts would remain unaltered We direct the respondent to surrender to bail We also direct the Sessions Judge <NAME> to take immediate and necessary steps to put the accused in jail if he is not already in jail for undergoing the sentence imposed on him
