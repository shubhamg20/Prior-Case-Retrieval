Rule of the Seniority Rules provides that the year of allotment of an officer appointed to the service by promotion shall be the Year of allotment of the junior most direct recruit who officiated continuously in a senior post from a date earlier than the date of commencement of continuous officiation by the promotee The second proviso to the rule provides that an officer shall be deemed to have officiated continuously in a senior post prior to the date of the inclusion of his name in the Select List if the period of such officiation was approved by <ORG> In he was confirmed as and he was officiating continuously from to in senior officiating appointments of the <ORG> His name was included in the List of officers considered suitable for pro motion which was approved by the <ORG> on September and in similar fit for trial lists prepared for the years and <ORG> decided that the officiation in the senior posts of the officers included in the fit for trial lists could not be counted for the purpose of determining the seniority of such officers under the Seniority Rules The respondent filed a writ petition in <ORG> contending that Rule is not governed by its second proviso that his case was governed by the main and on the basis of his continuous officiation in a senior post as an officer included in the Select List of the years and approved by the <ORG> and accepted by <ORG> his year of allotment should be which was the year of allotment of a junior most direct recruit officer who officiated continuously in a senior post from a date earlier than the date of commencement of the officiation by the respondent Even if the second proviso governed the main and only the list of February was the Select List his year of allotment should be on the basis that his continuous officiation throughout from to was approved by <ORG> by inclusion in the approved lists The choice of February mentioned in <ORG> communication dated July was arbitrary and There was discrimination between him and another officer In appeal to this Court HELD The object of the second proviso is to cut down the period of officiation which could be taken into consideration under Though in the letter of July there was a reference to a list called fit for continuous officiation list there was in fact no such list and the expression referred only to the list of November of officers for promotion in an officiating capacity In the present case <ORG> after applying its mind to the problem approved the period from February to July and there was no evidence to show that the period of officiation prior to February of the respondent was approved by <ORG> It has a definite relation to the question of approved period of officiation becaue it was on that date that the <ORG> approved the inclusion of the respondent in the list for officiating appointment for the first time after the Promotion Regulation had come into force There was no discrimination between the respondent and the In this petition the petitioner had prayed for a writ of mandamus directing the respondents to fix the petitioner seniority and year of allotment as instead of the year fixed by <ORG> In order to appreciate the points raised before us it is necessary to set out the facts somewhat in detail This agreement provided for various matters such as the strength including both the number and character of posts of <ORG> the method of recruitment to the Service framing of rules regarding conditions of service the penalties which could be imposed etc In order to ensure that the conditions of service applicable to officers of <ORG> are as uniform as possible rules regulating pay and other conditions of services will be framed by <ORG> to such extent as may be considered necessary In respect of matters not covered by the said rules an officer of <ORG> will be governed by such rules as may be framed by the <ORG> under which he is for the time being serving and if no such rules are framed by the rules applicable to the Central Service Provincial Police Service Class as the case may be Section enabled <ORG> to make rules for the regulation of recruitment and conditions of service of persons appointed to an <ORG> which was defined to include among others <ORG> On April <ORG> wrote to the Secretary <ORG> that they proposed to hold a meeting of the committee to be constituted in accordance with rule of the Draft Rules sometime in June with a view to prepare a select list of officers suitable for promotion to <ORG> On September the <ORG> approved the recommendation of the above committee which met to prepare the select list for promotion to <ORG> and agreed to the select list as drawn up by the <ORG> On August his name again appeared in the list which we may call fit for trial list His name also appeared in a similar list on July One of the questions which has to be decided in this case is whether these lists can come within the expression select list used in the second proviso in of the Indian Police Service Regulation of Seniority Rules hereinafter referred to as the Seniority Rules which came into force on September In this meeting the <ORG> selected and recommended officers for officiating appointment in the <ORG> and the petitioner name appeared as No in the List On January the <ORG> replied as follows I am directed to refer to <NAME> <NAME> letter No AIS I dated the th Dec The Committee only recommended officers who were considered suitable to hold <ORG> cadre posts in an officiating capacity that the fit for trial list being not a list envisaged under the Indian Administrative Service Indian Police Service Appointment by Promotion Regulations any officiation of an officer included in the fit for trial list cannot be taken as approved officiation for purposes of seniority and On May <ORG> wrote to the State Governments and observed The question whether the officiation in senior posts of the State Civil Service State Police Officer after in clusion of their names in the fit for trial list should or should not be taken into account for the purpose of seniority on their subsequent appointment to <ORG> <ORG> has been engaging the attention of <ORG> for some time past <ORG> who were consulted in this respect have advised that any officiation of State Civil Service State Police Service officers included in the fit for trial list should not be taken into account to determine their seniority in <ORG> <ORG> counted for the purpose of determining the seniority of such officers under <ORG> <ORG> Regulation of Seniority Rules It stated The approved continuous officiation of these officers counting for seniority commenced from the th February the date on which <ORG> approved the fit for continuous officiation list containing their names This date being later than the date i on which <NAME> started officiating in the senior posts but earlier than the date on which regular recruits of started officiating it has been decided that these officers may be finally allotted to and placed SupCI en bloc below <NAME> and above <NAME> It is this order which has been quashed by <ORG> The learned Attorney General who appears for the appellant urges that the case of the petitioner is covered by the second proviso to of the Seniority Rules and is not governed only by He urges that the lists of and mentioned above were not Select Lists within the meaning of the second proviso and it is only the Select List which was made on February which is the Select List within the second proviso and that there has been no discrimination or breach of art He says that the Select List of was a Select List within the meaning of the second proviso and the seniority of the petitioner should be counted from that date In the alternative he contends that the petitioner officiation in senior posts prior to July had in fact been approved and was approved officiation within the second proviso He further contends that the date February mentioned in the order dated July is an arbitrary date and the Government has in fact not applied its mind to the question He further says that there has been discrimination and one <ORG> has been given benefit which has been denied to the petitioner The main point that arises in this case is whether the Select Lists of and can be deemed to be treated as Select Lists within the second proviso It is necessary to set out rule of the Seniority Rules in order to deal with this point Assignment of Year of Allotment Every officer shall be assigned a year of allotment in accordance with the provisions hereinafter contained in this rule The year of allotment of an officer in service at the commencement of these rules shall be the same as has been assigned to him or may be assigned to him by <ORG> in accordance with the orders and instructions in force immediately before the commencement of these rules Provided that where the year of allotment of an officer appointed in accordance with rule of the Re cruitment Rules has not been determined prior to the commencement of these Rules his year of allotment shall be determined in accordance with the provision in clause of sub rule of this rule and for this purpose such officer shall be deemed to have officiated in a senior post only if and for the period for which he was approved for such officiation by <ORG> in consultation with the <ORG> The year of allotment of an officer appointed to the Service after the commencement of these rules shall be a where the officer is appointed to the Service on the results of a competitive examination the year following the year in which such examination was held where the officer is appointed to the Service by promotion in accordance with rule of the Recruitment Rules the year of allotment of the junior most among the officers recruited to the Service in accord ance with rule of those Rules who officiated continuously in a senior post from a date earlier than the date of commencement of such officiation by the former Provided that the year of allotment of an officer appointed to the Service in accordance with rule of the Recruitment Rules who started officiating continuously in a senior post from a date earlier than the date on which any of the officers recruited to the Service in accordance with rule of those Rules so started officiating shall be determined ad hoc by <ORG> in consultation with <ORG> con cerned Provided further that an officer appointed to the Service after the commencement of these Rules in accordance with rule of the Recruitment Rules shall be deemed to have officiated continuously in a senior post prior to the date of the inclusion of his name in the Select List prepared in accordance with the recruitment of the Indian Police Service Appointment by Promotion Regulations framed under rule of the Recruitment Rules if the period of such officiation prior to that date is approved by <ORG> in consultation with the Commission Explanation An officer shall be deemed to have officiated continuously in a senior post from a certain date if during the period from that date to the date of his confirmation in the senior grade he continues to hold without any break or reversion a senior post otherwise than as a purely temporary or local arrangement An officer shall be treated as having officiated in a senior post during any period in respect of which <ORG> concerned certifies that he would have so officiated but for his absence on leave or appointment to any special post or any other exceptional circumstance The committee shall prepare a list of such members of <ORG> as satisfy the condition specified in regulation and as are held by the committee to be suitable for promotion to the Service Draft rule provided that <ORG> should invite <ORG> to depute one of their members to preside at the meetings of the <ORG> No officer shall be included in the list who has not definitely proved his fitness for such appointment This takes us to the next point whether the petitioner is governed by the main portion of rule and not by the second proviso In our opinion the object of the second proviso is to cut down the period of officiation which would be taken into consideration under rule The object of Explanation I is to deal with the problem arising in the case of officers holding appointments as a purely temporary or local arrangement No material has been brought to our notice to show that <ORG> did not apply its mind to the problem There is no doubt from the correspondence we have set out above that <ORG> were quite aware of the requirements of a <ORG> list It has definite relation to the question of approved period of officiation because it is on this date that <ORG> approved the inclusion of the petitioner in the list for officiating appointment for the first time after the Promotion Regulations had come into force The learned counsel has taken us through the correspondence The learned Attorney General had raised the point that all the officers who were likely to be affected by the decision of the writ petition had not been impleaded as parties to the petition and he referred to us the decision of this <ORG> in <NAME> Union of India where <NAME> speaking for the <ORG> observed But we are unable to investigate the question whether there has been infringement of the rules governing fixation of seniority for a majority of those who were placed above the appellant in the seniority list are not impleaded in the petition before the Judicial Commissioner and are not before this Court It is impossible to pass an order assuming that the appellant is able to convince us that a breach of the rules was committed altering the list of seniority unless those who are Civil Appeal No of Judgment dated August likely to be affected thereby are before the <ORG> and have an opportunity of replying to the case set up by the appellant But as we are allowing the appeal it is not necessary to finally decide whether the petition should have been dismissed only on this ground In the result the appeal is allowed the judgment and order of <ORG> set aside and the petition dismissed but there will be no order as to costs here and in <ORG>
