<ORG> servant acting in capacity of Corporation sole Allegations of misconduct in discharge of duties Whether disciplinary proceedings can be taken against him under Or whether his decisions can only be questioned in appeal or revision Whether suspension under can be ordered only after framing of charges under Whether leases for over five years required to be by public auction Whether Commissioner can himself initiate proposals of leases HEADNOTE While the appellant who was a member of <ORG> and the First Member of <ORG> Kerala State was holding the post of Commissioner of <ORG> certain complaints were made against him relating to the grant of certain leases The appellant filed a petition for the grant of a writ of certiorari to quash the proceedings initiated against him and for a writ of mandamus calling upon <ORG> to permit him to function as the First Member of <ORG> In the meantime the Enquiry Officer having submitted a report to <ORG> finding the appellant guilty of some of the charges a show cause notice was issued to him In appeal to this Court it was contended inter alia for the appellant i that in view of of Madras Act XIX of which provides that the Commissioner shall be a Corporation sole a person acting in the capacity of a Commissioner is not a <ORG> servant and there was therefore no jurisdiction to take disciplinary proceedings against him under Rule ii that the Commissioner was exercising aquasijudicial function in sanctioning leases under the Act which were the subject matter of the complaints against him his orders could therefore only be questioned in appeal as provided under of the Act or examined by the <ORG> in revision under and not by the executive <ORG>al through disciplinary proceedings iii that the main charge against the appellant was not sustainable there was nothing improper in his having sanctioned leases for over five years without auction or in his having initiated proposals for leases in favour of specified individuals iv that the proceedings under Rule were invalid as there was no formal order instituting these proceedings and that the appellant could not be suspended until after charges had been framed against him There was no force in the contention that the Commissioner has a separate legal personality as corporation sole and is therefore exempt from disciplinary proceedings ii The allegations against the appellant were to the effect that in exercising his powers as Commissioner he acted in abuse of his powers and it was in regard to such misconduct that he was being proceeded against Rule requiring public auction framed under covers all leases and there is no exception in respect of leases exceeding years failing within the scope of Furthermore the Commissioner has no power under to initiate specific proposals for lease of the trust properties There was therefore no formal order necessary to initiate disciplinary proceedings under Rule of the Rules and the order passed by <ORG> must be deemed to be an order under Rule of the Rules initiating disciplinary proceedings The word charges in Rule should be given a wider meaning as denoting the accusations or imputations against the member of the <ORG> Appeal from the judgment and order dated January of <ORG> in Original Petition No of The appellant appeared in person The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This appeal is brought by certificate against the judgment of <ORG> dated January dismissing Original Petition No of filed by the appellant Member of <ORG> Kerala State and was holding the post of Commissioner of <ORG> On the basis of certain petitions containing allegations of misconduct against the appellant in the discharge of his duties as Commissioner <ORG> instituted certain preliminary enquiries and thereafter started disciplinary proceedings against the appellant and also placed him under suspension under rule of the All India Services Discipline and Appeal Rules hereinafter called the Rules A copy of the charges together with a statement of certain allegations was served on the appellant who thereafter filed a written statement of defence After perusing the written statement the Government passed orders that his explanation was unacceptable and that the charges should be enquired into by an Enquiry Officer to be appointed under rule of the Rules The appellant then filed the present writ petition before <ORG> Kerala praying for grant of a writ of certiorari to quash the proceedings initiated against him and for a writ of mandwmus calling upon As no application for stay was made and as no order of stay Was passed by <ORG> Sri <NAME> proceeded with the inquiry and submitted his report to <ORG> finding the appellant guilty of charges to and The appellant thereafter filed an application before <ORG> for amendment of the writ petition The prayer in this amended petition was for the issue of a writ of prohibition restraining the first respondent <ORG> from proceeding further in pursuance of the Show Cause Notice and also for quashing the same The main contention of the appellant was that the proceedings initiated against him were entirely without jurisdiction as no disciplinary proceedings could be taken against him for acts and omissions with regard to his work as Commissioner under the Madras <ORG> Act Madras Act XIX of hereinafter called the Act and that the orders made by him being of quasi judicial character can be impugned only in appropriate proceedings taken under that Act After hearing the arguments advanced on both sides <ORG> rejected the objections raised by the appellant regarding want of jurisdiction and held that the respondents had power to proceed with the inquiry into the charges <NAME> on the other hand took the view that quasi judicial decisions became final and conclusive if they were not set aside or modified in the manner prescribed by the statute and if the decisions are not so challenged their correctness or legality must be taken to be conclusive and such quasi judicial decisions cannot form the subject matter of charges in disciplinary proceedings against the appellant <NAME> held that <ORG> had therefore no jurisdiction to proceed with the inquiry on the first part of charge charge the first part of charge and charge but <ORG> had jurisdiction to proceed with the inquiry with regard to the second part of charge No the second part of charge No and charge No In view of this difference of opinion the matter was placed before <NAME> who agreed with the view taken by <ORG> and in the result the writ petition of the appellant was dismissed It is necessary at this stage to set out the charges leveled against the appellant The total area covered by all the leases comes to over acres In many cases of the leases aforesaid and otherwise generally in regard to the control and supervision exercised by you over the administration of endowments your conduct has been such as to render you unfit for the performance of your statutory duties under the Madras Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act or as a responsible Officer of the Government That you sanctioned the lease of extensive forest lands with valuable tree growth belonging to various Devaswoms to your relations neighbours and friends contrary to the provision in Rule of the All India Services Conduct Rules which enjoins every member of the service to maintain absolute integrity in all official matters Section of the Act provides that the administration of all religious endowments shall be subject to the general superintendence and control of the Commissioner and that such superintendence and control shall include the power to pass any orders which may be deemed necessary for the proper administration of the endowments Section of the Act states that any sale exchange or mortgage and any lease for a term exceeding five years of any immovable property belonging to any religious institution shall be null and void unless it is sanctioned by the Commissioner as being necessary or beneficial to the institution and the Commissioner shall before according sanction publish particulars of the proposed transaction invite objections and consider them Sub section provides for communicating a copy of the order granting sanction to the <ORG> and to the trustee Sub section provides for an appeal against the order of the Commissioner to the <ORG> by the trustee or any person having interest The Government may call for and examine the record of the Commissioner or any Deputy or Assistant Commissioner of any Area Committee or of any trustee in respect of any proceeding not being a proceeding in respect of which a suit or an appeal to a Court is provided by this Act to satisfy themselves as to the regularity of such proceeding or the correctness legality or propriety of any decision or order passed therein and if in any case it appears to the Government that any such decision or order should be modified annulled reversed or remitted for reconsideration they may pass orders accordingly Provided that the Government shall not pass any order prejudicial to any party unless he has had a reasonable opportunity of making his representations It is well settled that the writ of prohibition lies not only for excess of jurisdiction or for absence of jurisdiction but the writ also lies in a case of departure from the rules of natural justice See Halsbury Laws of England rd Edn It was held for instance by <ORG> in <NAME> that as the order of the judge of the consistory court of July was made without giving the vicar an opportunity of being heard in his defence the order was made in violation of the principles of natural justice and was therefore an order made without jurisdiction and the writ of prohibition ought to issue But the writ does not lie to correct the course practice or procedure of an inferior tribunal or a wrong decision on the merits of the proceedings It is also well established that a writ of prohibition cannot be issued to a court or an inferior tribunal for an error of law unless the error makes it go outside its If there is want of jurisdiction then the matter is coram non Judice and a writ of prohibition will lie to the court or inferior tribunal forbidding it to continue proceedings therein in excess of its jurisdiction The first proposition put forward by the appellant is that the Commissioner is a corporation sole and not a servant of the Government and against a person acting in the capacity of a Commissioner the Government have no jurisdiction to take disciplinary proceedings Authority to institute proceedings and to impose penalty Where a member of the Service has committed any act or omission which renders him liable to any penalty specified in rule a if such act or omission was committed before his appointment to the service the Government under whom be is for the time being serving shall alone be competent to institute disciplinary proceedings against him and subject to the provisions of sub rule to impose on him such penalty specified in rule as it thinks fit if such act or omission was committed after his appointment to the Service the Government under whom such member was serving at the time of the commission of such act or omission shall alone be competent to institute disciplinary proceedings against him and subject to the provisions of sub rule to impose on him such penalty specified in rule as it thinks fit and the Government under whom he is serving at the time of the institution of such proceedings shall be bound to render all reasonable facilities to the Government instituting and conducting such proceedings The penalty of dismissal removal or compulsory retirement shall not be imposed on a member of the Service except by an order of <ORG> It is not disputed that the appropriate <ORG> has power to take disciplinary proceedings against the appellant and that he could be removed from service by an order of <ORG> but it was contended that I A Officers are governed by statutory rules that any act or omission referred to in rule relates only to an act or omission of an officer when serving under the <ORG> and that serving under the <ORG> means subject to the administrative control of the <ORG> and that disciplinary proceedings should be therefore on the basis of the relationship of master and servant It was argued that in exercising statutory powers the Commissioner was not subject to the administrative control of the <ORG> and disciplinary proceedings cannot therefore be instituted against the appellant in respect of an act or omission committed by him in the course of his employment as Commissioner We are unable to accept the proposition contended for by the appellant as correct It does not say that the act or omission must have been committed in the discharge of his duty or in the course of his employment as a <ORG> servant It is not disputed that the appellant was at the time of the alleged misconduct employed as the First Member of <ORG> and he was at the same time performing the duties of Commissioner under the Act in addition to his duties as the First Member of <ORG> In other words if the act or omission is such as to reflect on the reputation of the officer for his integrity or good faith or devotion to duty there is no reason why disciplinary proceedings should not be taken against him for that act or omission even though the act or omission relates to an activity in regard to which there is no actual master and servant relationship To put it differently the test is not whether the act or omission was committed by the appellant in the course of the discharge of his duties as servant of the <ORG> The test is whether the act or omission has some reasonable connection with the nature and condition of his service or whether the act or omission has cast any reflection upon the reputation of the member of the <ORG> for In this context reference may be made to the following observations of <NAME> in <NAME> Foster If a servant conducts himself in a way inconsistent with the faithful discharge of hip duty in the service it is misconduct which justifies immediate dismissal It was also contended by the appellant in this connection that as the Commissioner was made a <ORG> sole under of the Act as a separate and independent personality he was not subject to the control of the Government and no disciplinary proceedings Could be initiated against him We do not think there is any substance in this argument Section of the Act provides for the establishment of a Fund called <ORG> and further states that the Fund shall vest in the Commissioner It was argued for the appellant that the corporate entity created by of the Act has a separate legal personality But there is a juristic distinction between a <ORG> sole and a <ORG> aggregate and the <ORG> sole is not endowed with a separate legal personality as the <ORG> aggregate And then we are also told that in all probability a corporation sole Cannot enter into a contract except with statutory authority or as incidental to an interest in land Be that as it may the ecclesiastical corporation sole is no juristic person he or it is either natural man or juristic abortion We accordingly reject the contention of the appellant that the Commissioner has a separate legal personality as corporation sole under of the Act and that he is exempt from disciplinary proceedings for any act or omission committed in his capacity as We next proceed to examine the contention of the appellant that the Commissioner was exercising a quasi judicial function in sanctioning the leases under the Act and his orders cannot therefore be questioned except in accordance with the provisions of the Act It was argued that an appeal is provided under of the Act against the order of the Commissioner granting It was said that so long as these methods were not adopted the Government could not institute disciplinary proceedings and re examine the legality of the order of the Commissioner granting sanction to the leases The first part of charge No was that the appellant in utter disregard of the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder passed orders sanctioning the leases in the cases mentioned in the statement of allegations Under section of the Madras Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act of any exchange sale or mortgage and any lease for a term exceeding years of any immovable property belonging to or given or endowed for the purpose of any religious institution shall be null and void unless it is sanctioned by the Commissioner as being necessary or beneficial to the institution Under the proviso to the section the particulars of the proposed transactions shall be published at least in one daily newspaper inviting objections and suggestions with respect By the rules made under section clauses and of the Act notice of the proposals for a lease for a period exceeding five years of immovable property belonging to a religious institution shall contain particulars of the nature of the proposed transaction the correct description of the properties and information regarding the survey number extent and boundaries the probable price or the rental as the case may be The rules made under section of the Act provide that all leases of lands buildings sites or other immovable properties and rights belonging to a religious institution shall be made by public auction It follows from the above that the proposals for leasing out the <ORG> lands have to be initiated by the Trustee or the Fit Person and that such leases have ordinarily to be granted only by auction in exceptional cases lands may be leased out by the trustee without auction subject to the previous sanction of the Deputy Commissioner After the Commissioner accords sanction further steps for leasing out the lands have to be taken by the trustee who is the lessor and the proposed lessee On behalf of the respondents it was argued both by Mr <NAME> and Mr <NAME> that the Commissioner was not discharging quasi judicial functions in sanctioning leases under of the Act but we shall proceed on the assumption that the Commissioner was performing quasi judicial functions in granting leases under of the Act Even upon that assumption we are satisfied that the Government was entitled to institute disciplinary proceedings if there was prima facie material for showing recklessness or misconduct on the part of the appellant in the discharge of his official duty It is true that if the provisions of of the Act or the Rules are disregarded the order of the Commissioner is illegal and such an order could be questioned in appeal under or in revision under of the Act It is the manner in which he discharged his functions that is brought up in these proceedings In other words the charge and the allegations are to the effect that in exercising his powers as Commissioner the appellant acted in abuse of his power and it was in regard to such misconduct that he is being proceeded against It is manifest therefore that though the propriety and legality of the sanction to the leases may be questioned in appeal or revision under the Act the Government is not precluded from taking disciplinary action if there is proof that the Commissioner had acted in gross recklessness in the discharge of his duties or that he failed to act honestly or in good faith or that he omitted to observe the prescribed conditions which are essential for the exercise of the statutory power We see no reason why the Government cannot do so for the purpose of showing that the Commissioner acted in utter disregard of the conditions prescribed for the exercise of his power or that he was guilty of misconduct or gross negligence It was argued that the rule regarding auction did not apply to long term leases falling within the scope of of the Act and the first part of charge No was therefore not sustainable Rule of the Rules framed under of the Act reads as follows All leases of lands buildings sites and other immovable properties and rights belonging to a religious institution shall be made by public auction held in the places in which the properties are situate or the rights exist It was argued on behalf of the respondents that all leases had to be made by public auction and the Commissioner had no authority to sanction any leases without auction and that the power to waive the public auction is given to the Deputy Commissioner and not to the Commissioner under rule In this connection reference was made by the appellant to rule which provides that auction is to be conducted in the case of a lease for a period of one year or more within one month and in the case of a lease for a period of less than one year within days after the date of the trustee decision regarding the period for which the lease should be given It was said that it would be impossible to conduct an auction in such a case within one month of the date of the trustee decision because a minimum period of days is prescribed between the notice and hearing of objections under It was said that some more time will necessarily have to be allowed for the trustees to send an application after they decide the period of the lease and for the Commissioner to issue the notice himself and to communicate his sanction to the trustees We do not think there is any substance in this argument because it is open to the trustee to hold the auction in the first place under Rule even in the case of a lease for a period over years and then send the proposal to the Commissioner for sanction In other words Rule requiring public auction framed under covers all leases and there is no exception in respect of leases exceeding years falling within the scope of of the Act We accordingly reject the argument of the appellant on this aspect of the case As regards the second part of charge No it was argued by the appellant that there was no prohibition in the Act for the Commissioner to himself initiate the proposal for leases and therefore the charge cannot be sustained The question for consideration is whether the Commissioner could initiate a proposal for lease in favour of a specified individual with all the terms and conditions It is not disputed by the appellant that the trustee is the proper person to initiate a proposal for lease of the trust properties but it is argued that under of the Act the Commissioner can make specific proposals for leases and that he an himself sanction them under the power to pass an order which may be necessary to ensure that such endowments are properly administered and their income is really appropriated for the purpose for which they were founded Under of he Act the Commissioner is given a specific power to accord sanction in for any alienation and for leases for a term exceeding years If the language of is understood as suggesting that the Commissioner has power to initiate proposals it would mean that the Commissioner himself may sit in judgment over the proposals initiated by him It is true that the Sup Cl legislature has put a restriction on the power of alienation and the power of granting leases by of the Act but the statutory restriction on the power of the trustee should not be interpreted in such a way as to abrogate all his power in respect of alienation or As regards charges and it is not shown on behalf of the appellant that there is any defect of jurisdiction and that the respondents cannot proceed with the inquiry appellant that there was no formal order of the Government for instituting these proceedings In that case the order of suspens on was challenged by the appel lant by a writ petition in No of which was dismissed by <NAME> Against that decision the appellant preferred an appeal which was dismissed by the Division Bench It was contended by the appellant that the only issue considered in that case was whether the appellant could be suspended before the charges were framed and the rule of res judicata was not applicable We shall assume in favour of the appellant that the question is not barred by res judicata Even so we are of the opinion that to there is no substance in the contention of the appellant that there was no valid institution of the disciplinary proceedings under rule would itself indicate that disciplinary proceedings had been initiated against the appellant observation that this case if it has served little else has served to expose a disquieting state of affairs regarding the disposal of valuable forest lands belonging to a religious institution known as <ORG> of which I trust due notice will be taken by the competent authority in the interests of the public administration and the preservation of our forest wealth no less than in the interests of this particular institution The judgment in the above case and the preliminary report of the <ORG> police have disclosed the following grave charges of serious irregularity and official misconduct on the part of the accused or The detailed enquiry into the charges by the <ORG> is in progress The evidence in the case has to be collected from a large number of officers who are subordinate to the accused officer in his capacity as First Member of <ORG> In the interest of the proper conduct of the enquiry it is necessary that the officer should not be allowed to continue in that post In our opinion there is no formal order necessary to initiate disciplinary proceedings under Rule of the Rules and the order of the State <ORG> under Ex Suspension during disciplinary proceedings If having regard to the nature of the charges and the circumstances in any case the Government which initiates any disciplinary proceeding is satisfied that it is necessary or desirable to place under suspension the member of the Service against whom such proceedings are started that Government may a if the member of the Service is serving under it pass an order placing him under suspension or It was pointed out that definite charges were framed on June and the Government had not authority to suspend the appellant before the date of framing charges The grounds oil which it is proposed to take action shall be reduced to the form of a definite charge or charges which shall be communicated to the member of the Service charged together with a statement of the allegations on which each charge is based and of any other circumstances which it is proposed to take into consideration in passing orders on the case It was argued by the appellant that the word charges which occurs in Rule and Rule should be given the same meaning and no order of suspension could be passed under Rule before the charges are framed under Rule against the appellant We do not think there is any substance in this argument Rule prescribes that the grounds on which it is proposed to take action shall be reduced to the form of a definite charge or charges In view of he difference of language in Rule and Rule we are of the pinion that the word charges in rule should be given a wider meaning as denoting the accusations or imputations against the member of the <ORG> We accordingly reject the argument of the appellant on this aspect of the case For the reasons already expressed we hold that the appellant has made out no case for the grant of a writ of prohibition under Art In the circumstances of the case we do not make any order as to costs
