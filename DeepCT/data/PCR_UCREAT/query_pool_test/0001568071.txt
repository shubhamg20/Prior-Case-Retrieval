In either case the th defendant and her co tenants could have taken only as tenants in common and not as joint tenants defendants and are sons the rd defendant the daughter and the fourth defendant the widow of the original under lessee and while on the one hand there is no averment that they constituted a joint family and took the property as such on the other there is nothing in the gift deed Ext to show that a joint tenancy was intended to be created thereby and in the absence of notice to quit to the th defendant there was no effective determination of the lease AIR SC in paragraph of the report that notice to one alone of several Joint tenants is sufficient applies only to a case where the several tenants hold as joint tenants and not where as in this case they hold as tenants in common That is cleat from the emphasis placed by their Lordships on the circumstance that the tenants took the premises as joint tenants the deed of assignment by which they acquired the lease expressly providing that they were taking as joint tenants Where joint owners are joint tenants there is unity of title unity of interest and the right of survivorship in addition to unity of possession so that it might be said that any one of the joint tenants represents the entire estate indeed in the <ORG> case already referred to it would appear that one of the two joint tenants had died and the lease had vested solely in the other by suivorship before notice to quit was served on the other so that there was no question of the legal representatives of the deceased joint tenant having any interest whatsoever in the lease so as to require that notice should go to them Where however the joint owners are only tenants in common there is only unity of possession not of title or interest and to determine a tenancy so held in accordance with section of the Transfer of Property Act notice must be addressed to all the tenants though proof of service on one will be prima facie proof of service on all In the words of the section notice must go to every party intended to be bound by it and if it is not issued to any of the joint owners of the lease there is no determination of the lease so far as he is concerned A lease cannot be determined piecemeal and hence it follows that there is no determination even so far as the others are concerned I dismiss this appeal with costs
