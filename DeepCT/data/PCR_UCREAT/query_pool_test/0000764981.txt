This reference to a Full Bench has been made for a decision on the correctness of the <ORG> ruling in <ORG> <NAME> KLT The respondents claimants contend on the basis of the ruling in <NAME> case KLT that notwithstanding the existence of any reservation clause in the policy it is not permissible for the insurer to either contend that there is no negligence on the part of the insured or that the quantum of compensation awarded against the insured is excessive even when the quantum is within the statutory limits in Section It further says that it is only in the limited class of cases where Section A applies that the insurer can raise defences other than those stated in Section Section A permits the insurer to take all defences when it is impleaded suo motu by the <ORG> upon being satisfied that there is collusion between the claimants and the insured or where the insured is ex parte The question is whether Section and Section A are exhaustive and whether the insurer can when there is a reservation clause raise all pleas available to the insured including pleas of want of negligence of the insured or that the award is excessive The contention on behaif of the insurer by learned counsel <NAME> is that Section and Section deal with cancellation or avoidance of a contract of insurance He submits that when an insurer accepts the policy but denies liability under the policy on the basis of a reservation clause in the policy Section and cannot come in the way It is also argued that Section A is only an enabling provision and that if there is a reservation clause in the policy the insurer can take all defences open to the insured against the claimants even if there is no collusion between the insured and the claimants and even if the insured is not ex parte as stated in Section A It is argued therefore that the insured could in view of the reservation clause contend that there is no negligence on the part of the insured or his servants or that the quantum of compensation is on the high side even though it is within the upper limit mentioned in Section On the other hand it is contended for the claimants by Sri <NAME> Sri <NAME> Sri <NAME> and others that Section bars the insurer from raising the above contentions Reliance is also placed on Section Section and Section to say that the insurer is bound to pay the entire award amount and is then to recover excess from the insured It is also pointed out that in some of these cases before us extra premium is paid by the insured to make the insurer liable for an unlimited sum and therefore the appeals have to be dismissed without going into any question of negligence or correctness of the quantum of compensation On the basis of the above contentions the following points arise for consideration Whether in a case where the insurance policy contains a reservation clause the insurer can raise defences other than those mentioned in Section in its own name Whether in a case where the insurance policy contains a reservation clause the insurer can raise all defences even though the case is not one falling under Section A where there is collusion between the insured and the claimants or one where the insured has remained ex parte Whether in view of Section and the third party claimants could recover the total compensation amount from the insured leaving it to the insurer to recover any excess from the insured Whether in a case where on account of extra premium paid by the insured to the insurer so as to make the insurer liability unlimited and not confined to the limits in Section the third party could claim the benefit of the unlimited liability as against the insurer directly under Section read with Section and Section Point No The clause which is relied upon by the appellant insurer is condition of the policy of the insurance and reads as follows No admission offer promise payment or indemnity shall be made or given by or on behalf of the insured without the written consent of the company which shall be entitled if it so desires to take over and conduct in the name of the insured the defence or settlement of any claim or to prosecute in the name of the insured for its own benefit any claim for indemnity or damages or otherwise and shall have full discretion in the conduct of any proceedings or in the settlement of any claim and the insured shall give all such information and assistance as the company may require As Section is the only provision which creates a direct right to the claimants against the insurer and is referred to in Section it is also necessary to refer to the said sub clause If after a certificate of insurance has been issued under Sub section of Section in favour of the person by whom a policy has been effected judgment in respect of any such liability as is required to be covered by a policy under Clause of Sub section of Section being a liability covered by the terms of the policy is obtained against any person insured by the policy then nolwithstanding that the insurer may be entitled to avoid or cancel or may have avoided or cancelled the policy the insurer shall subject to the provisions of this section pay to the person entitled to the benefit of the decree any sum not exceeding the sum assured payable thereunder as if he were the judgment debtor in respect of the liability together with any amount payable in respect of costs and any sum payable in respect of interest on that sum by virtue of any enactment relating to interest on judgments The above provision in Section thus directly creates a right in favour of the claimants against the insurer to recover the amount of such liability as is required to be covered by a policy under Section We have held in another Full Bench case in A No We shall now refer to Section and No sum shall be payable by an insurer under Sub section in respect of any judgment unless before or after the commencement of the proceedings in which the judgment is given the insurer had notice through the court of the bringing of the proceedings or in respect of any judgment so long as execution is stayed thereon pending an appeal and an insurer to whom notice of the bringing of any such proceeding is so given shall be entitled to be made a party thereto and to defend the action on any of the following grounds namely a that the policy was cancelled by mutual consent or by virtue of any provision contained therein before the accident and that either the certificate of insurance was surrendered to the insurer or that either before or not later than fourteen days after the happening of the accident the insurer has commenced proceedings for cancellation that the policy is void on the ground that it was obtained by the non disclosure of a material fact or by a representation of fact which was false in some material particular Section which limits the defences for avoidance of the policy to the defences mentioned in Section reads as follows No insurer to whom the notice referred to in Sub section has been given shall be entitled to avoid his liability to any person entitled to the benefit of any such judgment as is referred to in Sub section otherwise than in the manner provided for in Sub section Before we go into the above aspect we shall point out that such a clause which is called an excess clause is a well known clause in the law of insurance The insured contended that the insurer had no right to settle the matter with the claimants without notice to him the insured and also that the settlement was not bona fide We shall refer to the relevant clauses in that policy shall be entitled if it so desires to take over and conduct in the name of the insured the defence or settlement of any claim or to prosecute in the name of the insured for its own benefit any claim for indemnity or damages or otherwise and shall have full discretion in the conduct of any proceedings or in the settlement of any claim and the insured shall give all such information and assistance as the company may require Another condition stated that the insured was liable to pay the first or any less amount for which the claim may be settled of each claim arising under this policy It was held by <ORG> that the insurer was entitled to settle the claim with the claimant and that the settlement was bona fide and the insured had no right to be consulted before settlement <NAME> observed at Once it is conceded or once it is found that the insurance company have the power to settle the claim then the event which is contemplated in this provision has arisen That seems to me to conclude the matter The provisions of Section and fell for consideration in two decisions of <ORG> In British India Genera The passage reads thus at page of Comp Cas The statute Motor Vehicles Act has no doubt created a liability in the insurer to the injured person but the statute has also expressly confined the right to avoid that liability to certain grounds specified in it It is not for us to add to those grounds and therefore to the statute for reasons of hardship We are furthermore not convinced that the statute causes any hardship First the insurer has the right provided he has reserved it by the policy to defend the action in the name of the assured and if he does so all defences open to the assured can then be urged by him The above decision is a clear authority that it is open to the insurer to reserve a right in the policy of insurance to defend the action in the name of the assured and in case there is such a reservation all defences open to the assured can be urged by him There the contention for the claimants was that the insurance company cannot file an appeal for restricting its liability to the pecuniary limits mentioned in Section of the Act The contention was that the same was not one of the defences mentioned in Section of the Act <ORG> rejected the said contention and held that Section which restricted the insurer to a limited number of defences applied only if the insurance policy was to be either cancelled as in Section a or if it was to be totally avoided on the ground of misrepresentation or suppression of material facts as in Section or where as in Section the insured had committed a breach of certain specified conditions of the policy thereby giving a right to the insurer to avoid the policy It was held by their Lordships that when an insurer wanted to file an appeal contending that it could not be made liable for anything beyond the liability required to be covered under Section such a plea could not be described as a plea to avoid the policy itself in toto within Section The view we have taken following <NAME> case Comp Cas Ins That leads us to the question as to what the rights of the insurer are in the case of assignment by the insured in favour of the insurer in respect of the former rights against third parties For the purpose of deciding this question it is necessary to refer to the general law relating to insurance Under that law a distinction has been made between the cases where the insurer obtains assignment from the insured and cases where the insurer becomes subrogated to the rights of the insured by way of paying the amount due to the insured It is settled in the law of insurance that the insurer can avail of all the defences and grounds or remedies which the insured then has against third parties The only difference is that in the case of assignment the insurer can take action in his own name while in the case of subrogation the insurer has to take action only in the name of the insured In <ORG> th edition volume paragraphs to it is stated that the doctrine of subrogation applies to all contracts of non marine insurance which are contracts of indemnity sych as fire insurance motor insurance and contingency insurance It is further stated that in the strict sense of the term subrogation expresses the right of the insurers to be placed in the place of the assured so as to be entitled to the advantage of all rights and remedies which the assured possesses against third parties and that the most obvious case of subrogation arises in the law of torts It is further stated that if an owner of a vehicle incurs third party liability consequent to negligence of the owner servants then the insurer who discharges the liability of the insured gets subrogated to the rights of the insured against third parties <NAME> <ORG> AC HL AC PC the insurers cannot sue the third parties in their own name Rep and therefore unless there has been an express assignment of the legal right actions at law brought for the benefit of the insurer are brought in the name of the assured <ORG> <NAME> Doug KB Wealkans <ORG>Ont A <ORG> <NAME> MC In Courts of Equity or of Admiralty the insurer has always been allowed to sue in his own name St AC PC above referred to in fact decided that when there was assignment by the <ORG> in favour of the insurer in respect of the <ORG> rights against third parties the insurer can sue the third parties in his own name and avail of all the defences and remedies of the <ORG> against the third parties The above principle laid down in English law has been accepted by various <ORG> in India It was further held in <NAME> case AIR Mad that such an assignment by the insured in favour of the insurer in respect of the rights covered by the motor insurance policy was not hit by Section of the Transfer of Property Act and that the assignment was valid as a transfer of a chose in action as defined in Section of the Transfer of Property Act In the other cases the Madras and Calcutta <ORG> also held that Section of the Transfer of Property Act was not attracted to cases of assignment of rights by an assured in favour of the insurer In the light of the above principles of law it is therefore clear that the insurance company has a right to defend or take action against the third party in its own name on the basis of the assignment by the insured in favour of the insurer in respect of the former rights against third parties We have already referred to the said clause but we shall again refer to the relevant portion thereof It reads No admission offer promise payment or indemnity shall be made or given by or on behalf of the insured without the written consent of the company which shall be entitled if it so desires to take over and conduct in the name of the insured the defence or settlement of any claim We have already noticed that in the case of assignment of rights by the insured in favour of the insurer the insurer has a right to conduct the proceedings in its own name Therefore we have to understand the relevant words in the above said reservation clause in the light of the said principle But this does not mean that the insurer is precluded from defending or prosecuting the proceedings in his own name and there are no words in the reservation clause which take away such a right in favour of the insurer which is available under the general law of insurance For the aforesaid reasons we hold that the appellant insurance company can take advantage of the reservation clause which is in the nature of assignment by the insured of his rights against the third party and the insurer can defend any action filed by the third party by conducting the same in its own name insurer In such a case the insurer can raise all defences which the insured could have raised and obviously the insurer is not confined to the limited defences mentioned in Section of the Motor Vehicles Act Therefore when there is a reservation or assignment clause as stated above the insurer can even take a defence that there is no negligence on the part of the insured or that the quantum of compensation awarded to the third party is excessive even when the said quantum is below the pecuniary limit mentioned in Section of the Motor Vehicles Act Point No It is the contention of the respondents claimants that Section A of the Motor Vehicles Act introduced by the Central Act of with effect from March leads to the inference that the insurer can raise all defences open to the insured against the third party only in a case where the <ORG> has chosen to implead the insurer upon being satisfied that there is collusion between the insured and the third parly or where the insured has remained ex parte The contention is that if the said situations are not in existence the insurer cannot raise any defences other than those specified in Section It reads A Where in the course of any inquiry <ORG> is satisfied that i there is collusion between the person making the claim and the person against whom the claim is made or ii the person against whom the claim is made has failed to contest the claim it may for reasons to be recorded by it in writing direct that the insurer who may be liable in respect of such claim shall be impleaded as a party to the proceeding and the insurer so impleaded shall thereupon have the right to contest the claim on all or any of the grounds that are available to the person against whom the claim has been made We have already held on point No that in view of the reservation or assignment clause the insurer is vested with all the defences or grounds of the insured against the third party and can take action in his own name Even otherwise Section A which deals with the procedure before the <ORG> can only be treated as an enabling provision In our view it does not exhaust all the situations in which the insurer can raise defences open to the insured against the third party The provisions of Section A may however govern a case where there is no reservation clause or assignment of the rights of the insured in favour of the insurer but otherwise it cannot help the respondents We hold therefore that even if there is no collusion between the insured and the third party or even if the insured has not remained ex parte the insurer can raise all defences open to the insured against the third party provided there is a reservation or assignment clause by the insured in favour of the insurer We shall refer to the said provision Where a certificate of insurance has been issued under Sub section of Section to the person by whom a policy has been effected so much of the policy as purports to restrict the insurance of the persons insured thereby by reference to any conditions other than those in Clause of Sub section shall as respects such liabilities as are required to be covered by a policy under Clause of Sub section of Section be of no effect Provided that any sum paid by the insurer in or towards the discharge of any liability of any person which is covered by the policy by virtue only of this sub section shall be recoverable by the insurer from that person Section states that if there is any restriction in the insurance policy which purports to restrict the insurance of the persons insured because of incorporation of any conditions other than those in Section then such conditions will be of no effect for the purpose of making the insurer discharge its liabilities as are required to be covered by a policy under Section Under Section the insurer can avoid the policy for breach by the insured of i a condition that the insured should not use the vehicle a for hire or reward where the vehicle is on the date of the contract of insurance a vehicle not covered by a permit to ply for hire or reward or for organised racing or speed testing or for a purpose not allowed by the permit under which the vehicle is used where the vehicle is a transport vehicle or without side car being attached where the vehicle is a motor cycle ii a condition excluding driving by a named person or unlicensed drivers etc iii a condition excluding liability for injury caused or contributed to by conditions of war civil war riot or civil commotion If the insurer takes out a defence under the law of torts that the insured has not been negligent or if the insurer contends that the quantum of compensation awarded is high though it is within Section limits then such defences are permissible in view of the reservation clause and in view of our decision on Point No and it cannot be said that the insurer is raising defences not covered by Section nor that the said defences are of no effect The raising of the above defences by the insurer in the written statement or in the appeal as permitted by the reservation clause does not in our view amount to imposing conditions other than the permissible conditions specified in Section so as to become ineffective by reason of Section The further contention based on the proviso to Section that the insurance company must first pay the compensation in full cannot also be accepted inasmuch as raising defences in the written statement or in the appeal on the basis of the reservation clause cannot be treated as imposing extra conditions outside Section which are ineffective If the amount which an insurer becomes liable under this Section to pay in respect of a liability incurred by a person insured by a policy exceeds the amount for which the insurer would apart from the provisions of this section be liable under the policy in respect of that liability the insurer shall be entitled to recover the excess from that person The provisions of Section fell for consideration in A No In that case the insurer filed an appeal contending that the <ORG> was wrong in making it liable for the entire amount payable by the insured but that its liability should have been limited to the figure specified in Section It was contended for the claimants that in view of Section the insurer should pay the entire amount and recover the difference from the insured We rejected the said contention in that case We referred to the relevant rulings of <ORG> in <ORG> A Ranasinghe AC PC the majority decision of <ORG> <NAME> <ORG> Lloyd Rep and to the judgment of <ORG> in the appeal from that case viz We held that the words the amount which an insurer becomes liable under the section in Section meant the liability to the third party covered by Section namely the statutory liability under Section as further limited by the pecuniary limits in Section It was held that Section only meant that in a case where the insurer avoided the policy on grounds stated in Section the insurer could then recover from the insured under Section the compensation paid by the insurer to the third party in its entirety Again in a case where the policy was not avoided but the insurer paid the actual amount mentioned in Section and interest and costs to the third party Section could mean that the insurer could recover from the insured if he wanted to do so the interest and costs that being the sum not payable if Section did not apply We held that the basic principle was that the right of the third party against the insurer was limited always to the liability covered by Section and Section in view of Section In other words it is more than the statutory limits prescribed in Section But the point is whether the third party claimant could seek the benefit of the extra premium and claim for the entire award amount over and above the statutory limits specified in Section from the insurer In abstract principle in view of Section it must be held that the third party cannot have a remedy against the insurer for anything above the limits specified in Section which means the amount as is required to be covered by Section Section in its turn refers to Section Section of that Act corresponds to Section of our Act while Section corresponds to Section of our Act If after a certificate of insurance has been delivered under Sub section of Section to the persons by whom a policy has been effected judgment in respect of any such liability as is required to be covered by a policy under paragraph of Sub section of Section being a liability covered by the terms of the policy respect of a liability of a person insured by a policy exceeds the amount for which he would apart from the provisions of this section be liable under the policy in respect of that liability he shall be entitled to recover the excess from that person In that case the respondent was injured by the negligent driving of Mr <NAME> The respondent claimed damages for personal injuries against Mr <NAME> for and costs by consent The respondent claimant wanted that the entire sum be paid by the insurer appellant even though by virtue of the provisions of the Act of the statutory liability was restricted to The proviso to Section corresponds to Section limiting the liability of the insurance company to and to other amounts in various situations Again Section of the Act corresponds to Section while Section corresponds to Section Their Lordships followed the decision in <NAME> case Lloyd Rep HL and <ORG> case AC PC The contention that <ORG> case Lloyd Rep PC was wrongly decided and that the view of Lord <NAME> in <ORG> in <NAME> case Lloyd Rep was correct was rejected A further point was also argued that in <NAME> case Lloyd Rep the policy there covered while the statutory liability of the insurance company was only and the award is for and that <NAME> case Lloyd Rep PC was distinguishable That reasoning indicates that so far as the Act is concerned the words in Section such liability as is required to be covered by a policy under paragraph of Sub section of Section It is in their Lordship opinion nothing to the point so far as the construction of Section is concerned that the insurers might under the terms of the policy be bound to indemnify the insured in respect of any excess over the statutory minimum for which an injured third party might have obtained judgment against the insured The effect of Section is to limit the amount which the injured third party can recover directly from the insurers Therefore going strictly by the legal principles above stated the third party cannot by resorting to Section seek to recover from the insurer any amount over and above the statutory limits specified in Section even though as between the insurer and the insured the limit of liability of the insured is unlimited But in practice in our country the nationalised insurance companies have been paying directly to the third party the amount up to the limit covered by the extra premium even though the limit under Section may be less We hold that the insurer is entitled where there is a reservation clause to raise all defences open to the insured against the third party in the proceedings initiated by the third party If there was liability in excess of the limits in Section because of extra premium the third party could be allowed to proceed against the insurer for the amount in excess of the limits in Section We answer the reference accordingly
