CITATOR INFO RF SC SC SC SC SC SC RF SC SC RF SC SC SC SC RF SC SC SC SC SC SC ACT Sales Tax Tanned hides and skin imported from outside and sold inside the State Hides and skins tanned and sold inside the State Sales Tax higher on the latter If discriminatory Old rule Substituted by new rule Old rule does not revive when new rules declared invalid Constitution of India Arts The main contention of the petitioners is that the tanned hides and skins imported from outside and sold inside the State are under of the Madras General Sales Tax Rules subject to a higher rates of tax than the tax imposed on hides and skins tanned and sold within the State and this discriminatory taxation offended Art a as it is not a tax on the import of goods at the point of entry the impugned rule is not a law made by the State legislature the impugned rule by itself does not impose the tax but fixes the single point at which the tax is imposed by ss and of the Act is to be levied Sales Tax of the kind under consideration cannot be said to be a measure regulating any trade or a compensatory tax levied for the use of trading facilities Sales Tax which has the effect of discriminating between goods of one State and goods of another may affect the free flow of trade and it will then offend against Art and will be valid only if it comes within the terms of Art Article a allows the legislature of a State to impose taxes on goods imported from other States and does not support the contentions that the imposition must be at the point of entry Section of the Madras General Sales Tax Act provides that the rules made thereunder shall have effect as if enacted in the Act and of the Madras General Sales Tax Rules would fall within a law made by <ORG> What that rule provides is a step necessary fur the imposition of tax in view of ss and and therefore the impugned rule is a part of the enactment which imposes the tax The fact that the impugned rule was made in view of ss in order to prescribe the single point in series of sales does not justify its discriminatory character Rule discriminates against the imported hides or skins which had been purchased or tanned outside and therefore it contravenes Art Once an old rule has been substituted by a new rule it ceases to exist and it does not get revived when the new rule is held invalid The tax imposed in the present case has not been imposed by misconstruing the provisions of a valid Act but it has been imposed without jurisdiction by reason of the invalidity of of the Constitution raises the question of the validity of of the Madras General Sales Tax Turnover Assessment Rules hereinafter called the rules He sells hides and skins tanned outside the State of Madras as well as those tanned inside the state The Deputy Commercial Tax Officer Moore Market Division Madras assessed the petitioner to sales tax for the year on a turnover of Rs Sales tax was levied on hides and skins under the provisions of the Madras General Sales Tax Act Act IX of hereinafter called the Act Subject to the provisions of this Act a every dealer shall pay for each year a tax on his total turnover for such year and the tax shall be calculated at the rate of three pies for every rupee in such turnover Section of the Act provides for exemptions and reductions of tax in certain cases Clause vi thereof provides that the sale of hides and skins whether tanned or untanned shall be liable to tax under section sub section only at such single point in the series of sales by successive dealers as may be prescribed Section empowers <ORG> to make rules to carry out the purposes of the Act The new rule whose validity is challenged for the petitioner reads In the case of untanned hides and or skins the tax under section shall be levied from the dealer who is the last purchaser in the State not exempt from taxation under section on the amount for which they are bought by him i In the case of hides or skins which have been tanned outside the <ORG> the tax under section shall be levied from the dealer who in the <ORG> is the first dealer in such hides or skins not exempt from taxation under section on the amount for which they are sold by him ii In the case of tanned hides or skins which have been tanned within the State the tax under section shall be levied from a person who is the first dealer in such hides or skins not exempt from taxation under section on the amount for which they are sold by him Provided that if he proves that the tax has already been levied under sub rule on the untanned hides and skins out of which the tanned hides and skins had been produced he shall not be so liable It is contended for the petitioner that the effect of this rule is that tanned hides or skins imported from outside the <ORG> and sold within the <ORG> are subject to a higher rate of tax than the tax imposed on hides or skins tanned and sold within the <ORG> inasmuch as sales tax on the importer hides or skins tanned outside the <ORG> is on their sale price while the tax on hides or skins tanned within the <ORG> though ostensibly on their sale price is in view of the proviso to cl ii of sub Further for similar reasons hides or skins imported from outside the <ORG> after purchase in their raw condition and then tanned inside the <ORG> are also subject to higher taxation than hides or skins purchased in the raw condition in the <ORG> and tanned within the <ORG> as the tax on the former is on the sale price of the tanned hides or skins and on the latter is on the sale price of the raw hides or skins The impugned rule by itself does not impose the tax but fixes the sin ale point at which the tax imposed by ss and of the Act is to be levied The impugned rule was not made with an eye on the place of origin of the goods but as a matter of necessity in view of the requirements of the statutory provisions to the effect that hides or skins raw or tanned came within one category and that the tax on them could be levied at a single point only The impugned rule therefore fixed that single point with respect to the sale of raw hides or skins at the last purchase by the dealer in the <ORG> and with respect to the sale of tanned hides or skins at the first sale of such tanned hides or skin by the dealer in the <ORG> would be such restrictions as directly and immediately restrict or impede the free flow or movement of trade Taxes may and do amount to restrictions but it is only such taxes as directly and immediately restrict trade that would fall within the purview of Art a rational and workable test to apply would be Does the impugned restriction operate directly or immediately on trade or its movement Our conclusion therefore is that when Art provides that trade shall be free throughout the territory of India it means that the flow of trade shall run smooth and unhampered by any restriction either at the boundaries of the States or at any other points inside the States themselves It is the free movement or the transport of goods from one part of the country to the other that is intended to be saved and if any Act imposes any direct restrictions on the very movement of such goods it attracts the provisions of Art and its validity can be sustained only if it satisfies the requirements of Art In the majority judgment in the Automobile Transport Case it was said at The interpretation which was accepted by the majority in the <ORG> Case is correct but subject to this clarification Regulatory measures or measures imposing Compensatory taxes for the use of trading facilities do not come within the purview of the restrictions contemplated by Art They are excluded from the purview of the provisions of Part XIII of the Constitution for the simple reason that they do not hamper trade commerce and intercourse but rather facilitate them declares a right of free movement of trade without any obstructions by way of barriers inter <ORG> or intrastate or other impediments operating as such barriers The said freedom is not impeded but on the other hand promoted by regulations creating conditions for the free movement of trade such as police regulations provision for services main tenance of roads provision for aerodromes wharfs etc It is therefore now well settled that taxing laws can be restrictions on trade commerce and intercourse if they hamper the flow of trade and if they are not what can be termed to be compensatory taxes or regulatory measures Sales tax which has the effect of discriminating between goods of one <ORG> and goods of another may affect the free flow of trade and it will then offend against Art and will be valid only if it comes within the terms of Art Article a enables <ORG> a <ORG> to make laws affecting trade commerce and intercourse It enables the imposition of taxes on goods from other <ORG>s if similiar goods in the <ORG> are subjected to similiar taxes so as not to discriminate between the goods manufactured or produced in that <ORG> and the goods which are imported from others <ORG>s We do not agree with the contentions for the respondents Section vi provides that the sale of hides or skins whether tanned or untanned shall be liable to tax under only at such single point in the series of sales by successive dealers as may be prescribed Prescribed means Prescribed by rules made under the Act This rule was made by the Governor in the exercise of power confer red on him under of the Act and would therefore have statutory force In fact sub of provides that the rules shall have effect as if enacted in the Act What the rule provides is a step necessary for the imposition of the tax in view of ss and and therefore the impugned rule is a part of the enactment which imposes the tax The fact that the impugned rule was made in order to prescribe the single point in the series of sales by successive dealers at which the tax on sale of hides or skins was to be levied in view of ss and of the Act does not justify the making of such a rule which discriminates between the tax imposed on goods imported from outside the State and the goods produced or manufactured in the State Now the only question that remains for consideration is whether this rule discriminates between hides or skins imported from outside the State and those manufactured or produced in the State Sub rule of the rule deals with the sale of raw hides and skins The tax is levied from the dealer who is the last purchaser in the <ORG> The tax is levied from the dealer who The proviso is to the effect that if the dealer of hides or skins which had been tanned within the <ORG> proves that tax had already been levied on those hide or skins in their raw condition in accordance with sub The result therefore is that the sale of hides or skins which had been purchased in the <ORG> and then tanned within the <ORG> is not subject to any further tax Hides and skins tanned within the <ORG> are mostly those which had been purchased in their raw condition in the <ORG> and therefore on which tax had already been levied on the price paid by the purchaser at the time of their sale in the raw condition If the dealer has purchased the raw hide or skin in the <ORG> he does not pay on the sale price of the tanned hides or skins he pays on the purchase price only If the dealer purchases raw hides or skins from outside the <ORG> and tans them within the <ORG> he will be liable to pay sales tax on the sale price of the tanned hides or skins He too will have to pay more for tax even though the hides and skins are tanned within the <ORG> merely on account of his having imported the hides and skins from outside and having not therefore paid any tax under sub It is true that dealers though few selling hides and skins which had been tanned within the <ORG> will also have to pay similar tax if no tax had been paid previously they having not purchased the raw hides and skins at all as they were from the carcasses of animals owned by them but this does not affect the discriminatory nature of the tax as already indicated It is urged for the respondent <ORG> that to consider discrimination between the imported goods and goods produced or manufactured in the <ORG> circumstances and situations at the taxable point must be similar and that the circumstance of hides or skins tanned within the <ORG> and on which tax had been paid earlier at the time of their purchase in the raw condition is sufficient to consider such hides or skins to be different from the hides or skins which had been tanned outside the <ORG> We do not consider that the mere circumstance of a tax having been paid on the sale of such hides or skins in their raw condition justifies their forming goods of a different kind from the tanned hides or skins which had been imported from outside At the time of sale of those hides or skins in the tanned state there was no difference between them as goods and the hides or skins tanned outside the <ORG> as goods We are therefore of opinion that the privisions of discriminate against the imported hides or skins which had been purchased or tanned outside the <ORG> and that therefore they contravene the provisions of Art It has been urged for the respondent that if the impugned rule be held to be invalid old gets revived and that the tax assessed on the petitioner will be good Once the old rule has been substituted by the new rule it ceases to exist and it does not automatically get revived when the new rule is held to be invalid This is not a case in which the tax has been levied by the Deputy Commercial Tax Officer by misconstruing certain provisions of a valid Act but is a case where the taxing officer had no juris We therefore allow this petition with costs holding the impugned rule invalid and order the issue of a writ of mandamus to the State of Madras and <ORG> under the Act to refrain from enforcing any of the provisions of and direct them to refund the tax illegally collected from the petitioner
