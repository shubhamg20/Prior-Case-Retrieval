Rules made under Art Fundamental Rule embodies pleasure doctrine Compulsory refirement at age of after a certain number of years of service does not have civil consequences Rules of natural justice cannot be invoked in such case Rules of natural justice operate only in areas not covered by law validly made On August the President of India pleased by an order under Rule of the Funda mental Rules to compulsorily retire the first respondent from Government service No reasons were given in the order The appellant challenged the order by a writ petition in <ORG> The failure on the part of the concerned authority to give opportunity to the first respondent to show cause against his compulsory retirement was held by <ORG> to have amounted to a contravention of the principles of natural justice As observed by this Court in <NAME> case these rules can operate only in areas not covered by any law validly made If a statutory provision can be read consistently with the principles of natural justice the <ORG> should do so because it must be presumed that the legislatures and the statutory authorities intend to act in accordance with the principles of natural justice But on the other hand a statutory provision either specifically or by necessary implication excludes the application of any or all the principles of natural justice then the court cannot ignore the mandate of the legislature or the statutory authority and read with the concerned provision the principles of natural justice Whether the exercise of a power conferred should be made in accordance with any of the principles of natural justice or not depends upon the express words of the provision conferring the power the nature of the power conferred the purpose for which it is conferred and the effect of the exercise of the power Fundamental Rule i does not in terms require that any opportunity should be given to the concerned Government servant to show cause against his compulsory requirement It says that the appropriate authority has the absolute right to retire a government servant if it is of the opinion that it is in the public interest to do so If that authority bona fide forms that opinion the correctness of that opinion cannot be challenged before courts though it is open to an aggrieved party to contend that the requisite opinion has not been formed or the decision is based on collateral grounds or that it is an arbitrary decision The respondent had not challenged the impugned order on any of these grounds It merely embodies one of the facets of the pleasure doctrine embodied in Art While a minimum service is guaranteed to the government servant the government is given power to energise its machinery and make it more efficient by compulsorily retiring those who in its opinion should not be there in public interest On the above view of the law namely that no notice to show cause was required the appeal must be allowed Appeal from the judgment and order dated December of <ORG> in Civil Writ No of That order was attacked before <ORG> on various grounds It did not find it necessary to decide a few others but accepting the contention of the respondent that in making the order the appellant had violated the principles of natural justice it held that the impugned order is invalid <ORG> accordingly issued a writ of certiorari quashing that order Hence we shall address ourselves only to that question He worked as probationer for a period of three years and thereafter he was confirmed in that post in In exercise of the powers conferred by the proviso to Art of the Constitution the President of India made on August rules called the Survey of India Recruitment from Corps of Engineering Officers Rules for regulating the recruitment and conditions of service of persons appointed from <ORG> of <ORG> to <ORG> Rule of the said Rules provides for the recruitment of Military Officers to <ORG> and Rule provides that the recruited officers will be on probation for two years which may be extended by the <ORG> on the advice of the Surveyor General The st respondent was taken into <ORG> under Rule of the aforesaid Rules as Deputy Superintendent Surveyor with effect from June Fundamental Rule reads Notwithstanding anything contained in this Rule the appropriate authority shall if it is of the opinion that it is in the public interest so to do have the absolute right to retire any Government servant by giving him notice of not less than three months in writing or three months pay and allowances in lieu of such notice i if he is in Class I or Class II Service or post the age limit for the purpose of direct recruitment to which is below years after he has attained the age of years ii In any other case after he has attained the age of years Provided that nothing in this clause shall apply to a Government servant referred to in clause who entered Government service on or before rd July and to a Government servant referred to in clause The order impugned merely says that in pursuance of cl the President was pleased to decide that in public interest the st respondent should retire from government service with effect from August and that he would be given three months pay and allowances in lieu of three months notice provided in the said rule Admittedly no opportunity was given to him to show cause against his compulsory retirement The failure on the part of the concerned authority to give an opportunity to the st respondent to show cause against his compulsory retirement was held by <ORG> to have amounted to a contravention of the principles of natural justice Fundamental Rule in terms does not require that any opportunity should be given to the concerned government servant to show cause against his compulsory retirement But this Pleasure doctrine is subject to the rules or law made under Art These rules can operate only in areas not covered by any law validly made In other words they do not supplant the law but supplement it is true that if a statutory provision can be read consistently with the principles of natural justice But if on the other hand a statutory provision either specifically or by necessary implication excludes the application of any or all the principles of natural justice then the court cannot ignore the mandate of the legislature or the statutory authority and read into the concerned provision the principles of natural justice Whether the exercise of a power conferred should be made in accordance with any of the principles of natural justice or not depends upon the express words of the provision conferring the power the nature of the power conferred the purpose for which it is conferred and the effect of the exercise of that power Now coming to the express words of Fundamental Rule it says that the appropriate authority has the absolute right to retire a government servant if it is of the opinion that it is in the public interest to do so That power can be exercised subject to the conditions mentioned in the rule If that authority bona fide forms that opinion the correctness of that opinion cannot be challenged before courts It is open to an aggrieved party to contend that the requisite opinion has not been formed or the decision is based on collateral grounds or that it is an arbitrary decision The st respondent challenged the opinion formed by the government on the ground of mala fide The impugned order was not attacked on the ground that the required opinion was not formed or that the opinion formed was an arbitrary one One of the conditions of the st respondent service is that the government can choose to retire him any time after he completes fifty years if it thinks that it is in public interest to do so Various considerations may weigh with the appropriate authority while exercising the power conferred under the rule In some cases the government may feel that a particular post may be more usefully held in public interest by an officer more competent than the one who is holding It may be that the officer who is holding the post is not inefficient but the appropriate authority may prefer to have a more efficient officer There is no denying the fact that in all organizations and more so in government organizations there is good deal of dead wood While a minimum service is guaranteed to the government servant the government is given power to energise its machinery and make it more efficient by compulsorily retiring those who in its opinion should not be there in public interest It cannot be said that if the retiring age of all or a section of the government servants is fixed at years the same would involve civil consequences It is under those circumstances this Court held that the order refixing the date of birth was vitiated for failure to comply with the principles of natural justice In <NAME> case a committee consisting of Chief Conservator of Forest Kashmir and others was appointed to recommend names of the officers from <ORG> for Under those circumstances this Court held that there was contravention of the principles of natural justice We accordingly allow this appeal set aside the judgment and decree of <ORG> and dismiss the writ petition In the circumstances of the case we make no order as to costs The <ORG> by order dated November and January on an application for review filed by the respondent vacated its order dismissing the writ petition Instead the proceedings were remanded to the High <ORG> for decision on such points as were not dealt with and decided in the judgment of that court
