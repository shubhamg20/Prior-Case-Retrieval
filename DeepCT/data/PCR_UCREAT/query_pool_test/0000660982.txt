If <ORG> is not satisfied that the statements contained in the case are sufficient to enable it to determine the questions raised thereby the <ORG> may refer the case back to <ORG> by which it was stated to make such additions thereto or alterations therein as the <ORG> may direst in that behalf <ORG> upon the hearing of any sash case shall decide the questions raised thereby and shall deliver its judgment thereon containing the grounds on which such decision is founded and shall send to <ORG> by which the case was stated a copy of such judgment under the seal of the <ORG> and the signature of the Registrar and <ORG> shall dispose of the case accordingly or if the case arose on reference from any Revenue Officer subordinate to it shall forward a copy of such judgment to such Officer who shall dispose of the case conformably to such judgment Where a reference is made to <ORG> on the application of an assessee costs shall be in the discretion of the <ORG> The assessment which has led up to the present proceeding was made by the Collector of Tipperah in whose jurisdiction the assessee resides within the meaning of the definition of the term Collector contained in Sub section of Section of the Indian income Tax Act The matter was then taken before the Commissioner who heard the objections allowed them in part and modified the order of the Collector on the th December As an Attorney can appear in this <ORG> only on the Original Side and in appeals from the Original Side the question arose whether this was a matter in which Counsel could be instructed by an Attorney or only by a <NAME> Consequently the point which the Advocate General had previously brought to the notice of the <ORG> did require consideration though in a somewhat different form We accordingly heard the Advocate General and Mr <NAME> and held that as this reference by <ORG> arose out of a proceeding for assessment of income tax within the jurisdiction of the Collector of Tipperah and the Commissioner of <ORG> <NAME>s were entitled to be heard and Counsel could be properly instructed only by a <NAME> We shall now state the grounds for our ruling on the question of procedure and then give our decision on the points raised in the Reference It is plain that the nature of the proceeding cannot be affected by coincidental circumstances such as the plane from or the channel through which the Reference has been made it is immaterial whether at the time of the Reference <ORG> was at Calcutta Darjeeling or Dacca or whether <ORG> caused the order of Reference to be transmitted to the Government Solicitor who placed the matter in the hands of the Registrar on the Original Side or to the Legal Remembrance who entrusted the matter to the charge of the Government Pleader on the Appellate Side Under Section the Commissioner may pass such order as he thinks fit by way of confirmation reduction enhancement or cancellation of the assessment Section next authorises <ORG> to call for the record of any assessment proceeding which has been taken by any Officer subordinate to it and to make such enquiry and to pass such orders thereon as it thinks fit Section empowers <ORG> to make a reference to <ORG> either on it own motion that is when it has seizin of the proceeding under Section or on reference from any Revenue Officer subordinate to it that is while the proceeding is still before the Collector or the Commissioner Section further provides that <ORG> shall make such reference on the application of the assessee unless it is satisfied that the application is frivolous or that a reference is unnecessary When such a reference has been made the opinion pronounced by <ORG> cannot be ignored because it is made obligatory on <ORG> concerned to decide the case conformably to the judgment of <ORG> This does not justify the inference that the <ORG> has no power to revise proceedings or to hear references On the other hand a reference is made by a subordinate to a superior <ORG> with a view to obtain its opinion upon a controverter question of law and thereby avoid possible error The essence of the matter thus is that when a <ORG> hears a reference it really performs the functions of a <ORG> of Appeal quite as much as it undoubtedly does when it hears an application for revision The index of the relation of superior and inferior <ORG> is furnished by the fast that the judgment pronounced on the reference by <ORG> is binding upon the referring authority There is thus no escape from the conclusion that <ORG> exercises not an original but an appellate jurisdiction when it entertains a reference under Section of the Indian Income Tax Act In this connection we must not overlook Section of the Government of India Act which provides that <ORG> has not and may not exercise any original jurisdiction in any matter concerning the revenue or concerning any Act ordered or done in the collection thereof according to the usage and practice of the country or the law for the time being in force this substantially reproduces the provision in Section of Geo III which debarred the Supreme <ORG> from exercising jurisdiction in any matter concerning the revenue A distinction may thus legitimately be drawn between a reference made in connection with an assessment on a person who resides in the town of Calcutta that is within the limits of the ordinary original civil jurisdiction of this <ORG> and a reference made in connection with an assessment on a person who resides beyond the limits of the ordinary original civil jurisdiction of his <ORG> In the present case the assessment under Section was made by the Collector of Tipperah and the order under Section which ultimately came under examination by <ORG> was made by the Commissioner of <ORG> Consequently the procedure which governs appeals from the <ORG> in the Provinces within the meaning of Clause of the Letters Patent is applicable to the reference made by <ORG> under Section and on such reference <NAME>s but not Attorneys are entitled to appear there no such question was raised possibly for the reason that as the Company though owning property situated at Naogaon in Assam had its registered office at Clive Street Calcutta and might consequently be deemed under Section to have its principal place of business within the town of Calcutta the assessment was in fact made by the Collector of Income Tax Calcutta that <NAME>s had no right of audience in <ORG> in cases sent up for trial under Act XIV of where the <ORG> was equally divided in opinion upon the question whether <NAME>s were entitled to be heard in a proceeding under Section of the Criminal Procedure Code instituted in a <ORG> Small Cause <ORG> and brought up before <ORG> in the exercise of its revisional jurisdiction or of its power of superintendence Nor is any light thrown on the point before us by the practice in connection with references under Section of the Indian Stamp Act such references so far as we have been able to discover have hitherto been made mostly in connection with matters arising within the limits of the ordinary original civil jurisdiction of this <ORG> and in such cases claim to a right of audience would not ordinarily be put forward by <NAME>s but in one instance at least Reference under Stamp Act where the question arose in relation to <ORG> from the <ORG> Counsel appeared with a <NAME> at the hearing We have next to consider the questions referred by <ORG> to this Court for decision Is selami or premium agricultural income within the meaning of Section of the Indian Income Tax Act when charged Section a lays down that agricultural income means any rent or revenue derived from land which is used for agricultural purposes and is either assessed to land revenue or subject to a local rate assessed and collected by officers of Government as such The assessee contends that the incomes mentioned in the two questions are exempt from assessment as they constitute agricultural income within the meaning of the definition just given It is not necessary to hold that such Salami is rent within the meaning of the definition given in the Bengal Tenancy Act or the Transfer of Property Act There can be little doubt that when a lease is granted the amount fixed for periodical payment is not independent of the amount paid in a lump sum as premium From this point of view we must hold that the premium paid for the settlement of waste lands or abandoned holdings may reasonably be regarded as rent or revenue derived from land within the meaning of that expression as used in the definition of agricultural income in Section a The money is paid by the transferee to the landlord to purchase peace so that he may not contest the validity of the transfer The item uttarayan is a voluntary payment made by tenants at one piece per rupee of their rent for expenses of the Bastu Puja on the Uttarayan Sanskranti day the list day of the Bengali month Pous and for distribution of sweets and oranges to all servants of the estate <ORG> officers and local residents
