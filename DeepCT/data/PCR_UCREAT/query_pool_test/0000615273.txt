for any assessment year he may assess or reassess such income Allowing the appeal HELD The opinion of the internal audit organization of the <ORG> on a point of law cannot be regarded as information within the meaning of of the Act Section under which an assessment may be reopened is a proceeding for assessing income which has escaped assessment The term is also defined as instruction or Knowledge derived from an external source concerning facts or particular or as to law relating to matter bearing on the assessment The term law is used in the sense of norms or guiding principles having legal effect and legal consequences Law may be statutory law enacted by a competent legislative authority or it may be judge made law emanating from a declaration or exposition of the content of a legal principle or the interpretation of a statue and may in particular cases extend to a definition of the status of a party or the legal relationship between the parties the declaration being rendered by a competent judicial or quasi judicial authority empowered to decide questions of law between contending parties The audit of income tax receipts having been entrusted to the Comptroller and Auditor General of India it is intended as an exercise in removing mistakes and errors in income tax records before they are submitted to the scrutiny of the Comptroller and Auditor General a In every case the Income Tax officer must determine for himself what the effect and consequence of the law mentioned in the audit note are and whether in consequence of the law which has come to his notice he can reasonably believe that income had escaped assessment The error discovered by the Income Tax Officer on a reconsideration of the same material and nothing more does not give the Income Tax Officer the power to reopen the assessment What the section envisages is that the Income Tax officer must first have information in his possession and then in consequence of such information he must have reason to believe that income has escaped assessment The realisation that income has escaped assessment is covered by the words reason to believe and it follows from the information received by him The Judgement of the Court was delivered by <NAME> Can the view expressed by an internal audit party of <ORG> on a point of law be regarded as information for the purpose of initiating proceedings under section of the Income Tax Act opinion on the question has been divided among the High Courts and accordingly the present cases have been referred by <ORG> under of the Act It is a professional association of newspapers established with the principal object of promoting the welfare and interest of all newspapers The income from that source was assessed to tax all along as income from business It was so assessed for the years and also <ORG> includes an internal audit organisation whose function it is to examine income tax records and check mistakes made therein with a view ultimately to improve the quality of assessments In the course of auditing the income tax records pertaining to the assessee for the assessment years to the internal audit party expressed the view that the money realised by the assessee on account of the occupation of its conference hall and rooms should not have been assessed as income from business The Appellate Assistant Commissioner allowed the appeals filed by the assessee holding inter alia that in law it could not be said that the Income Tax officer had any information in his possession enabling him to take action under Following the view adopted by <ORG> the Tribunal held that the Income Tax officer had jurisdiction to proceed under The assessee applied for a reference and having regard to the difference between the High Courts on the point the Tribunal has considered it expedient to refer the following question of law directly to this Court Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the Income tax officer was legally justified in reopening the assessments under section for the years and on the basis of the view expressed by the Internal Audit party and received by him subsequent to the original assessment It has been strenuously contended that the view taken by this Court calls for further consideration It acquires finality on the assessment order being made The assessment may also be reopened under section of the Act It is a proceeding for assessing income which has escaped assessment If a the Income Tax officer has reason to believe that by reason of the omission or failure on the part of an assessee to make a return under section for any assessment year to the Income Tax officer or Lo disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for his assessment for that year income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment for that year or notwithstanding that there has been no omission or failure as mentioned in clause a on the part of the assessee the Income tax officer has in consequence of information in his possession reason to believe that income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment for any assessment year he may subject to the provisions of sections to assess or reassess such income or recompute the loss or the depreciation allowance as the case may be for the assessment year concerned In cases falling under section the expression information prescribes one of the conditions upon which a concluded assessment may be reopened under that provision What does information in section connote In <NAME> Commissioner of Income tax this <ORG> construing the corresponding section of the Indian Income Tax Act held the word information to mean not only facts or factual material but to include also information as to the true and correct state of the law and therefore information as to relevant judicial decisions In so far as the word information means instruction or know ledge concerning facts or particulars there is little difficulty When we speak of law we ordinarily speak of norms or guiding principles having legal effect and legal consequences Law may be statutory law or what is popularly described as judge made law Judge made law emanates from a declaration or exposition of the content of a legal principle or the interpretation of a statute and may in particular cases extend to a definition of the status of a party or the legal relationship between parties the declaration being rendered by a competent judicial or quasi judicial authority empowered to decide questions of law between contending parties The internal audit organisation of <ORG> was set up primarily for imposing a check over the arithmetical accuracy of the computation of income and the determination of tax and now because of the audit of income tax receipts being entrusted to the A Comptroller and Auditor General of India from it is intended as an exercise in removing mistakes and errors in income tax records before they are submitted to the scrutiny of the Comptroller and Auditor General He is entitled to examine the accounts in order to ascertain whether the rules and procedures are being duly observed and he is required upon such examination to submit a report Audit does not consider it any part of its duty to pass in review the judgment exercised or the decision taken in individual cases by officers entrusted with those duties but it must be recognised that an examination of such cases may be an important factor in judging the effectiveness of assessment procedure Our attention has been invited to certain provisions of the Internal Audit Manual more specifically defining the functions of internal audit in <ORG> Whether it is the internal audit party of <ORG> or an audit party of the Comptroller and Auditor General they perform essentially administrative or executive functions and cannot be attributed the powers of judicial supervision over the quasi judicial acts of income tax authorities The Income Tax Act does not contemplate such power in any internal audit organisation of <ORG> it recognises it in those authorities only which are specifically authorised to exercise adjudicatory functions But although an audit party does not possess the power to so pronounce on the law it nevertheless may draw the attention of the Income Tax officer to it In the present case an internal audit party of <ORG> expressed the view that the receipts from the occupation of the conference hall and rooms did not attract section of the Act and that the assessment should have been made under section That part alone of the note of an audit party which mentions the law which escaped the notice of the Income Tax officer constitutes information within the meaning of section the part which embodies the opinion of the audit parts in regard to the application or interpretation of the law cannot be taken into account by the Income Tax Officer In every case the Income Tax officer must determine for himself what is the effect and consequence of the law mentioned in the audit note and whether in consequence of the law which has now come to his notice he can reasonably believe that income has escaped assessment Now in the case before us the <ORG> officer had when he made the original assessment considered the provisions of sections and Reliance is placed on <ORG> where a Bench of two learned Judges of this Court observed that a case where income had escaped assessment due to the oversight inadvertence or mistake of the <ORG> officer must fall within section of the Indian <ORG> Act It appears to us with respect that the proposition is stated too widely and travels farther than the statute warrants in so far as it can be said to lay down that if on reappraising the material considered by him during the original assessment the <ORG> officer discovers that he has committed an error in consequence of which income has escaped assessment it is open to him to reopen the assessment That was the view taken by this Court in <ORG> supra <ORG> and Company supra and <ORG> and we do not believe that the law has since taken a different course It is urged that the expression information in section refers to the realisation by the <ORG> officer that he has committed an error when making the original assessment Plainly the statutory provision envisages that the <ORG> officer must first have information in his possession and then in consequence of such information he must have reason to believe that income has escaped assessment The realisation that income has escaped assessment is covered by the words reason to believe and it follows from the information received by the <ORG> officer On appeal by the <ORG> a Bench of two learned Judges of this Court although endorsing the principle enunciated by <ORG> said that the audit department was the proper machinery to scrutinise assessments made by the <ORG> officer and to point out errors of law contained therein and <ORG> had erred in taking the strict view which it did Although the <ORG> did not enhance the valuation of the securities in the appellate proceeding because of the argument advanced by the appellant nonetheless its observations amounted to information as to the law It was not a case where the <ORG> was functioning as an extrajudicial authority performing administrative or executive functions and not competent or authorised to pronounce upon the law <ORG> upheld the reassessment on the finding that the note of the <ORG> and <ORG> had to be taken into account by the Income Tax officer because in his executive capacity he had to be guided by the advice rendered by <ORG> and he had to pay due regard to the note of the <ORG> because the officers of the <ORG> Department were experts empowered to examine and check upon the work of the Income Tax officers But the decision of the case can be supported on the ground that the basic information warranting the re opening of the assessment was the fact that the payment of interest was made to the <ORG> account of the assesses himself That the money so paid did not vest in the Government was a conclusion which followed automatically upon that fact and no controversy in law could possibly arise on that point On the considerations prevailing with us we are of opinion that the view taken by <ORG> and <ORG> in the aforementioned cases is wrong and we must with great respect hold that this <ORG> was in error in the conclusion reached by it is <ORG> merely followed its earlier judgment in Commissioner of Income Tax <NAME> supra and <ORG> was impressed by the same reasons substantially which persuaded <ORG> and <ORG> in the cases referred to above nature and scope of the functions of the internal audit organisation of <ORG> are co extensive with that of Receipt Audit or on the basis of the provisions specifically detailing its functions in the Internal Audit Manual we hold that the opinion of an internal audit party of <ORG> on a point of law cannot be regarded as information within the meaning of section of the Income Tax Act The question referred by <ORG> is answered in the negative in favour of the assessee and against the <ORG> The assessee is entitled to one set of costs in these appeals
