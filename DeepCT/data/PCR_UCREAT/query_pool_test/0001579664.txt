The question for determination in these appeals is whether in the circumstances to be presently stated the plaintiffs who were formerly co sharer landlords with the defendants and others in Mauza Sawas Khurd are entitled to a raiyati interest in certain lands in that village they having purchased an occupancy holding from the tenants many years ago before and having remained in possession thereof paying to their co sharers their proportionate amount of the rent up to the year when they sold their proprietary interest to other co sharers pending partition proceedings which were finally completed in As the lands claimed by each of the plaintiffs fell partly to the share of one set of co sharers on partition and partly to the shara of another each plaintiff brought two suits The <NAME> of Jamui before whom the suits came for trial found in favour of the plaintiffs and passed a decree for possession in each case The defendants have preferred these second appeals to this <ORG> The plaintiffs or their predecessors remained in possession paying a proportionate part of the rent to their co sharers from the date of the purchase until when a suit for partition was instituted before the Subordinate Judge of Monghyr by some of the co sharers Before that date however namely in shortly after the partition proceedings were instituted the plaintiffs sold their proprietary interest to other co sharers who are not parties to this suit and whose names are immaterial By the partition made in the lands in question were included in the takhtas of the defendants who endeavoured to obtain <ORG> possession but found the plaintiffs still in possession with the result that proceedings under Section of the Criminal Procedure Code were instituted and in January terminated in favour of the defendants who dispossessed the plaintiffs When the plaintiffs transferred their proprietary interest to other co sharers in by an agreement then come to between them and their transferees they were permitted to remain in cultivating possession of the lands in suit as formerly and they were not in fact dispossessed until It has been found as a fact in the Courts below that the lands were not the bakasht of the co sharers originally but raiyati jote land acquired by the plaintiffs or their predecessors and this is corroborated by the Record of Rights published in which whilst describing the lands as bakasht of the plaintiffs or their predecessors states that they were formerly an occupancy raiyati jote acquired by them as share holding proprietors and gives the amount of rent which the other co sharers were entitled to under Section of the Bengal Tenancy Act It was argued on behalf of the appellants that the plaintiffs having been parties to the partition suit originally were bound by the decision in that suit in But far as it treated the land as bakasht But even if they are to be treated as parties to the partition suit notwithstanding that they sold their proprietary interest shortly after the suit was instituted and ceased to be interested any longer as proprietors still it has not been shown that there was any issue in the suit as to the nature of the land in question Moreover a new situation arose when the plaintiffs sold their proprietary interest to other co sharers in and took a subordinate interest from them It is not shown that they took any further part in the partition proceedings and in their absence their successors could not by their action deprive them of the rights if any which they acquired at the time when they sold their proprietary interest In my opinion <ORG> was right in holding that the lands were not the bakasht of the joint body of maliks but were originally a raiyati jote purchased by the plaintiffs or their predecessors and subject to the plaintiffs right to hold the same on paying rent to their co sharer and they did not by the partition cease to be lands of this nature The purchasers however allowed the plaintiffs to remain in possession as cultivators by an arrangement come to at the time of the transfer Under the Act as it now exists merger of interest no doubt takes place where the entire interest of the raiyat and his immediate landlord who is either a proprietor or a permanent tenure holder become united in the same person but it is quite different where the occupancy right of a tenant is transferred to a fractional proprietor In the latter case although no occupancy right can vest in the fractional proprietor he still acquires a separate interest in the raiyati holding paying to his co proprietors their share of the rent It is contended however that the Bengal Tenancy Act has no application to the present case as the interest of the plaintiffs was originally acquired before when the first Bengal Tenancy Act was passed and that we must consider the law then existing I can see no reason why under the old law any more than under the present Bengal Tenancy Act this right should cease to exist because the co sharer transfers his interest to another proprietor Whether before the amending Act of the co owner or his transferee could sever the interest by subletting to a tenant may be a question of some difficulty and no authority has been drawn to our attention on the subject but in my opinion it is unnecessary to determine this point for whatever may be said as to the retrospective effect of the first Sub section of Section which limits the rights of a proprietor the second sub section in so far as it refers to the rights of a sublessee which come into operation after the Act must I think apply to all cases where such a sub lease is effected after the passing of the amending Act whether the occupancy right was acquired before or after the passing of that Act or the Act of The point however does not arise for decision for such a right had not matured by twelve years possession when the suit was instituted and I prefer to reserve my decision on this point until the question arises In my opinion the conclusion arrived at by the lower Courts was right in the particular circumstances of the case and these appeals should be dismissed with costs to the contesting respondents together with interest at the usual rate
