HEADNOTE The lands in question are situate in lot Ahiyapur which is one of the villages forming part of the permanently settled estate of Burdwan and had been set apart as Chaukidari Chakaran lands to be held by the Chaukidars for rendering service in the village as watchmen Some time before the enactment of the Bengal Patni Taluks Regulation the entire village of Ahiyapur was granted by the then Zamindar of Burdwan to the predecessors in title of the defendants on Patni settlement In proceedings taken by the Zamindar under the provisions of the Bengal Patni Taluks Regulation the suit lands were brought to sale for arrears of rent and purchased by him The defendants resisted the suit on the ground inter alia that the effect of the grant of the Chaukidari Chakaran lands on June was to make them part and parcel of the Patni settlement of the village of Ahiyapur and that in consequence the sale of those lands apart from the village of Ahiyapur was bad as being a sale of a portion of the Patni Held that when the Zamindar made a grant of the Chaukidari Chakaran lands which formed part of a village which had previously been settled in Patni it was open to the parties to agree that those lands should form a new and distinct Patni and the result of such an agreement would be that while the grantee would hold those lands in Patni right that is to say that the tenure would be permanent heritable and alienable so far as his liability to pay jama and the corresponding right of the Zamindar to sell it under the Regulation if there was a default in the payment thereof were concerned the new grant would be a distinct Patni independent of the original Patni The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> is an appeal by the plaintiff against the judgment of <ORG> in a second appeal which in reversal of the judgments of the Courts below dismissed his suit which was one in ejectment The suit property is a Mahal of the extent of Bighas Cottas situated within lot <NAME> village which is one of the villages forming part of the permanently settled estate of <NAME> This village was granted by the Maharaja of <NAME> in Patni settlement to the predecessors in title of defendants I to Under the Collector is authorized to make an order transferring those lands to the Zamindar after determining the assessment payable thereon and enacts that Such order shall operate to transfer to such zamindar the land therein mentioned subject to the amount of assessment therein mentioned and subject to all contracts theretofore made in respect of under or by virtue of which any person other than the zamindar may have any right to any land portion of his estate or tenure in the place in which such land may be situate In accordance with the provisions aforesaid the suit properties were transferred to the Maharaja of <NAME> and on June he granted the same to the predecessors in title of defendants I to who at that time held the Patni interest in respect of lot <NAME> On February he granted the lands again on Patni to the appellant who filed the suit out of which the present appeal arises in <ORG> <NAME> to recover possession thereof from the defendants alleging that they had trespassed thereon The respondents contested the suit on the ground that in fact there were no arrears of rent due under Exhibit and that the sale was therefore void The Subordinate Judge held that there were arrears of rent due from the respondents and that further as they had not sued to set aside the sale under of the Regulation within the time limited by law they could not set up its invalidity as a defence to the action in ejectment The defendants preferred an appeal against this judgment to <ORG> and there raised a new contention that under the grant Exhibit the suit lands became part of lot <NAME> and that a sale of those lands was illegal as being a sale of a portion of the <ORG> The District Judge after observing that the point was taken for the first time held on a construction of Exhibit that it created a new <ORG> and that it could therefore be brought to sale and he also held that of the Regulation operated as a bar to the validity of the sale being questioned on the ground that the rent claimed was not in fact due He accordingly dismissed the appeal The respondents took the matter in second appeal to <ORG> and that was heard by a Bench consisting of <NAME> and <NAME> who differed from the District Judge both on the construction of Exhibit and on the bar of limitation based on of the Regulation They accordingly allowed the appeal and dismissed the suit It is against this judgment that the present appeal has been brought on a certificate granted by <ORG> under Art Mr <NAME> for the appellant urged the following contentions in support of the appeal The defendants did not raise either in the written statement or during the trial the plea that under the sanad Exhibit the Chaukidari Chakaran lands comprised therein became part of the Patni settlement of lot Ahiyapur and in consequence their sale was bad as being of a part of the Patni and the learned Judges should not have allowed that point to be raised in appeal We see no substance in the first contention It is argued for the appellant that it would be proper in determining the true character of the grant under Exhibit to take into account surrounding circumstances that to ascertain what those circumstances are it will be necessary to take evidence and that in consequence a question of that kind could not be permitted to be agitated for the first time in appeal But it is well settled that no evidence is admissible on a question of construction of a contract or grant which must be based solely on the terms of the document there being no suggestion before us that there is any dispute as to how the contents of the document are related to existing facts true position it is necessary to examine what the rights of the Zamindar and of the Patnidar were with respect to Chaukidari Chakardan lands at the time of the grant Exhibit These lands had been originally set apart as remuneration for the performance of services by the village chaukidars as watchmen and for that reason when the village was granted to the Zamindar in permanent settlement the income therefrom was not taken into account in fixing the jama payable by him though they passed to him under the permanent settlement Then came the Village Chaukidari Act and under that Act the <ORG> put an end to the services of the Chaukidars as village watchmen resumed the lands and imposed assessment thereon and subject to it transferred them to the Zamindar and where the Zamindar had already parted with the village in which the lands were situate by granting Patni it became necessary to define the rights of the Zamindar and the Patnidar with reference to those lands He is under a liability to pay to the Zamindar the assessment due thereon when it is fixed under and also a share of profits It recognises that the grantee is entitled to hold those lands by virtue of his title as Patnidar of the village of which they form part and it fixes the amount payable by him on account of assessment and share of profits But it is open to the parties to agree that the Chaukidari Chakaran lands should form a new and distinct Patni and the result of such an agreement will be that while the grantee will hold those lands in Patni right that is to say the tenure will be permanent heritable and alienable so far as his liability to pay jama and the corresponding right of the Zamindar to sell it under the Regulation if there is any default in the I A If that is the true position then the real question to be considered is what is the agreement of parties with reference to the Chaukidari Chakaran lands whether they are to be constituted as an independent <ORG> or whether they should be treated as a continuation of the original <ORG> or an accretion thereto and the answer to it must depend on the interpretation to be put on the grant Then there is the following clause which is important You will pay the rent etc <NAME> after <NAME> according to the <NAME>bandi in accordance with law and if you do not pay the same I will realise the arrears together with interest and costs by causing the aforesaid lands to be sold by auction by instituting proceedings under Regulation VIII of and other laws which are in force or will come into force Then follow provisions relating to the transfer by the Patnidars of the aforesaid lands succession by inheritance or by will to the aforesaid lands and the registration of the name of the transferee or successor in the Sherista and it is expressly stated that so long as the name of the new Patnidar is not recorded in the Sherista the former Patnidar whose name is recorded in the Sherista will remain liable for the rent and on a sale of the Mahal by auction on institution of proceedings against him under Regulation VIII of or any other law that will be in force for realisation of arrears of rent no objection thereto on the Part of the new Patnidar can be entertained Then there are two clause on which on the respondents rely and they are in these terms If in future it transpires that any other persons besides yourselves have Patni rights in the Patni interest of the said lot <NAME> such persons shall have Patni rights in these Chakaran lands also to the same extent and in the same manner as they will be found to have interests in the Patni of the aforesaid lot and if for the said reason any person puts forward any claim against the Raj Estate and the Raj Estate has to suffer any loss therefor you will make good the said claim and the loss without any objection The first clause provides that if besides the grantee under Exhibit there were other persons entitled to Patni rights in lot <NAME> those persons also shall have Patni rights in Chaukidari Chakaran lands to the same extent as in Patni <NAME> That clearly means that the rights conferred on the grantees under Exhibit have their roots in the Patni lot of <NAME> As against this the appellant argues that the other clauses in Exhibit quoted above strongly support his contention and that when the document is read as a whole it unmistakably reveals an intention to treat the suit lands as a distinct Patni We must now refer to these clauses We have then the clause which provides that when there is default in the payment of kist the lands are liable to be sold in proceedings instituted under the Regulation Now the law had long been settled that a sale of a portion of a Patni is bad but that if by agreement of all the parties interested different portions thereof are held under different sadads which provide for sale of those portions for default in pay ment of kist payable respectively thereon then each of those sanads might be held to have created a separate Patni in respect of the portion comprised therein When therefore the Zamindar and the Patnidar agreed under Exhibit that the lands comprised therein could be sold under the Regulation when there was default in payment of kist fixed therefor they must clearly have intended that those lands should be constituted into a distinct Patni Now it is a settled rule of interpretation that if there be admissible two constructions of a document one of which will give effect to all the clauses therein while the other will render one or more of them nugatory it is the former that should be adopted on the principle expressed in the maxim ut res magis valeat quam per eat Moreover if on an interpretation of the other clauses in the grant the correct conclusion to come to is that it creates a new <ORG> in favour of the grantees thereunder it is difficult to see how the reservation of the rights of the other <ORG>dars of lot Ahiyapur should such there be affects that conclusion Then there is the clause as to the cesser of interest of the grantees in the Chaukidari Chakaran lands when their title to lot <NAME> comes to an end and according to the respondents this shows that under Exhibit the Chaukidari Chakaran lands are treated as part and parcel of the <NAME> Patni If that were so a sale of lot <NAME> must carry with it the Chaukidari Chakaran lands they being ex hypothesi part and parcel thereof and there was no need for a provision such is is made in the last clause We should finally refer to the clauses in Exhibit providing for transfer of or succession to the Chaukidari Chakaran lands and for the recognition of such transferee or successor as a Patnidar of those lands Reading these clauses along with the last clause it seems clear that the intention of the parties was that while a transfer of the <NAME> Patni by sale should extinguish the title of the holders of the Chaukidari Chakaran lands a transfer of these lands would have no effect on the title to the lot <NAME> Patni We must now refer to the decision on which the learned Judges in the <ORG> below have relied in support of their conclusion The Chaukidari Chakaran lands situated within that village were resumed under the Act and transferred to the Zamindar who granted them in to one <NAME> in Patni on terms similar to those in Exhibit In the Patni lot <NAME> was sold under the Regulation and purchased by Sint The defendants who represented the grantees under the Patni settlement of resisted the suit on the ground that the sale of Patni <NAME> did not operate to vest in the purchaser the title in the Chaukidari Chakaran lands as they formed a distinct Patni Dealing with this contention <NAME> who delivered the judgment of the <ORG> observed concerned to alter the terms of the original patni if they chose to do so and what we have to see is whether that was done In order to do that we have to examine the terms of the pattah by which the Chaukidari Chakaran lands were granted to <NAME> The learned Judge then refers to the two clauses cor responding to the last two clauses in Exhibit and comes to the conclusion that their effect was merely to restore the position as it was when the original <ORG> was created and that in consequence the purchaser was entitled to the <ORG> as it was created in A I Cal and that the plaintiff was entitled to the possession of the Chaukidari Chakaran lands as being part of the <ORG> Now it is to be observed that in deciding that the Chaukidari Chakaran lands granted in became merged is lot <NAME> as it was in the learned Judge did not consider the effect of the clause providing for sale of those lands as a distinct entity under the provisions of the Regulation when there was default in the payment of ret payable thereon under the deed and that in our opinion deprives the deci sion of much of its value In the result we are unable to hold that the two clauses on which the learned Judges base their conclusion are really inconsistent with the earlier clauses which support the view that the grant under Exhibit is of a distinct <ORG> If in fact there is a conflict between the earlier clause and the later clauses and it is not possible to give effect to all of them then the rule of construction is well established that it is the earlier clause that must override the later clauses and not vice versa In <NAME> <NAME> Lord <NAME> stated the rule in the following terms If in a deed an earlier clause is followed by a later clause which destroys altogether the obligation created by the earlier clause the later clause is to be rejected as repugnant and the earlier clause prevails We are conscious that we are differing from the learned Judges of the <ORG> below on a question relating to a local tenure on which their opinion is by reason of the special knowledge and experience which they have of it entitled to the greatest weight On the other hand the rule that a portion of a Patni should not be sold being one intended for the benefit of the Patnidars there is no reason why an agreement entered into by them with the Zamindars providing for the sale of a portion thereof which is really to their advantage should not be given effect to Having anxiously considered the matter we have come to the conclusion that Exhibit creates a distinct Patni that the sale thereof on May is valid and that the plaintiff has therefore acquired a good title to the suit lands under the grant dated February In the result the appeal is allowed the judgment of the lower Court reversed and that of the District Judge restored with costs throughout
