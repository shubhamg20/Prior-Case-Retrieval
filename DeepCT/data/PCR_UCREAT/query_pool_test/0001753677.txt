The Appellate Collector of <ORG> by an order dated held that the appellant had produced sufficient evidence to prove that the said Crude PVC films were not marketable and were therefore not liable to excise duty On the appellant filed a classification list in respect of Crude PVC films used for lamination with jute and for tapes claiming that the said PVC films were non excisable on the ground that the same were non marketa ble intermediate products used exclusively for captive consumption On however the Assistant Collector issued a show cause notice calling upon the appellant to show cause as to why the aforesaid films should not be re classified as excisable under Item No A of the <ORG> Tariff Schedule and appropriate duty not recovered under Rule of the <ORG> Rules as these then stood read with Rule The appeal filed against the aforesaid order was reject ed by the Appellate Collector of <ORG> on th October The <ORG> confirmed the order of the Appellate Collector and held that the goods in question fell under Tariff Item No A and were dutiable in the intermediate list and the question of marketability or being capable of being sold in the market was not relevant but modified the order to the extent that duty in respect of clearances prior to the issue of show cause notice was restricted to the period permissible in terms of Rule read with Rule viz Under the <ORG> Act as it stood at the relevant time in order to be goods as specified in the entry the first condition was that as a result of manufac ture goods must come into existence The manufacturer could not be taxed unless manufacturing process resulted in pro duction of goods as known in the market The expression goods manufactured or produced must refer to goods which are capable of being sold to the consumer Simply because a certain article falls within the Schedule it would not be dutiable under excise law if the said article is not goods known to the market The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This is an appeal under Section of the <ORG>s and Salt Act hereinafter referred to as the Act from the order passed and judgment delivered on th April th May by <ORG> New Delhi hereinafter referred to as the Tribunal The appellant filed classification list No XIV dated th November in respect of crude PVC films used for lamination with jute and for tapes claiming that the said PVC films were non excisable on the ground that the same were nonmarketable intermediate products used exclu sively for captive consumption There was an order passed by the Appellate Collector on th June holding that crude PVC films were not mar ketable and were not liable to excise duty Tariff Item A of the Central Excise Tariff reads as follows Articles made of plastics all sorts includ ing tubes rods sheets foils sticks other rectangular or profile shapes The Appellate Collector <ORG> in his order noted the contentions of the appellant that the appellant had produced sufficient evidence to prove that the crude PVC sheets which were the subject matter of the Show Cause Notice in that case and which are also the subject matter of the present show cause notice were not known in the market as PVC sheets nor were these marketable as PVC sheets As such it was contended that the product manufactured by the appellants is not liable to central excise duty Moreover all the processes which are required in case of PVC sheets which are marketed by the appellants so as to make these sheets marketable are not carried out in the case of crude PVC sheets which are used by the appellants in their factory for the manufac ture of leather cloth There was a corrigendum issued on February to the said Show Cause Notice dated th February substituting the words Rule by the words Rule A A reply was given by the appellant to the said Show Cause Notice The present action of re classification in order to make the product excisable some how or other seems to us to be a continuation of the matter which the Super intendent was not able to enforce on us There is no change in the market terminology of PVC Film Our product is not known in the market as PVC Film There was an order passed on th February by the Assistant Collector confirming the Show Cause Notice On th October an appeal was preferred by the appellant against the order of the Assistant Collector dated th February which was rejected by the Appellate Collector of <ORG> It was contended on behalf of the appellant that only marketable PVC film would fall within the said item On the other hand the <ORG> contention was that there was nothing to show that the film sheet was crude and the test of marketability was not relevant In other words the <ORG> view was that if the descrip tion of the goods in question fell into the entry it was dutiable in the intermediate list and as such the goods had become goods as known to the market and the question of marketability or being capable of being sold in the market was not relevant It appears to us that under the Central Excise Act as it stood at the relevant time in order to be goods as specified in the entry the first condition was that as a result of manufacture goods must come into existence In that case the respondents who were manufacturers of vegetable products known as Vanas pati were assessed to excise duty under Item of the First Schedule to the Central Excises and Salt Act on what the taxing authorities called the manufacture of efined oil from raw oil which according to them fell within the description of vegetable non essential oils all sorts in or in relation to the manufacture of which any process is ordinarily carried on with the aid of power The common case made by the respondents in their petition under Article of the Constitution challenging the imposition was that for the purpose of manufacturing Vanaspati they purchased groundnut and til oil from the market and subjected them to different processes before applying hydrogenation to produce Vanaspati and that nothing that they produced at any stage was covered by that item Affidavits by experts were filed by both the parties and <ORG> found in favour of the respondents and allowed the petitions It was urged on its behalf before this <ORG> that before finally producing Vanaspati the respondents produced at an intermediate stage what was known as refined oil in the market and although they might not sell it and although Vanaspati when produced was liable to excise duty under another item that could not affect their liability It was held that excise duty being leviable on the manufacture of goods and not on their sale the petitioners in that case no doubt be liable if they produced refined oil as known in the market at an intermediate stage But the <ORG> found that it was clear that there could be no refined oil as known in the market without deodorisation according to the specification of <ORG> and the affidavits of the experts Since however the process of deodorisation was admittedly applied in the respondents factories only after hydrogenation was com plete they could not be said to produce refined oil at any stage Nor could the respondents be held to manufacture some kind of non essential vegetable oil <NAME> who spoke for the <ORG> at page of the report observed as follows On a consideration of all these materials we have no doubt about the correctness of the respondents case that the raw oil purchased by the respondents for the purpose of manufac ture of Vanaspati does not become at any stage refined oil as is known to the consumers and the commercial community from a judgment of <ORG> and also other relevant authorities this <ORG> held that the definitions made it clear that to become goods an article must be something which can ordinarily come to the market to be bought and sold In order to be goods an article must be some thing which can ordinarily come to the market and is brought for sale and must be known to the market as such Therefore the marketability in the sense that the goods are known in the market or are capable of being sold and purchased in the market is essential SCR where this <ORG> held that the gas generated by the appellant companies in that case was kiln gas and not carbon dioxide as known to the market i to those who deal in it or who use it Therefore the kiln gas in question is neither carbon dioxide nor com pressed carbon dioxide known as such to the commercial community and could not attract duty under Item of the First Schedule It was held by this <ORG> that the duty being on the manufacture and not on the sale the mere fact that kiln gas generated by those concerns was not actually sold did not make any difference if what they generated and used in their manufacturing process was carbon dioxide Justice <NAME> speaking for the <ORG> at page of the report observed The Act charges duty on manufacture of goods The word manufacture implies a change but every change in the raw material is not manu facture There must be such a transformation that a new and different article must emerge having a distinctive name character or use The duty is levied on goods As the Act does not define goods the legislature must be taken to have used that word in its ordinary dictionary meaning The dictionary meaning is that to become goods it must be something which can ordinarily come to the market to be bought and sold and is known to the market In that view of the matter the <ORG> came to the conclusion that the gas generated by these concerns was kiln gas and not carbon dioxide as known to the trade i to those who deal in it or who use it The expression goods manufactured or produced must refer to goods which are capable of being sold to the consumer This <ORG> observed as follows It does not seem to us that in order to attract excise duty the article manufactured must be capable of sale to a consumer Entry of List I of Schedule VII to the Constitu tion specifically speaks of duties of excise on tobacco and other goods manufactured or produced in India and it is now well accepted that excise duty is an indirect tax in which the burden of the imposition is passed on to the ultimate consumer In that context the expression goods manufactured or produced must refer to articles which are capable of being sold to a consumer The Judicial Commit tee of <ORG> in Governor General in Council Province of Madras this Court observed at page of the report that excise duty was primarily a duty on the production or manufacture of goods produced or manufactured within the country Section of the Act enjoins that there shall be levied and collected in such manner as may be prescribed duties of excise on all excisable goods other than salt which are produced or man ufactured in India Excisable goods under section of the Act means goods specified in the Schedule to the Central Tariff Act as being subject to a duty of excise and includes salt Therefore it is necessary in a case like this to find out whether there are goods that is to say articles as known in the market as separate distinct identi fiable commodities and whether the tariff duty levied would be as specified in the Schedule Simply because a certain article falls within the Schedule it would not be dutiable under excise law if the said article is not goods known to the market It appears from the facts as aforesaid before that the crude PVC films as produced by the appellant in this case were not known in the market and could not be sold in the market and was not capable of being marketable Mr <NAME> on the other hand submitted that as it was found that the goods were not marketable by the Appellate Collector in the order of and no evidence was adduced before the Tri<ORG> to the contrary and the Tri<ORG> refused to consider the question of marketability no useful purpose would be served in remanding the matter to the Tri<ORG> As mentioned before the Appellate Collector has on held that the crude PVC sheets films which formed the subject matter of the appeal are manufactured by the appellant for the production of leather cloth in the factory are not marketable as PVC sheets and had allowed the appeal because he found that because PVC sheets of the gauges manufactured by the appellants are invariably either embossed or printed or both After the GEL is formed in such PVC sheets and resins get fused with plastisizer they are further subjected to the processing of finish ing embossing printing The tensile strength of PVC sheets which are marketed as such and the crude PVC sheets which are used by the appellants in their factory for the manufacture of leather cloth are as under Marketable PVC sheets Thickness Tensile strength Per cm In that view of the matter that there being no contrary evidence found by the <ORG> in this case subsequent to the finding by the Appellate <ORG> we are of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed and no excise duty should be charged under section A of the Central Excise Tariff on the Crude PVC sheets
