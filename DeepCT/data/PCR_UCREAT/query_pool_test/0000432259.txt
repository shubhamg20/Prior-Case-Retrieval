The present appellant <NAME> had made an application under Section of the Code of Civil Procedure The present respondent <NAME> had obtained a decree against the appellant for a certain sum for rent The decree was dated July and that decree was put to execution and proceedings which were described as Rent Execution Case No of in <ORG> at Burdwan were started Subsequently on August there was an agreement between the parties as to the method in which the decree was to be satisfied or to put the matter in another way there was an adjustment of the decree By that agreement the amount due under the decree was made payable by certain instalments and there was a provision in the agreement for payment of interest at a certain rate It also contained a provision that if the judgment debtor failed to pay any instalment in proper time the decree holder would be entitled to realise the whole amount by means of execution proceedings In June there were further proceedings in execution which were described as Rent Execution Case No of It is obvious that there are no real merits in this case as regards the attitude adopted by the judgment debtor or on the contentions pat forward on his behalf Then he said The period of limitation will run from the date of adjustment The Subordinate Judge on all material points agreed with the view taken by the learned <NAME> and he seems to have come to the conclusion that In the present case the <ORG> varied the decree by noting the instalments in <ORG> There are however a number of authorities chiefly it is true in other <ORG> and one or two in this <ORG> in which a contrary view has been taken and in my opinion it is extremely doubtful whether the proposition laid down in the case of <NAME> <NAME> supra is really good law If in the present circumstances it was simply a question of our having to decide that whether in any circumstances it is possible for an agreement between the parties to supersede a decree of the <ORG> and then to put it to execution as if it were itself a decree it would be extremely difficult to hold that the parties can by an agreement substitute as it were a fresh decree in place of the original decree or even vary the terms of the original decree But in the present instance it is clear from the dates that the present execution proceedings were instituted at a time when more than three years had elapsed from the date of the original decree The original decree was made on July and these proceedings were instituted in August so that whether the matter falls within the provisions of the ordinary law of limitation or under the provisions of the Bengal Tenancy Act it was outside the period prescribed In that view of the matter we come to the conclusion that this appeal must be allowed But having regard to the circumstances we make no order as to costs I agree with my learned brother that this appeal should be allowed In the first execution case there was an adjustment between the parties on August by which the judgment debtor agreed to pay the decretal amount by cert in instalments I agree that the appeal should be allowed and having regard to the conduct of the judgment debtor no cost should be allowed to him
