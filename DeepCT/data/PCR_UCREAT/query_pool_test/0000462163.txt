Claiming to be the champions to the cause of vegetarians the Appellant Nos and along with the heirs of the erstwhile land owners Appellant Nos to herein moved <ORG> by way of a writ petition filed in public interest with prayer for the issuance of a writ in the nature of mandamus commanding the respondents to forbear from using or utilising the acquired lands for the purposes other than the one for which the acquisition was made It was further prayed that directions be issued to give back the lands in question to the erstwhile land owners or to sell the land by public auction only for the public purpose Pending adjudication of the main petition an injunction was prayed for restraining the respondents from using or utilising any part or portion of land in question for any slaughter house abattoir and restraining the respondent No from allowing respondent No to establish or operate any slaughter house abattoir on the land in question Vide order dated the learned Single Judge of <ORG> dismissed the writ petition and the appeal filed against the order of the learned Single Judge was dismissed by <ORG> of <ORG> vide the judgment impugned in this appeal The facts leading to the filing of the present appeal are that by notification dated nd August issued under the Land Acquisition Act <ORG> acquired land measuring acres for a public purpose namely construction of Mourigram Dankuni Link Project of South Eastern <ORG> After completion of the project the <ORG> surrendered the surplus land measuring acres to <ORG> on <ORG> was authorised to set up <ORG> on this land It was contended that the respondents were encroaching upon the Constitutional Rights of the appellants by establishing a slaughter house abattoir on the land acquired for a specified public purpose The delay in filing Writ Petition was sought to be explained on the ground that respondents had allegedly kept the deal a guarded secret Approximate market value at Mourigram has been assessed at Rs per acre for Danga Bastu Bagan land Rs per acre for Sali Rs per acre for Doba Rs per acre for Khal If you do not use the land within a reasonable time for the purpose for which it is given <ORG> The lease deed was executed between the parties on th June on terms and conditions which were incorporated in Part II of the Schedule attached to the said lease deed The writ petition was dismissed on th September and appeal filed against it met the same fate on vide the judgment impugned in this appeal It is contended that the respondent <ORG> without issuing any advertisement or resorting to the procedure of auction and tender has secretly leased out the land which has resulted in huge monetary loss worth crores of rupees to the <ORG> exchequer It is submitted that in the light of the pleadings and the record produced before it <ORG> was justified in dismissing the writ petition filed by the appellants It is argued that there is no defect or error of law in the decision making process of <ORG> by which the land has been leased out to respondent No It is conceded that though the documents executed between the parties is styled as a lease deed yet in fact it is a sale as the whole of the then prevalent market value of the land has been paid by the respondent No The lease deed is stated to have been got executed for keeping interests of the <ORG> alive in the land which in no way affects the public interest but in effect is adverse to the interests of the respondent No Relying upon the judgments of this Court in AIR SC and SCC the learned Single Judge held that once the property has been vested unto the <ORG> under Section of the Land Acquisition Act neither the previous owner nor their successors in interest can question the dealing and disposal of the property by the <ORG> Referring to the decisions of this Court reported in AIR SC and AIR SC and analysing the facts of the case the learned Single Judge held There are enough materials placed before me which unmistakably substantiate that Mr <NAME> client has brought a promise and or hope that at least employed youths would be provided in this industry So in my view when the <ORG> utilizes a land in furtherance of development of industry and or earning foreign exchange the same is nothing short of public purpose notwithstanding a statement made in clause of the lease deed The statements made in clause of the lease at best operate as admission In appeal while upholding the judgment of the learned Single Judge <ORG> dealt with the submissions of the appellants to the effect that the land should have been sold by public auction if after acquisition it was not used for any other public purpose by the <ORG> Agreeing with the learned Single Judge it was held by <ORG> in appeal that We are however of the opinion that this court is not at all required to be satisfied whether a surplus land has been utilised for a public purpose After acquisition of the land in accordance with the procedure established by law a surplus land has vested in the <ORG> free from all encumbrances Article empowers the <ORG> to carry on any trade or business and make contracts for any purpose Finding that no allegations of malafide and discrimination had been pleaded in the petition <ORG> was held competent to enter into contracts with private persons for disposal of the property irrespective of the purpose of such acquisition or disposition subject only to the condition of compliance with the relevant provisions of the Constitution He has conceded that the erstwhile owners of the land had no right to ask for the return of the land to them Whether any advertisement was issued or not or whether public auction or floating of tenders should have been dispensed with or not are such matters which require pleadings in order to enable <ORG> to explain or justify their action in the circumstances of the case The appeal before <ORG> of <ORG> and in this <ORG> being in continuation of the original proceedings in the form of writ petition cannot enlarge the scope of inquiry at this belated stage Learned counsel appearing for the respondents have brought to our notice that in fact the value charged from respondents No was the market value of the land and not lease money as urged In this regard in the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the respondent No in this <ORG> it is stated In order that the proper and correct lease premium and lease rent were arrived at a valuation of the land in question was caused to be made by the Special Land Acquisition Officer By the memo no dated th January of the District Magistrate Howrah a copy whereof is annexed hereto and marked Annexure the valuation Report in Case No was forwarded to the Secretary <ORG> of the Government of West Bengal Officer The public purpose which the <ORG> had in mind has been spelt out in its affidavit as under In finalising the lease terms and conditions and the proposal of the respondent no the fact that setting up of the said industry in the low lying land at Mourigram would not only provide employment to more than persons which estimate was provided even by <ORG> Australia in its feasibility study report carried out in the year as aforesaid and indirect employment to large number of persons in West Bengal were taken into consideration It was also taken into consideration that setting up an industry in such a semi rural area in Mourigram a Gram Panchayat area under Duillya Gram Panchayat of Zilla Parishad Howrah would help in industrialisation of the said area and consequently the State of West Bengal It has been consistently held by this Court that in a democracy governed by the rule of law the <ORG> JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ Government or any of its officers cannot be allowed to JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ possess arbitrary powers over the interests of the individual Dealing with the limits on the exercise of <ORG> authority in relation to rule of administrative justice Mr Justice <NAME> in <NAME> <NAME> US Ed said An executive agency must be rigorously held to the standards by which it professes its action to be judged Accordingly if dismissal from employment is based on a defined procedure even though generous beyond the requirements that bind such agency that procedure must be scrupulously observed He that takes the procedural sword shall perish with the sword Though the <ORG> cannot escape its liability to show its actions to be fair reasonable and in accordance with law JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ yet wherever challenge is thrown to any of such action JJJJJJJJJJJJJ initial burden of showing the prima facie existence of violation of the mandate of the Constitution lies upon the person approaching the Court We have found in this case that the appellants have miserably failed to place on record or to point out to any alleged constitutional vice or illegality It may be noticed that in the year the erstwhile owners were paid about Rs lakhs and the <ORG> Government assessed the market value of the property which was paid by respondent No at Rs The appellants have themselves stated that the value of the land round about the time when it was leased to respondent No was about Rs crores There cannot be any dispute with the proposition that generally when any <ORG> land is intended to be transferred or the <ORG> largesse decided to be conferred resort should be had to public auction or transfer by way of inviting tenders from the people <ORG> cannot be expected to presume the alleged irregularities illegalities or unconstitutionality nor the courts can substitute their opinion for the bonafide opinion of the <ORG> executive SCC it was held that as regards the question of propriety of private negotiation with an individual or corporation it should be borne in mind that <ORG> owned or public owned property is not to be dealt with at the absolute discretion of the executive One of the methods of securing the public interest when it is considered necessary to dispose of the property is to sell the property by public auction or by inviting tenders There may be situations where there are compelling reasons necessitating departure from the rule In that case on facts the Court found that on the commercial and financial aspect the lease granted in favour of a group of hoteliers not arbitrary as the method of nett sales was held to be fairly well known method adopted in similar situations AIR SC this Court after referring to various judgments including the judgment in <NAME> case held It is imperative in a democracy governed by the rule of law that governmental action must be kept within the limits of law and if there is any transgression the <ORG> must be ready to condemn it It is a matter of historical experience that there is a tendency in every government to assume more and more powers and since it is not an uncommon phenomenon in some countries that the legislative check is getting diluted it is left to the <ORG> as the only other reviewing authority under the Constitution to be increasingly vigilant to ensure observance with the rule of law and in this task the court must not flinch or falter It may be pointed out that this ground of invalidity namely that the governmental action is unreasonable or lacking in the quality of public interest is different from that of mala fides though it may in a given case furnish evidence of mala fides In the instant case as a policy decision protective measure by entering into agreements with selected industrial units for assured supply of sal trees at concessional rate has been taken by the <ORG> The rate of royalty has also been fixed on some accepted principle of pricing formula as will be indicated hereafter Hence distribution or allotment of sal seeds at the determined royalty to the respondents and other units covered by the agreements cannot be assailed It is to be appreciated that in case distribution by public auction or by open tender may not achieve the purpose of the policy of protective measure by way of supply of sal seeds at concessional rate of royalty to the industrial units covered by the agreements on being selected on valid and objective considerations It was further held that principle of reasonableness and non arbitrariness in governmental action is the core of our entire Constitutional scheme and structure On the facts of that case the action of <ORG> in granting a contract by way of negotiation was held not arbitrary or irrational In the backdrop of the legal position noticed herein it has to be seen in the instant case as to whether the action of the respondent No was illegal arbitrary or malafide To justify their action of entering into an agreement of lease by negotiation even in the absence of pleadings on behalf of the appellants the <ORG> has submitted that the entire transaction of granting the lease to the respondent No for an integrated food processing unit with an abattoir in a semi rural area which was a low lying land despite their best efforts the state Government were unable to set up any project The lease was given to respondent No upon consideration of all the facts and circumstances with the object of setting up an industry in the <ORG> of West Bengal which was likely to generate employment to more than persons and earn foreign exchange worth more than Rs crores The Government had decided to make a package deal for the purposes of transferring the Durgapur Project and establishment of <ORG> It is further stated in the counter affidavit of the respondent <ORG> that Since no response was received from the advertisements and the personal requests made in the manner above by the Minister in charge of the Department from any concern except as aforesaid the <ORG> took into account the credentials of the group of companies of which <ORG> was one including the export award certificate awarded to <ORG> for outstanding contribution for promotion of agricultural and processed food products during the year as proof of their excellence in their field and thereupon proceeded to finalise the lease terms and conditions under which inter alia the Mourigram land would be leased out to the respondent No for setting up of an integrated food processing unit along with an abattoir products whereof could be exported as well as sold in the <ORG> of West Bengal Under the circumstances we do not find any ground to interfere with the impugned judgments or the action of the JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ respondent State in granting the lease to respondent No JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ The appeal is accordingly dismissed but without any order as to costs
