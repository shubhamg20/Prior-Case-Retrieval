Challenge in these appeals is to the direction given to the <ORG> by <ORG> of <ORG> to dispose of application for renewal filed by the respondents expeditiously in the background of views expressed on the factual aspects Shorn of theatric and bereft of legal controversy which constitutes bulk of the armoury as regards attack to the legality of judgment of <ORG> by which four Letters Patent Appeals were disposed of the factual background is as follows There is a marked distinction between periods have been prescribed for currency of the concerned permits Though applications for renewal were filed with requisite fees no express order was passed in any of the cases declining to grant permit Grievance is made that no reason has been indicated and there is also no reference to any policy decision for not effecting the renewal With reference to earlier order passed by <ORG> in the case of <ORG> and Anr <ORG> and the counter affidavit filed by the present appellants the writ applications were dismissed In the said case <ORG> noticed that renewal of permission was not a matter of right since there was change in <ORG> policy <ORG> was appointed which submitted its recommendations and in that view of the matter there was no question of directing renewal of the permits The High <ORG> inter alia came to the conclusions that renewal of the permit is a valuable right it could be refused only on cogent and valid grounds though plea was taken that the renewal period was mentioned by mistake same appears to be an afterthoughts and the concerned authorities were required to consider the prayer for renewal of the permit in accordance with law The earlier decision in <ORG> supra was not a binding precedent as several relevant provisions had not been brought to the notice of <ORG> hearing the case In support of the appeals Mr <NAME> learned Solicitor General submitted that <ORG> has lost sight of the fact that if the license permit is renewed it would be only by going against the specific stipulations in the policy decision <ORG> was not justified in its conclusion that there was legitimate expectation or promissory estoppel involved and that the policy decision was contrary to the statute Responding to the aforesaid pleas learned counsel for the respondents submitted that <ORG> judgment is flawless and suffers from no infirmity to warrant interference It was highlighted that in respect of vessels a departure was made from the so called policy and they were permitted to fish in the concerned zone I was further pointed out that <ORG> has not in reality granted any relief to which the applicants were entitled in law By way of reply to the submissions made by learned counsel for the respondents learned Solicitor General submitted that directions were not merely to consider Had it been so and the matter would have been left open to be decided in accordance with law there could have been no difficulty The said EXIM policy in the year allowed import of deep sea fishing vessels by surrendering special import licence which had been done in the case of the concerned vessels and therefore the licences on those cases have no relevance so far as the present appeals are concerned Even if it is conceded for the sake of argument that there was anything improper in the permission granted it may be ground for taking action against the concerned vessels but it cannot be a ground to renew licence of the applicants Though there can be quarrel with the proposition that renewal of a permit carries with it a valuable right it cannot be lost sight of that for outweighing reasons of public interest renewal can be refused If at the time when the matter is taken up for considering whether renewal to be granted there is a change in policy it cannot be said that the right is defeated by introduction of a policy In such an event the question of applying doctrine of legitimate expectation or promissory estoppel looses significance Indisputably public interest has to prevail over private interest The case at hand shows that a conscious policy decision has been taken and there is no statutory compulsion to act contrary In that context it cannot be said that respondents have acquired any right for renewal What remains now to be considered is the effect of permission granted to the vessels As highlighted by learned counsel for the appellants even if it is accepted that there was any improper permission that may render such permissions vulnerable so far as vessels are concerned But it cannot come to the aid of respondents A party cannot claim that since something wrong has been done in another case direction should be given for doing another wrong It would not be setting a wrong right but would be perpetuating another wrong In such matters there is no discrimination involved The concept of equal treatment on the logic of Article of the Constitution of India in short the Constitution cannot be pressed into service in such cases It does not countenance repetition of a wrong action to bring both wrongs or par Even if hypothetically it is accepted that wrong has been committed on some other cases by introducing a concept of negative equality respondents cannot strengthen their case They have to establish strength of their case on some other basis and not by claiming negative equality It is SIC law that Article of the Constitution applies also to matters of governmental policy and if the policy or any action of the <ORG> even in contractual matters fails to satisfy the test of reasonableness it would be unconstitutional A basic and obvious test to apply in such cases is to see whether there is any discernible principle emerging from the impugned action and if so does it really satisfy the test of reasonableness Where a particular mode is prescribed for doing an act and there is not impediment in adopting the procedure the deviation to act in different manner which does not disclose any discernible principle which is reasonable itself shall be labelled as arbitrary On the contrary curial views of policy have been subjected to stringent criticism As Professor <NAME> points out in Administrative Law by <NAME> th Edition there is ample room within the legal boundaries for radical differences of opinion in which neither side is unreasonable Nor is the test <ORG> own standard of reasonableness as it might conceive it in a given situation In a given case whether there are such facts and circumstance giving rise to legitimate expectation would primarily be a question of fact SC the change in policy can defeat a substantive legitimate expectation if it can be justified on Wednesbury reasonableness The decision maker has the choice in the balancing of the pros and cons relevant to the change in policy The legitimate substantive expectation merely permits the <ORG> to find out if the change of policy which is the cause for defeating the legitimate expectation is irrational or perverse or one which no reasonable person could have made A claim based on merely legitimate extension without anything more cannot ipso facto give a right The present is an we experience it the past is a present memory and future is a present expectation Legitimacy of an expectation can be inferred only if it is founded on the sanction of law As observed in Attorney General for New Southwale <NAME> Australian LJR to strike the exercise of administrative power solely on the ground of avoiding the disappointment of the legitimate expectations of an individual would be to set the courts adrift on a featureless sea of pragmatism Moreover the negotiation of a legitimate expectation falling short of a legal right is too nebulous to form a basis for invalidating the exercise of a power when its exercise otherwise accords with law If a denial of legitimate expectation in a given case amounts to denial of right guaranteed or is arbitrary discriminatory unfair or biased gross abuse of power or violation of principles of natural justice the same can be questioned on the well known grounds attracting Article but a claim based on mere legitimate expectation without anything more cannot ipso facto give a right to invoke these principles It can be one of the grounds to consider but the court must lift the veil and see whether the decision is violative of these principles warranting interference It depends very much on the facts and the recognized general principles of administrative law applicable to such facts and the concept of legitimate expectation which is the latest recruit to a long list of concepts fashioned by the courts for the review of administrative action must be restricted to the general legal limitations applicable and binding the manner of the future exercise of administrative power in a particular case It follows that the concept of legitimate expectation is not the key which unlocks the treasure of natural justice and it ought not to unlock the gates which shuts the court out of review on the merits particularly when the element of speculation and uncertainty is inherent in that very concept Otherwise a resourceful litigant having vested interest in contract licences etc Reasonableness of restriction is to be determined in an objective manner and from the standpoint of interests of the general public and not from the standpoint of the interest of persons upon whom the restrictions have been imposed or upon abstract consideration The reasonableness of the legitimate expectation has to be determined with respect to the circumstances relating to the trade or business in question Cancalization of a particular business in favour of even a specified individual is reasonable where the interests of the country are concerned or where the business affects the economy of the country Keeping in view the analysis made of legal positions and in the absence of any material to discount legitimacy of policy the respondents have not made out a case for interference Costs made easy
