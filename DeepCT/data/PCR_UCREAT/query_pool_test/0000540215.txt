The circumstances giving to this appeal are as follows <NAME> respondent was at the material time posted as Superintendent of police Guedaspur He followed this by a reminder dated requesting the controller to make necessary arrangements for the supply of types and tubes at an early date The controller of stores in reply sent the letter dated requesting the respondent to send his demand in the new prescribed from the controller of printing and stationary Punjab On the th July <NAME> proceeded in the <ORG> jeep no PNP registered in the name of Superintendent of police Gurdaspur on official duty to Pathankot It was raining at about when the jeep was on the road near village Paniar it skidded and overturned as a result on which <NAME> received injuries Mr <NAME> therefore made an application to <ORG> Punjab chandiaarh claiming rs In its written statement the state denied its liability to pay any compensation It was added that the officer had taken out the jeep on the road against the instructions of the Inspector General of police and that the superintendent of police Gurdaspur being himself the registered owner of the vehicle could not claim compensation against himself Was the accident due to any negligence on the part of the driver of the vehicle or due to any defect in the vehicle involved in the accident after recording the evidence produced by the parties the <ORG> found The accident no doubt took place because the tyres were worn out and had become unserviceable and the driver was not to blame as it was raining that day and the tyres slipped but the driver was negligent in the performance of his duties as he did take the defective vehicle on the road and did not inform his officer about its unserviceable that day The two pronged issue No was thus decided entirely in favour of the claimant It was further directed that the amount be paid within a month of the date of the award failing which it will carry interest at per annum This act of the claimant <NAME> and his constable driver in taking out the jeep which was not in a roadworthy condition on that rainy day amounted to an offence under section of the Motor Vehicles Act read with Rules and of the Motor Vehicles Rules the state was not liable because no negligence either on the part of the controller in not supplying the new tyres or the driver in driving the vehicle was established Mr <NAME> the learned Counsel for the claimant respondent contends occurred as a result of the negligence of the appellant <ORG> in not replacing the worn out tyres of the government jeep in time despite requisitions made by the claimant secondly even if there was no such negligence the liability of the <ORG> to compensate its servant for an injury sustained by him in the performance of his duty was absolute It is true that there is nothing either in Ss A or of the Motor Vehicles Act which says that compensation can be awarded by <ORG> only when negligence on the part of the driver of the vehicle concerned is established These provisions however do not lay down any criterion for awarding compensation They merely substitute the Motor Accidents claims tribunal for the Civil courts for adjudicating claims to compensation in respect of accidents involving death of or bodily injury to persons arising our of the use of motor vehicles They do not deal with the question as to who is to be held liable and in what circumstances if any injury results from an accident For fixing liability in the absence of any specific statutory provision we have to go back to the law of torts according to which generally speaking negligence in causing the accident is essential to hold the negligent person liable As observed by I dua in shri ram Pertap case Pun LR AIR Punj the cardinal principle of liability on tort when death or bodily injury has been caused to a person is negligence or failure to take the requisite amount of care required by law AIR Punj the accident in which the claimant received injuries while travelling in a bus run by the state was not proved to be due to any rash or negligent act of the driver It was held that the claimant was not entitled to claim any compensation from the state for the injuries received by him sic HL reversing it was laid down that a person who brings dangerous things on his land and a harm results due to their escape is liable They have to give a new look to the old principles in the light of the present day circumstances The courts play a limited role in this process by placing what is called a dynamic interpretation on principles which carry behind them the sanction of tradition and precedent Leaving aside the cases governed by special statutory provisions such as Workmen compensation Act in cases of the kind before me negligence on the part of the master or his agent must be proved before he can be fastened with the liability to compensate his servant sustaining an injury in the course of the service The above being the law on the point I pass on to consider whether in the present case the accident resulting in injury to the claimant was due to negligence actual or presumed on the part of the employer <ORG> or its servant the driver of the vehicle concerned There is nothing on the record to show that the claimant respondent had sent his demand in the prescribed form thereafter On the other hand the controller of stores in his letter Exhibit dated clearly intimated the claimant respondent that further action in the matter could be taken only on respect of his demand on the prescribed indent forms No UF Thus it was not established that there was any negligence on the part of the appellant or its servant the controller of stores in not replacing the worn out tyres of the vehicle in time Indeed there was negligence on the part of the claimant in not making the demand well in time in the prescribed form <ORG> also has not recorded any clear finding that there was negligence on the part of the state in replacing the worn out tyres though it has said that the accident occurred due to the defect in the tyres It was the claimant own case that the tyres of the vehicle had become worn out and unserviceable and they required urgent replacement The knowledge of the claimant about the worn out condition of the tyres can be inferred from the circumstances that he wrote to the controller as far back as the th June that the tyres and tubes of the <ORG> jeep and other transport vehicles were urgently needed by him He followed up this letter by a reminder dated Thereafter he received the reply of the controller that the requisition should be sent in the prescribed form This act of the driver in driving that dangerous and unsafe vehicle on that rainy day with its unserviceable tyres and also act of <NAME> in allowing his subordinate driver to drive the vehicle on that day might amount to the commission of an offence by the claimant as well as the driver under section of the Motor Vehicles Act Any person who drives or cause or allows to be driven in any public place a motor vehicle or trailer while the vehicle or trailer has any defect which such person knows of or could have discovered by the exercise of ordinary care and which is calculated to render the driving of the vehicle a source of danger to persons and vehicles using such place shall be punishable with fine which may extend to two hundred and fifty rupees or if as a result of such defeat an accident is caused causing bodily injury or damage to property with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three months or with fine which may extend to one thousand rupees with both His duties were to travel round the district show samples take orders and deliver goods and for that purpose he was supplied by the defendants with a motor car the starting gear of which was defective In an action brought by the plaintiff to recover damages in respect of personal injury resulting from the negligence of the defendants it was held that the plaintiff notwithstanding his knowledge of the defect in the starting gear had never undertaken or consented to take upon himself the risks arising from continuing to use the car that he had sustained the injury owing to the personal negligence of the defendants and that not having been guilty of contributory negligence he was entitled to recover I will then have it seen to when you get back and you can go your next round by rail The claimant has not alleged much less proved that the official work for which he had to travel on that day was so urgent and paramount that he could not as a devoted and faithful servant of the state avoid and that in the circumstances he had no choice but to use this very defective jeep It is apparent from the letter written by the claimant to the controller that there were several <ORG> transport vehicles under his control Indeed it was never the claimant case that the exigencies of the official mission to be performed by him were so urgent and imminent that he had no choice but to travel in this defective jeep except at the cost of committing dereliction of the official duty and the consequent incurrence of displeasure of the master There was no proof that the master had done some act either by issuing peremptory direction to the servant to use this defective vehicle on that day and thereby expose him to danger or had in any manner put the servant in that dangerous situation which he could not by the exercise of ordinary diligence or discretion avoid Now what does the duty of care involve The answer is supplied by the well known words of <NAME> in <ORG> Ex where he defines negligence as the omission to do something which a reasonable man guided upon those considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct of human affairs would do or doing something which a prudent and reasonable man would not do It follows therefore that a master may be liable for a danger or defect causing hurt to his servant not only where he knew but where he ought to have known of it The negligence may be either a where he knows and negligently fails ro remedy or where he ought to have known but negligently fails in acquiring knowledge and therefore negligently fails to remove the danger or defect I do not agree that the case is covered by the principle or res ipsa loquitur The rule applicable to such cases was enunciated as follows Where the thing is shown to be under the management of the defendant or his servants and the accident is such as in the ordinary course of things does not happen it those who have the management use proper care it affords reasonable evidence in the absence of explanation by the defendant that the accident arose from want of care that is to say it was under the management of the claimant himself and the accident would not have happened if the claimant who had the management and control used proper care either to get the tyres replaced in time or to avoid using this dangerously unsafe vehicle on that rainy day The rule of res ipsa loquitur which for the sake of convenience maybe called the rule of presumptive negligence on part of the defendant has therefore no application to the facts of the <ORG> case It is not necessary for me to over burden this judgment by discussing all the cases cited by Mr <NAME> For all the reasons aforesaid I have no hesitation in holding that the claimant was not entitled to any compensation In the result I would allow this appeal and dismiss the claimant application leaving the parties to bear their own costs throughout
