Following question has been referred under Section of the Income tax Act in short the Act Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the <ORG> was correct in law to give a finding that the assessed was not covered by section of the Income tax Act or any other provision of Section and thereby allowing its claim for exemption from tax of its dividend income of the Income tax Act Factual position in a nutshell is as follows assessed is a public charitable trust which was originally registered as a society under the name <ORG> under the Societies Registration Act on There were seven subscribers to the Memorandum of Association of whom three namely Sir <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> constituted <ORG> In respect of these shares received as donation by the <ORG> <ORG> issued bonus shares and thus the <ORG> came to hold shares of <ORG> Thus the percentage of shares held by excluded persons came to while that of shares held by the <ORG> worked out to We have heard the learned counsel for revenue and for the assessed Stand of the learned counsel for the <ORG> is that there is scope for misuse and evasion of tax if interpretation given by the <ORG> is accepted The language of the provisions according to him shows that the amount must have remained invested for a specific period and merely because for the sake of argument it can be said that originally the amount was not invested by the assessed yet when it remained invested subsequently the provision of Section are applicable If it was originally not invested the question of funds remaining invested in the manner suggested by the learned counsel for <ORG> is not borne out from the statute In order to appreciate rival submissions the relevant provisions need to be noted Sections and at the relevant time read as follows Section Subject to provisions of sections and the following income shall not be included in the total income of the previous year of the person in receipt of the income a income derived from property held under trust wholly for charitable or religious purposes to the extent to which such income is applied to such purposes in India and where any such income is accumulated or set apart for application to such purposes in India to the extend to which the income so accumulated or set apart is not in excess of twenty five per cent of the income from such property any voluntary contributions received by a trust created wholly for charitable or religious purposes or by an institution established wholly for such purposes not being contributions made with a specific direction that they shall form part of the corpus If the trust or institution shall for the purposes of section be deemed to be income derived from property held under trust wholly for charitable or religious purposes and the provisions of that section and Section shall apply accordingly Nothing contained in Section or section shall operate so as to exclude from the total income of the previous year of the person in receipt thereof a in the case of a trust for charitable or religious purposes or a charitable or religious institution any income thereof i ii if any part of such income or any property of the trust or the institution whenever created or established is during the previous year used or applied directly or indirectly for the benefit of any person referred to in sub section Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions of clause and clause of sub section the income or the property of the trust or institution or any part of such income or property shall for the purposes of that clause be deemed to have been used or applied for the benefit of a person referred to in sub section if any funds of the trust or institution are or continue to remain invested for any period during the previous year not being a period before the st day of January in any concern in which nay person referred to in sub section has a substantial interest A similar issue had come up before various High Courts and there is unanimity in the view as that taken by the <ORG> Funds means money in hand or cash according to some dictionaries The expression invest connotes a positive act on the part of the trust whereby the funds of the trust are laid out or committed in any particular property or business or transaction with the object of earning a profit or financial advantage or return What is contemplated is that the trust having assets in the form of money or cash or balance in a bank or any other form capable of being invested or by a positive act and pursuant to a decision of the trust was laid out or committed in a concern of a nature specified before it can be held that such an investment comes within the mischief of Section The meaning of expression funds given in the standard dictionaries are as follows Black Law dictionary Fifth Edition Fund An asset or group of assets set aside for a specific purpose A generic term and all embracing as compared with term money etc which is specific A sum of money or other liquid assets set apart for a specific purpose or available for the payment of debts or claims In the plural this word has a variety of slightly different meanings as follows moneys and much more such a notes bills cheques drafts stocks and bonds and in broader meaning may include property of every kind Money in hand assets cash money available for the

working capital a term used in cash flow statement a sum of money or other resources the principal or interest of which is set apart for a specific objective Vt to commit money in order to earn a financial return to make use of for future benefits or advantage vt The word has a variety of meanings but the sense in which it is employed must be gathered from the context It is not a legal term with a settled meaning but it is a term in common use suggesting money in common speech although technically it may be employed to cover other articles of value for the term fund or funds is generic and all embracing as compared with the term money etc which is specific In the plural specie or a stock of convertible wealth and funds may mean or include not only money as the term is generally understood but other circulating medium or instrument or tokens in general use in the commercial world as the representatives of value such as bank notes bills cheques drafts notes stocks and bonds deposits or certificates of deposit evidences of money lent to the Government constituting a national debt for which interest is paid at prescribed intervals Corpus Jurisdiction Secundum Vol The word has a variety of meanings but the sense in which it is employed must be gathered from the context It is not a legal term with a settled meaning but it is a term in common use suggesting money in common speech although technically it may be employed to cover other articles of value for the term fund or funds is generic and all embracing as compared with the term money etc which is specific in the plural capital cash money or moneys money and negotiable paper immediately or readily convertible into cash available pecuniary resources money in hand or available for the payment of a debt

in the commercial world as the representatives of value such as bank notes bills cheques drafts notes stocks and bonds deposits or certificates of deposit evidences of money lent to the Government constituting a national debt for which interest is paid at prescribed intervals The expression fund or funds has a variety of meanings but the sense in which it is employed must be gathered from the context In other words we must not construe that provision mechanically We must construe it having regard to the object which the <ORG> had in view in enacting it and in the context of the setting in which it occurs On a plain reading of that provision it is clear that clause of sub section of Section covers investment of the trust funds in any concern in which any of the persons specified in sub section have substantial interest specified persons in short and if such investment of the trust funds is made after December it would result in forfeiture of exemption from tax However if the trust funds have already been invested in any concern as aforesaid before January exemption would be forfeited if the funds continued to remain so invested even after December The object of the above provision is to discourage investment of trust funds in the concerns in which specified persons have substantial interest and if an investment is already made in such concerns to discourage continuance thereof after December In order to attract the provisions of Section what is essential is that the funds of the trust are invested in a concern covered by Section and if such investment is made prior to January funds are continued to be not invested after December Therefore in order to attract Section it has to be established that the funds of the trust which are capable of being invested have been utilised for making investment as provided therein When the funds of the trust are so invested and such investment is continued after December the trust whose funds are so invested will not be entitled to claim exemption under Section The word investment means to lay out money in business with a view to obtain income or profit In order to constitute an investment the amount laid down should be capable of resulting in an income or return or profit to the investor and in every case of investment the intention and positive act on the part of the investor should be to earn such income return or profit to the investor In order to constitute an investment the money shall be laid out in such manner as to acquire some species of property which bring in an income to the investor An investment popularly means every application of money which is intended to fetch return by way of interest income or profit This only employed as capital in a business is money invested in business It was observed that it would be doing violence to the plain language of the provision The interpretation suggested by learned counsel for <ORG> would do violence to the plain language used There is no room for any intendment There is no equity about a tax There is no presumption as to a tax One can only look fairly at the language used The position has been reiterated time and again by <ORG> As indicated above several High Courts have taken the view expressed by <ORG> in <ORG> case supra Accordingly we answer the question referred in the affirmative in favor of the assessed and against revenue
