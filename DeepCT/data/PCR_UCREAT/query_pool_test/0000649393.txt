of the Constitution had been violated inasmuch as he had a right to be equally treated with the <ORG> Servants similarly situated Held that under the provisions of Rule of the Fundamental Rules it is a matter of discretion with the local Government whether it will grant dearness allowance to any Government servant and if so how much It imposes no duty on the <ORG> to grant it and therefore no mandamus can issue to compel the <ORG> to grant it nor can any other writ or direction be issued in respect of it as there is no right in the Government servant which is capable of being protected or enforced Nor does it contemplate a law of the <ORG> or of the <ORG> dealing with similar subjects being held to be unconstitutional by a process of comparative study of the provisions of two enactments The sources of authority for the two statutes being different Article can have no application Consequent on the war there was a phenomenal rise in the price of foodstuffs and of other essential commodities and among the persons worst hit by it were the Government servants This difference in the result between the two scales not unnaturally caused considerable dissatisfaction among the employees concerned and after unsuccessful attempts to get redress on the executive side they filed through their representative the respondent the present application under article of the Constitution In the petition it was alleged that the <ORG> should have uniformly adopted the <ORG> rates for all its servants and the discrimination in making the two fold slab and accepting the <ORG> rates for one slab i for servants receiving salary over Rs is highly discri minatory that the <ORG> servant has a right to be treated equally with the <ORG> servant similarly situated and that every servant has these fundamental and natural rights and the petitioner and the members of <ORG> have a right to demand from the respondent the Dearness Allowance at the <ORG> rates The petitioner then prayed That declaring that all ministerial servants are entitled to the <ORG> rates of Dearness Allowance or in any case adequate Dearness Allowance <ORG> should be directed by a writ of mandamus or by any other suitable writ or direction to cancel the discriminatory rules of Dearness Allowance and adopt the <ORG> rates to all servants without discrimination or in any case to provide with adequate rates of Dearness Allowance sufficient to provide reasonable subsistence for them It is against this judgment that the present appeal has been preferred by <ORG> on a certificate granted under article of the Constitution It is argued on behalf of the appellant firstly that grant of dearness allowance is a matter ex gratia and not justiciable and that neither a writ of mandamus nor any direction could be issued with reference thereto and secondly that the Resolution dated th September is not hit by article of the Constitution In our opinion both these contention are well founded On the first question Rule of the Fundamental Rules runs as follow Subject to any restrictions which the Secretary of State in Council may by order impose upon the powers of the Governor General in Council or the Governor in Council as the case may be and to the general rule that the amount of a compensatory allowance should be so regulated that the allowance is not on the whole a source of profit to the recipient a Local Government may grant such allowance to any Government servant under its control and may make rules prescribing their amounts and the conditions under which they may be drawn That being so the prayer for mandamus is clearly misconceived as that could be granted only when there is in the applicant a right to compel the performance of some duty cast on the opponent Rule of the Fundamental Rules confers no right on the Government servants to the grant of dearness allowance it imposes no duty on the <ORG> to grant it It merely confers a power on the <ORG> to grant compassionate allowance at its own discretion and no mandamus can issue to compel the exercise of such a power Nor indeed could any other writ or direction be issued in respect of it as there is no right in the applicant which is capable of being protected or enforced The position is thus stated in Halsbury Laws of England Volume IX page Note It is erroneous to suppose that a petition of right will lie for matters which are of grace and not of right In the result we must hold that the matters raised in the petition are not justiciable Mr <NAME> the learned counsel for the respondent did not dispute the correctness of this position But he argued that when once the Government passed a Resolution fixing a scale of allowance under Rule that would be law as defined in article a of the Constitution and if that law infringed article it could be declared void Now the scheme which has been adopted in the impugned Resolution is firstly that dearness allowance if to I be paid to the employees on a scale graded according to pay different rates being adopted for different slabs and there being a progressive reduction These being the features of the scheme there can be no room for the contention that it has made any discrimination Mr <NAME> does not contend that there is anything in the scheme or in the Resolution adopting it which bring it within the prohibition enacted in article We do not find anything in article which supports this somewhat startling contention Article defines the <ORG> as including the <ORG> and the <ORG> of each of the <ORG> Article enacts that the <ORG> shall not make any laws taking away or abridging the rights conferred by Part III and article enacts that The <ORG> shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India If it decides that it does it has to declare it void if it decides that it does not it has to uphold it The power of the <ORG> to declare a law void under article has to be exercised with reference to the specific legislation which is impugned Nor does it contemplate a law of the <ORG> or of the <ORG> dealing with similar subjects being held to be unconstitutional by a process of comparative study of the provisions of the two enactments The sources of authority for the two statutes being different article can have no application It was argued on behalf of the appellant that the assumption underlying the argument of the respondent with reference to article that the <ORG> had adopted the Report of the <ORG> in part and rejected it in part was itself without foundation In the view we have taken on the applicability of article this question has no practical importance but as all the materials have been placed before us we may briefly express our opinion thereon In paragraph they further observed that in fixing the scale on the basis of the cost of living index the element of pay had also been taken into account but that as they had revised the scale of basic pay they were not including it in fixing the dearness allowance In paragraph they observed that unlike the <ORG> they were taking into consideration the financial resources of the <ORG> in fixing the scale Mr <NAME> also referred us to two Resolutions of the appellant dated th January and th October adopting the scale fixed by the <ORG> in respect of certain other categories That has no bearing on the question whether the <ORG> whose recommendations were approved by the <ORG> had adopted in part the Report of the <ORG> so as to result in discrimination The facts stated above show that the <ORG> went into the matter independently and viewed the question from a different standpoint and in formulating the scheme which they did they did not adopt the Report of the <ORG> though they derived considerable assistance from it In the result this appeal must be allowed and the petition of the respondent dismissed but in the circumstances there will be no order as to costs either here or in the <ORG> below
