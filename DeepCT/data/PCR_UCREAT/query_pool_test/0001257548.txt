State filed an appeal challenging the acquittal and the convicted persons filed another appeal Sentence of imprisonment for life was awarded to all the convicts We have before us two appeals by special leave one jointly filed by <NAME> and <NAME> and the other separately filed by <NAME> After trial learned sessions Judge concluded that prosecution has failed to prove that there was an unlawful assembly but found that <NAME> first accused and <NAME> second accused have inflicted cut injuries or the deceased with Dhariyas and convicted them under Section and sentenced them each to imprisonment for life Out of the four eye witnesses examined by the prosecution <NAME> PW did not support the case and the other three witnesses spoke to the prosecution version Learned sessions Judge found the evidence of <NAME> PW quits acceptable and hence the conviction was based on his testimony <ORG> on a re evaluation of the evidences felt that the trial court to have placed reliance on the testimony of <NAME> PW and <NAME> PW also Learned judges expressed the view that sessions judge has given undue importance to certain discrepancies and contradictions noted in their evidence <ORG> found that there was no unlawful assembly as the strength of the assembly was insufficient to constitute it into unlawful assembly Where this court observed at para thus Sections and of the Indian Penal Code provide for criminal liability viewed from different angles as regards actual participants accessories and men actuated by a common object or a common intention and the charge is a rolled up one involving the direct liability and the constructive liability without specifying who are directly liable and who are sought to be made constructively liable In such a situation the absence of a charge under one or other of the various heads of criminal liability for the offence cannot be said to be fatal by itself and before a conviction for the substantive offence without a charge can be set aside prejudice will have to be made put In most of the cases of this kind evidence is normally given from the outset as to who was primarily responsible for the act which brought about the offence and such evidence is of course relevant The first submission of the learned counsel for the appellant has no merit While dealing with the case of appellant <NAME> we may point out that <ORG> chose to believe the evidence of PW and PW and found that their evidence supports the testimony of PW who said that <NAME> was also a participant in the crime When cross examined PW was asked this omission and he had no explanation to offer No doubt <ORG> has full power to review the evidence and to arrive at its own independent conclusion whether the appeal is against conviction or acquittal But while dealing with an appeal against acquittal the appellate court has to bear in mind first that there is a general presumption in favour of the ignorance of the person accused in criminal cases that presumption is only strengthened by the acquittal The second is every accused is entitled to the benefit of reasonable doubt regarding his guilt and when the trial court acquitted him He would retain that benefit in the appellate court also Thus appellate court in appeals against acquittals has to proceed more cautiously and only if there is absolute assurance of the guilt of the accused upon the evidence on record that the order of acquittal is liable to the interfered with or disturbed Trial court which relied on the evidence of <NAME> PW pointed out that the witness did not refer to any role played by <NAME> when he gave statement to the police during investigation and hence a conviction for the offence of murder cannot be passed against <NAME> on the strength of improvement made at the trial We have scrutinized the evidence and we too are satisfied that PW <NAME> has in fact omitted to mention anything about <NAME> when PW was questioned by police and has later on tried to give an improved version We are therefore of the opinion that the order of acquittal passed by the trial court in favour of <NAME> should have been maintained by <ORG> We agree with the findings recorded by the courts below and are of the opinion that their conviction and sentence are well merited There is no merit in their appeal We set aside the conviction and sentence passed on <NAME> and restore the order or acquittal passed by <ORG> in his favour
