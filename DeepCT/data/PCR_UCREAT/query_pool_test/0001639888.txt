This order shall govern the disposal of No of <ORG> and <NAME> and No During the pendency of this petition the petitioners in No of started the manufacture of the same product which was the subject matter of the earlier petition Then the Assistant Collector <ORG> Indore issued a notice of show cause to the petitioner Company as to why the product be not classified as a confectionery Hence a writ petition was filed by the petitioner seeking the issuance of a writ restraining the Assistant Collector <ORG> and the Superintendent <ORG> Indore from taking any further action on the show cause notices Annexures and being illegal and without jurisdiction As the main petition which was pending before this Court is No of the facts leading to this petition may be briefly stated The petitioner <ORG> manufactures an Ayurvedic product at their factory at Niran janpur As a part of their preparation they manufacture a product called SWAD tablets As such after making due enquiry the classification was approved by the letter dated vide Annexure The petitioner filed reply to the said letter vide Annexure Thereafter the Inspector of <ORG> Range took the sugar syrup and the SWAD tablet for test on and respectively vide Annexures and The Collector <ORG> respondent No issued a show cause notice under Section A of the <ORG> Act to the petitioner firm to show cause why the SWAD tablet be not classified under sub heading relating to sugar confectionery instead of sub heading relating to pharmaceutical products and why an amount of over one crore be not recovered under Rule of the <ORG> Rules read with Section A of the <ORG>s and Salt Act and why penalty under Rules A and of <ORG> Rules be not imposed for contravention of the said Rules The notice is Annexure which is challenged in this petition on various grounds Firstly it has been contended by the petitioners that the classification list was finally approved on after due enquiry under sub rule of Rule Secondly it has been stated that the classification list once approved finally cannot be received because the approval of the classification is a quasi judicial function and there is no power of review under the Act Thirdly it has been stated that Section A applies to recovery of duty not paid not levied or short paid short levied and not to change a classification list It has also been stated that in many medical syrups which are known and treated as medicines the glucose base is over per cent and still they are treated as medicines It has also been stated that the show cause notice is barred by limitation as Annexure to Annexure clearly show that there was full disclosure of all the facts by the petitioners It has also been submitted that the Collector has already made up his mind in respect of changing the classification of the product and therefore the notice is biased The petition was resisted on the ground that the petitioners have used liquid glucose in the manufacture of their product SWAD from the very beginning but there is no mention of this in the ingredients either in their said drug licence or on the wrapper of the product As such the preparation is against the very book of Ayurvedic system which was followed by the notices In any case this is not the stage wherein the <ORG> should adjudicate on the validity of the notice because the petitioner has a chance to show cause before the <ORG> No of has also been opposed on the aforesaid grounds and it has been stated by the respondents in that petition that they have filed detailed replies in No of and those facts may be treated as reply in this petition also along with the annexures In reply to the rejoinder the respondents submitted that the show cause notice is legal because the Collector is the proper officer to modify the classification list and it could be so modified in view of the fresh facts being brought on record A reply to the rejoinder was filed by the respondents wherein the order of the Drug Controller dated was challenged by <ORG> being faulty erroneous biased and void abinitio The petitioner gave further clarification on wherein it has been stated that Dr <NAME> is an Expert under the Rules framed under the Cosmetics Act and the respondents have no jurisdiction to criticise the order of the Drug Controller In view of the aforesaid contention of both the parties the first and crucial point which arises for determination is whether the tablet SWAD can be classified as an Ayurvedic medicine or a confectionery For answering this question various other aspects and the provisions of the Act and the authorities cited by the parties have to be taken into consideration However before considering the respective arguments of the parties on this crucial issue on merits let us first examine whether the petitioner could approach this Court on the show cause notice itself We may refer to the latest <ORG> authority wherein it has been held that although an alternative remedy may be available for challenging the impugned order by referring the question under the statutory provision to the appropriate authority but it is well established that an alternative remedy is not an absolute bar to the maintainability of a writ petition When an authority has acted wholly without jurisdiction <ORG> should not refuse to exercise its jurisdiction under Article of the Constitution on the ground of existence of an alternative remedy This rule requiring the exhaustion of statutory remedies before the writ will be granted is a rule of policy convenience and discretion rather than a rule of law In the same case it is also held that if an inferior <ORG> or <ORG> of first instance acts wholly without jurisdiction or patently in excess of jurisdiction or manifestly conducts proceedings before it in a manner contrary to rules of natural justice and accepted rules of procedure and which offends superior <ORG> sense of fair play the Superior <ORG> may exercise its powers to issue prerogative writ of certiorari to correct the error of the <ORG> or <ORG> of first instance even if an appeal to another inferior <ORG> or <ORG> was available This authority was referred to in <ORG> case supra and <ORG> case has been followed In <ORG> case supra and the same principle has been reiterated in Dr <NAME> case supra Now according to the petitioners <ORG> have issued the notices challenged in the two petitions without any jurisdiction and without any basis therefore they can approach this <ORG> directly The crucial point which falls for consideration is whether the product SWAD is an Ayurvedic preparation or a confectionery in view of the facts and circumstances of the case On the other hand it has been argued by the petitioner that the product SWAD was considered an Ayurvedic medicine on the basis of the Drug License No Therefore the respondent No gave a notice on to the petitioner stating that sugar syrup prepared during the course of manufacture is classifiable under sub heading A reply was given by the petitioner to this notice on that Sugar Syrup is not excisable The Drug Controller after holding the enquiry vide Annexure passed on order in favour of the petitioner discharging the notice wherein it held that the medicine is an Ayurvedic preparation despite the presence of liquid glucose and the variation in the weight and the ratio of the glucose and the active ingredient would not change the nature of the medicine <ORG> had no authority to challenge or criticise the order of <ORG> which is <ORG> and an Expert competent to give a finding on the nature of a drug for which a license for manufacture has been issued In the light of the above arguments let us first see the relevant judgments relied on the points raised before us supra <ORG> New Delhi has held that for any formulation to be considered as Ayurvedic medicine the same should be either recognised so in a standard Ayurvedic work or should be so proved by clinical trials or should be recognised so by an authority like <ORG> The appellant case for considering the goods described as Halls Icemint tablets as medicine is only based on one fact that active ingredients namely Pudina and Eucalyptus oil are Ayurvedic in nature and these have medicinal properties The certificate given by Dr <NAME> is not based on first hand information and besides being a Professor of Surgery of <ORG> he cannot be considered as a specialist in the field of medicine The certificate which could be taken note of is the one issued by the competent authority which in the instant case could only be the <ORG> In the aforesaid judgment the certificate of the socalled Expert Dr <NAME> was considered and it was found that the information was based on the opinion of Dr <NAME> but it was not clear before the <ORG> as to who this Dr <NAME> is and what information is supplied to Dr <NAME> As such the certificate is not based on the first hand information Therefore after considering all the facts and circumstances of the case and the contents of the product the <ORG> was of the view that the above said product could not be treated as an Ayurvedic medicine but can be classified as a sugar confectionery as it has a cooling and soothing effect on the throat as described in the literature But it is also a settled legal position that the said doctrine of commercial nomenclature and trade understanding should be departed from in a case where the statutory content in which the tariff entry appears requires such a departure Trade meaning or commercial nomenclature would be applicable if a particular product description occurs by itself in a tariff entry and there is no conflict between the tariff entry and any other entry requiring to reconcile and harmonise that tariff entry with any other entry In the same judgment <ORG> has held that although it is the settled position of law that the words used in Taxing Statute have to be understood in the common parlance or commercial parlance but such a trade understanding or commercial nomenclature can be given only in cases where the word in the Tariff Entry has not been used in a scientific or technical sense and where there is no conflict between the words used in the Tariff Entry and any other entry in the Tariff Schedule In the aforesaid case <ORG> took into consideration the various entry items and held that the calcareous stone as mentioned in ITC Schedule has to be taken in scientific and technical sense as therein the said stone has been described as of an apparent specific gravity of or more Therefore the word marble has to be interpreted in the scientific or technical sense and not in the sense commercially understood or as meant in the trade parlance But it is obvious that this trade understanding should be the understanding of those who are actually dealing with that particular product or goods The Drugs and Cosmetics Act is a comprehensive piece of legislation which deals with drugs and provides not only for the standards of quality misbranded and adulterated drugs but also for the safeguards for the manufacture sale and distribution of drugs as well as cosmetics The Act makes it abundantly clear that only those drugs which are manufactured under a valid licence issued under the Act and in compliance with its provisions can be lawfully sold exhibited for sale or distributed Therefore the true and real meaning which a drug has in the trade or in commerce is the meaning given to it in the Drugs and Cosmetics Act In this case <ORG> has also taken the view that the order of the Assessment Officer has to stand or fall on its own grounds and cannot be supplemented by affidavits There is not an iota of evidence to show that this product is sold as a confectionery and is commonly used as a confectionery by the consumers In Tariff Entry the medicaments including those in Ayurvedic Unani Sidh and Homoeopathy system have been mentioned as the goods falling within that entry The formula so prepared with the aid of the aforesaid text books was patented and an application to <ORG> for obtaining the license for manufacture of this drug was made which was granted to them Now the objection of <ORG> is that firstly the liquid glucose which is used in the medicine is not an Ayurvedic ingredient and nowhere mentioned in the Ayurvedic book of medicines and the contents of the so called curative medicines is only per cent whereas the percentage of glucose per cent It has further been stated that there is deviation in the weight proportion of the active ingredients of the product and the liquid glucose has taken the product out of the purview of medicine There is absence of dosage in the wrapper In the instant case a further development has taken place wherein <ORG> had made a complaint to the Drug Controller that the license has been wrongly issued on the grounds which have been enumerated in the show cause notice Therefore a show cause notice was issued under Section a of the Cosmetics Act and the Rules by the Drug Controller to the petitioner and a copy of the test laboratory report was also sent with the show cause notice The liquid glucose is used as preservative and binding agent like other medicines just to preserve the properties of the drug and in general practise there is no need to mention about the preservatives and binding agents A letter of the Director Indigenous System of Medicines Dr <NAME> dated was also produced which says that liquid glucose is commonly used as preservative and binding agent and its presence has no effect on the active ingredient and the further opinion of the Expert that despite the presence of liquid glucose the character of the drug shall remain Ayurvedic has also been considered by the Drug Controller As such the fact that the Drug Controller agreeing with the opinion of the two Experts has reiterated its earlier finding while issuing the licence of manufacture that the product SWAD is an Ayurvedic product supports the case of the petitioner and the aforesaid fact cannot be brushed aside simply because the assessment has to be made independently in accordance with the Central Tariff As such as held by <ORG> <ORG> and <ORG> in the aforementioned cases the Court has to resort to the provisions of the Cosmetics Act for ascertaining the nature of the product and when the experts in the field is available It cannot be brushed aside lightly only because there is an averment that it is a confectionery The deviations in the preparation as pointed out by <ORG> were dealt with and considered by <ORG> Government of and there is no contrary opinion of any Ayurvedic Expert to hold that the product is simply a confectionery and not a Ayurvedic product Even in <ORG> case supra decided by the <ORG> on which much reliance is placed by the learned counsel for <ORG> the <ORG> has considered the Expert opinion and thereafter gave a finding that the expert opinion is of no avail to the manufacture in that case because the opinion of Dr <NAME> was a second hand information and the qualifications of Dr <NAME> were also not known to ascertain whether he was an Expert or not coupled with the fact that there was no clinical test of the product It has already been held above that there is no evidence on record that in common parlance the product is known as a confectionery Food and Drugs in favour of the petitioner discharging the notice issued to them have filed a rejoinder wherein it has been stated that the opinion of the Director is erroneous and should not be acted upon Much emphasis has been laid that according to the definition of Ayurvedic preparation there is a clear interdict on the use of any ingredient than the one shown in the text and that is why the word only has been used in the definition It is manifest that the word only has been used in respect of the ingredients of the product and the preservative items in a particular product cannot be treated as active ingredients The classification was done on the basis of the license issued by the Controller of Drugs Govt The notice Annexure in No of is therefore without jurisdiction and as such this <ORG> could very well entertain a petition in a case where the notice is without jurisdiction The notices issued in the aforesaid petitions are quashed
