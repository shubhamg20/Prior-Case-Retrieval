Vs RESPONDENT DELHI DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY OTHERS DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH <NAME> A BENCH <NAME> A KRISHNAIYER CITATION AIR SCR SCC ACT Constitution of India Articles Delhi Development <ORG> Act <ORG> constructing flats and selling them to public Levy and collection of surcharge as price of flat in addition to the construction cost <ORG> to work on no profit no loss basis Such surcharge Whether illegal Discriminatory The authority undertakes constructions of dwelling units for people belonging to different income groups styled as Middle Income Low Income <ORG> and <ORG> Some of the petitioners got themselves registered with the authority in accordance with the terms and conditions laid down by it for allotment of flats in deposits as required by the terms and conditions for <ORG> Scheme at Lawrence Road Prasad Nagar and Rajouri Garden and made the initial deposit The number of available flats being less in each scheme compared to the number of applicants registered lots were drawn and the petitioners were informed that each of them should deposit the amount mentioned in the letter of allotment The Petitioners paid the amount as intimated and consequently a flat was allotted to each of them and they entered into possession It was con tended on their behalf that i The treatment meted by the <ORG> is discriminatory inasmuch as no surcharge was levied on flats in <ORG> schemes constructed and allotted prior to November and after January ii As the authority formulates income wise area wise schemes for constructing flats there should be only income wise classification wholly ignoring area and time factor for classification iii Levying of surcharge runs counter to the object for which the authority was set up namely to make available housing accommodation on no profit no loss basis iv Surcharge is arbitrary inasmuch as how the surcharge is worked out in each case does not conform to any rational tangible scientific or understandable formula The Vice Chairman had no authority to levy surcharge and that even if he has authorised the same it runs counter to the principle of fixing disposal price incorporated in resolution No dated November vi Even if the Vice Chairman had such power there is nothing to show that he has exercised this power and given direction for adding the surcharge to the disposal price and that therefore the levy of surcharge is unauthorised and vii that the authority has made a huge profit by levy of surcharge The respondents raised a preliminary objection that the petitions were not maintainable under Article of the Constitution inasmuch as the petitioners have not come to the <ORG> them under Part III of the Constitution but that the petitioners have invoked the jurisdiction of the <ORG> for the relief of reopening concluded contracts and that if the court accepts the contentions the petitioners would derive an unfair advantage over others who may not have applied for flats because of the price set out in the brochure and if surcharge is excluded they may have applied for Flats at a lower price cannot conceal the real purpose motivating the petitions namely to get back a part of the purchase price of flats paid by the petitioners with wide open eyes after flats have been securely obtained The authority is under no obligation to fix price of different flats in different schemes albeit in the same income group at the same level or by any particular statutory or binding formula Those who opt to take flats in a particular income wise area wise scheme in which all flats came up together as one project may form a class and any discriminatory treatment In the same class may attract Art In price fixation executive has a wide discretion and is only answerable provided there is any statutory control over its policy of price fixation and it is not the function of the <ORG> to sit in judgment over such matters of economic policy as must be necessarily left to the Government of the day to decide The only valid basis for classification would be income wise area wise time wise scheme wise meaning all flats constructed at or about the same time in same area in one project for particular income group will form a class and there is no discrimination amongst them If the <ORG> was set up for making available dwelling units at reasonable prices to persons belonging to different groups it would not be precluded from devising its own price formula for different income groups It is a well recognised policy underlying tax law that the State has a wide discretion in selecting the persons or objects it will tax and that the statute is not open to attack on the ground that it taxes some persons or objects and not others It is only when within the range of its selection the law operates unequally and this cannot be justified on the basis of a valid classification that there would be a violation of Art The revised estimate showed the disposal price of each flat as Rs It takes note of the delegation of powers to fix disposal and hire purchase price of flats to the Vice Chairman and further provides that if there is a marginal saving in any scheme the amount be diverted to subsidies cost of <ORG> and <ORG> houses The Resolution No of the <ORG> read with Resolution No of <ORG> sets out clearly that the power to fix the disposal price was delegated to the Vice Chairman and ordinarily such excessive delegation to one man may be galling to a judicial body yet the scheme of regulations and the provisions contained in Regulation read with Section clearly envisages such delegation of powers The contention that the <ORG> has made a huge profit by levy of surcharge is without merits A ORIGINAL JURISDICTION Writ Petitions Nos Under Article of the Constitution Both the petitions raise identical contentions and i was said that Writ Petition No of is more comprehensive in character and therefore the facts alleged therein may be taken as representative character The Act was enacted to provide for the development of Delhi according to plan and for matters ancillary thereto and for carrying out the objects underlying the Act the <ORG> has prepared Master and Zonal development plans for Delhi With a view to easing the acute housing problems in the capital city the <ORG> undertakes construction of dwelling units for people belonging to different income groups styled as <ORG> MIG for short <ORG> LIG for short <ORG> and <ORG> <ORG> for short Some of the petitioners got themselves registered with the authority in accordance with the terms and conditions laid down by it and made the initial deposits as required by the terms and conditions Petitioners had applied and got themselves registered for allotment of flats in MIG scheme situated at Lawrence Road As the number of available flats in this scheme were less than the number of allottees registered lots were drawn and the petitioners were informed that they have been allotted flats and that each of them should deposit the amount mentioned in the letter of allotment It appears that the petitioners paid the amount they were called upon to pay and a flat was allotted to each of them and they have entered into possession It is further alleged that the <ORG> has not levied and collected such surcharge from other A allottees of flats in some other MIG Schemes and that this action of levying and collecting surcharge is violative of Art inasmuch as persons belonging to the same class namely allottees of flats in MIG Scheme have been unequally treated It is also alleged that there was no valid or understandable justification of levying and collecting surcharge as price of flats comprised in MIG Schemes between and and that from May this unauthorised surcharge has been abolished The petitioners therefore prayed for issue of a writ or order or direction declaring the levy of surcharge as illegal and unconstitutional and for a direction for refund thereof together with the interest at the rate of per annum from the date of levy and collection till the date of refund It envisages the setting up of an <ORG> to be styled as Delhi Development <ORG> which would be a body corporate by the name aforesaid having perpetual succession and a common seal with power acquire hold and dispose of property both movable and immovable and to contract and shall by the said name sue and be sued Section contemplates the constitution of <ORG> for the purpose of advising the <ORG> on the preparation of the master plan and on such matters relating to the planning of development or arising out of or in connection with the administration of the Act Section A which was added by amending Act of confers power on the <ORG> to constitute as many committees consisting wholly of members or wholly of other persons or partly of members and partly of other persons and for such purpose or purposes as it may think fit Chapter confers power on <ORG> to acquire land for the purposes of development or for any other purpose under the Act under the provisions to the Land Acquisition Act and further authorises <ORG> to transfer the land so acquired to he <ORG> Section confers power on the <ORG> to delegate any power exercisable by it under the Act except the power to make regulations on such officer or local authority or committee constitued under A as may be mentioned by a notification to be published in the Official Gazette in such cases and subject to such conditions if any as may be specified therein One more section of which notice should be taken is which confers power on the <ORG> with the previous approval of <ORG> by notification in the official Gazette to make regulations consistent with the Act and the rules made thereunder to carry out the purposes of this Act sub may be made by <ORG> and any regulation so made may be altered or rescinded by the <ORG> in exercise of its powers under sub Section makes it obligatory to lay every rule and regulation made under this Act before <ORG> in session for a period of days and subject to any alteration or modification therein the rule or regulation shall after expiry of the prescribed period mentioned have effect only in such modified form or be of no effect as the case may be so however that any such modification or annulment shall be without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under the rule or regulation The petitioners contend that levy of surcharge has no nexus to the object for which the <ORG> was set up namely providing housing accommodation at reasonable price by the <ORG> whose declared policy is no profit no loss It was said on behalf of the petitioners that even if the <ORG> was set up for providing housing accommodation to the people in different income groups keeping in view their financial capacity affordability yet a statutory body like the <ORG> operating on no profit no loss basis must have a scientifically prescribed formula for working out its price structure and that must be uniformly applied to all those who apply for flats and to whom they are allotted and such a statutory <ORG> cannot discriminate in working out the disposal price of the flats by including surcharge in respect of some <ORG> schemes within a certain specified period a surcharge not authorised by law and not sanctioned by the <ORG> as a component of price and unknown to pricing of flats while others similarly situated and similarly circumstanced and belonging to the same income group enjoyed the benefit cf getting flats at cost price and therefore petitioners have been accorded discriminatory treatment in the matter of price of flats allotted to them Petitioners therefore contend that even if they applied for flats anc got registered and were offered flats and accepted the same at the price stated in the brochure and even if it has resulted in a concluded contract yet the <ORG> should not turn a blind eye to such gross discrimination by a statutory authority charged with a duty to provide housing accommodation acting on the declared policy of no profit no loss of the Constitution inasmuch as The petitioners have not come to the <ORG> for enforcement of a fundamental right conferred upon the petitioners under Part III of the Constitution but the petitioners have invoked jurisdiction of this <ORG> for a relief of re opening concluded contracts It was also submitted that if the <ORG> accepts the contention of the petitioners they would derive an unfair advantage over others who may not have applied for flats because of the price set out in the brochure and if surcharge is excluded they may have applied for flats at a lower price and there fore also the <ORG> should not entertain the petitions Though we are not inclined to reject the petitions on this preliminary objection as we have heard them on merits it is undeniable that camouflage of Art cannot conceal the real purpose motivating these petitions namely to get back a part of the purchase price of flats paid by the petitioners with wide open eyes after flats have been securely obtained and petition to this <ORG> under Art The undisputed facts are that petitioners offered themselves for registration for allotment of flats that may be constructed by the <ORG> scheme It also reserved the right to surrender or cancel the registration the mode and method of paying the price and handing over the possession They offered to purchase the flats at the price on which the <ORG> offered to sell the same There is no suggestion that there was a mis statement or incorrect statement or any fraudulent concealment in the information supplied in the brochure published by the <ORG> on the strength of which they applied and obtained flats There is no obligation on the purchaser to purchase the flat at the price offered Even if there may be any merit in this contention though there is none such a relief of refund cannot be the subject matter of a petition under Art Conceding for this submission that the <ORG> has the trappings of a <ORG> or would be comprehended in other authority for the purpose of Art while determining price of flats constructed by it it acts purely in its executive capacity and is bound by the obligations which dealings of the <ORG> with the individual citizens import into every transacting entered into the exercise of its constitutional powers But after the <ORG> or its agents have entered into the field of ordinary contract the relations are no longer governed by the Constitutional provisions but by the legally valid contract which determines rights and obligations of the parties inter se or of any other constitutional provision when the <ORG> or its agents purporting to act within this field perform any act In this sphere they can only claim rights conferred upon them by contract and are bound by the Petitioners were under no obligation to seek allotment of flats even after they had registered themselves They looked at the price and flats and applied for the flats Each one of them was allotted a flat and he paid the price voluntarily They are now trying to wriggle out by an invidious method so as to get back a part of the purchase price not offering to return the benefit under the contract namely surrender of flat possession of the flat is taken and price is paid At a later stage when they are secure in possession with title petitioners are trying to get back a part of the purchase price and thus trying to re open and wriggle out of a concluded contract only partially <ORG> has observed that those who contract with open eyes must accept the burdens of the contract along with its benefits Reciprocal rights and obligations arising out of contract do not depend for their enforceability upon whether a contracting party finds it prudent to abide by the terms of the contract By such a test no contract would ever have a binding force However as the petitions were heard on merits the contentions canvassed on behalf of the petitioners may as well be examined The principal contention canvassed on behalf of the petitioners is that the treatment meted to them by the <ORG> is discriminatory inasmuch as no surcharge was levied on flats in <ORG> scheme constructed and allotted prior to November and after January There is one more <ORG> scheme at Munirka where the allotment took place at or about the same time but in which case no surcharge was levied those in the same income bracket form one class even for the purpose of determining disposal price of flat allotable to them irrespective of situation location or other relevant determinants which enter into price calculation and therefore in the same income group there cannot be differentiation by levying of surcharge in some cases and charging only the cost price in other cases and that the discrimination is thus writ large on the face of the record because by levying surcharge in case of petitioners they have been treated unequally and with an evil eye When the flats were offered to the petitioners the price in round figure in respect of each flat was mentioned and surcharge was not separately set out and this price has been accepted by the petitioners The obligation that regulations are binding on the <ORG> and have provided for a statutory price fixation formula on no profit no loss basis will be presently examined but save this the <ORG> is under no obligation to fix price of different flats in differed Those who opt to take flats in a particular income wise area wise scheme in which all flats came up together as one project may form a class and any discriminatory treatment in the same class may attract Art In price fixation executive has a wide discretion and is only answerable provided there is any statutory control over its policy of price fixation and it is not the function of the <ORG> to sit in judgment over such matters of economic policy as must be necessarily left to the Government of the day to decide The experts alone can work out the mechanics of price determination <ORG> can certainly not be expected to decide without the assistance of the experts See <ORG> and <ORG> <ORG> In the leading judgment it has been observed that mechanics of price fixation have necessarily to be left to the executive and unless it is patent that there is hostile discrimination against a class the processual basis of price fixation has to be accepted in the generality of cases as valid What is forbidden by Art is discrimination amongst persons of the same class and for the purposes of allotment of flats scheme wise allottees of flats in the same scheme not different schemes in the same income bracket will have to be treated as a class and unless in each such class there is unequal treatment or unreasonable or arbitrary treatment the complaint that Art <NAME> speaking for the <ORG> observed as under A reasonable classification is one which includes all who are similarly situated and none who are not The question then is what does the phrase similarly situated mean The answer to the question is that we must look beyond the classification to the purpose of the law A reasonable classification is one which includes all persons who are similarly situated with respect to the purpose of the law And there is no discrimination amongst them It is a well recognised policy underlying tax law that the <ORG> has wide discretion in selecting the persons or objects it will tax and that the statute is not open to attack on the ground that it taxes some persons or objects and not others It is only when within the range of its selection the law operates unequally and this cannot be justified on the basis of a valid classification that there would be a violation of Art The argument proceeds on the assumption that the principle of no profit no loss implies that in respect of each flat the cost of its construction must be worked out and that alone can be the disposal price of each flat The regulations styled as the Delhi Development <ORG> Management and Disposal of Housing Estates Regulations Regulations for short are framed in exercise of the powers conferred by and were laid before <ORG> as required by Regulations however on the contrary indicate that the power to determine the disposal price is vested in the <ORG> and as price has been fixed by the delegate of the <ORG> even if it is inclusive of surcharge it cannot be said that it runs counter to the declared policy of the <ORG> It is at this stage necessary to examine the contention that in the case of Wazirpur and Munirka LIG schemes which came up during this very period no surcharge was levied and therefore there is invidious discrimination amongst members of the same class per plinth area per metre whereas in respect of Lawrence Road it came to Rs It is pointed out in affidavit in reply that those flats were handed over to <ORG> for meeting their needs for staff quarters and that was done in the year It is also pointed out that the Government charged half the price of the land in respect of these flats and therefore surcharge was not levied There is two fold fallacy in this submission The next contention is that Vice Chairman had no authority to levy surcharge and that even if he has authorised the same it runs counter to the principle of fixing disposal price incorporated in Resolution No dated November These regulations shall be administered by the Vice Chairman subject to general guidance and resolutions of the <ORG> who may delegate his powers to any officer of the <ORG> But the more objectionable part of Resolution No is that such <ORG> which is to enjoy all powers and functions of the <ORG> was to be constituted by the Chairman at his sole discretion because he was authorised not only to constitute the <ORG> but to determine organisational set up and then make all efforts for implementing the housing and allied schemes Though Mr <NAME> did challenge the validity of Resolution No Mr <NAME> in cognate petition refrained from doing so It takes note of the delegation of powers to fix disposal and hire purchase price of flats to the Vice Chairman and further provides that if there is a marginal saving in any scheme the amount is always diverted to subsidies cost of <ORG> and <ORG> houses The Resolution No of the <ORG> with Resolution No of the <ORG> sets out clearly that the power to fix the disposal price was delegated to the Vice Chairman and ordinarily such excessive delegation to one man may be galling to a judicial body yet the scheme of regulations and the provisions contained in Regulation read with clearly envisages such delegation of powers It is therefore idle to contend that the Vice Chairman had no authority to levy the surcharge as component of disposal price of flats It was next contended that even if Vice Chairman had such power there is nothing to show that he has exercised this power and that therefore somewhere without any authority someone has added the surcharge to the disposal price and that therefore the levy of surcharge is unauthorised The last contention is that the <ORG> has made a huge profit by levy of surcharge In this connection statistical table was annexed to the petition and there was serious controversy about the facts and figures set out therein by the other side Therefore there is no substance in the contention that the <ORG> has made a huge profit These were all the contentions in these petitions and as there is no Merit in any of them the petitions are dismissed
