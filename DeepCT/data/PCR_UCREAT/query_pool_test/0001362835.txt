This appeal raises a question of subrogation The facts necessary for the disposal of the same lie in a narrow compass on a mortgage dated rd October executed by defendants to and their father late <NAME> in her favour There was a prior mortgage on the said property dated st August They therefore claim a right of subrogation in respect of the said sum on the ground that by their having discharged the said decree debt they are subrogated to the rights of the mortgagee under the deed dated st August The learned Subordinate Judge refused to give them the said relief on the ground that there is no registered instrument reserving the right as required by Section iii of the Transfer of Property Act It is this view that is now canvassed in this appeal by Mr <NAME> on their behalf It is conceded that the matter is governed by Section of the Transfer of Property Act but it is contended that defendants and have a right of subrogation under Clause i of the said section at But it is contended that the observations regarding the interpretation of that section are obiter and that a different note was struck in a recent judgment by their Lordships <NAME> and <NAME> JJ at I observed as follows The first clause enunciates no new principle vide Section of the Transfer of Property Act since repealed It applies to all persons who have an interest in the equity of redemption and are under no personal obligation to discharge prior encumbrances The third clause has been enacted to confer a benefit on persons who advance money to discharge an incumbrance only if the mortgagee has by a registered instrument agreed that such persons shall be subrogated The clause is intended to apply to all persons who acquire an interest in the mortgaged property by advancing moneys to discharge prior incumbrances and there is no warrant for restricting the scope of that clause to persons other than purchasers or mortgagees as contended by Mr <NAME> The distinction between the two classes of cases aforesaid namely those who have an existing interest in the property and those who acquire an interest therein by advancing money is well recognised in the law relating to subrogation Since the date of this decision the matter was considered by a Full Bench of <ORG> and a Full Bench of <ORG> In that case certain properties were sold for discharging the prior encumbrances and as there was no registered instrument in the case the right of subrogation was refused The actual decision in that case is that A purchaser of a property with whom is left part of the consideration of the sale in his favour for paying off a mortgage but in whose favour there is no express agreement of subrogation in writing registered is not entitled to claim subrogation against a later mortgagee under Section of the Transfer of Property Act as amended by Act XX of It also affirms the view taken by us in our <ORG> decision observed thus There is a well established distinction between cases in which a person who has a pre existing interest in property pays off a prior charge on that property for the protection of his own interest and cases in which a person acquires an interest in property only by reason of his advancing money to pay off an existing mortgage debt It seems to me that the first clause of Section must be held to relate to the first type of cases above referred to and the third clause to the second type between a person with a pre existing right and a person acquiring a right by reason of the advance he makes But the learned Judge did not however express any opinion on the interpretation placed by us does not exist and that on a proper construction of Section a person who advances money to a mortgagor and takes a mortgage or sale would come within Clause i of Section Considerable reliance was placed upon certain decisions of <ORG> and the interpretation placed upon them by our <ORG> and other <ORG>s I shall first explain the scope of the rule in <NAME> <NAME> Mer The limit of the rule as enunciated therein is thus explained by Lord <NAME> in <NAME> <NAME> A A purchaser who took a conveyance purporting to be free from encumbrances could not set up a mortgage which had been paid off out of the purchase money against an encumbrance subsequent in date of which he had constructive notice In dealing with this he observed the presumption was the other way remarking that if there was no reason for keeping it alive equity would in the absence of any declaration of his intention destroy it but if there was a reason for keeping it alive equity would not destroy it He then took the case of a purchaser and observed that if he paid off a charge he might have it assigned to a trustee for himself or might have a declaration inserted in the deed that the charge should be treated as remaining on foot for the purpose of protecting him against any encumbrances According to <NAME> <NAME> Ch a purchaser who pays off a charge must show an intention to keep it alive if he wishes to prevent its merger and such an intention was shown in that case Their Lordships of <ORG> after citing the rule in <NAME> <NAME> Ch as enunciated by <NAME> <NAME> proceeded to apply the said rule in the following words Applying that rule to the present case it must be presumed in the absence of any expression of intention to the contrary that <NAME> who when he borrowed the money to pay off <NAME> mortgage claimed to be the owner of the estate and was stated on the face of the bond to be so intended that the money should be applied in paying off that mortgage and in extinguishing the charge there being no intermediate encumbrance Although the money was paid by the plaintiff gumastha to <NAME> estate it was paid with money borrowed from the plaintiff by <NAME> and for wfeich <NAME> was liable to him It will be seen that <NAME> was treated as the owner in fee and the amount borrowed by him and paid in discharge of the prior mortgage was treated as money paid by the owner in fee Though the money was expressly borrowed for the purpose of paying off the prior mortgage their Lordships negatived the right of subrogation Their Lordships remarked that as there was no intermediate encumbrance the charge must be deemed to be extinguished and they declined to raise an equity in favour of <NAME> In that case a person in execution of a money decree purchased in <ORG> auction a certain property which was admittedly subject to more than one mortgage Sir <NAME> formulates the question thus and answers it The obvious question to ask in the interests of justice equity and good conscience is what was the intention of the party paying off the charge He had a right to extinguish it and a right to keep it alive What was his intention If there is no express evidence of it what intention should be ascribed to him In the familiar instance of a tenant for life paying off a charge upon the inheritance he is assumed in the absence of evidence to the contrary to have intended to keep the charge alive Their Lordships therefore treated the case of a purchaser of an equity of redemption in exactly the same position as a life tenant that is a person having an existing interest in the property and discharging a prior mortgage by reason of such an existing interest and not being under a personal liability to pay the charge or being under a contractual liability to pay the encumbrance Prima facie therefore as stated by <NAME> in his book on Mortgages Section If the money be paid by one who has assumed the duty of paying the debt either by contract with the mortgagor or with those who may have succeeded to his rights this must be taken as regards other subsequent interests as a payment and as the payment was in pursuance of his agreement it may be regarded as made with the mortgagor money The parties can well arrange to the contrary but not doing so it seems reasonable that the debt satisfied for one purpose should be deemed satisfied for all purposes Indeed the improved position of the second mortgagee would seem after all to be only consistent with his contract if such contract be considered as it reasonably maybe to have been a contract that he should have a security on the property but subject to a prior charge so long as the creditor having that charge remained unpaid It will be seen from this passage that it is open to the parties to arrange to the contrary where a person advancing the money had no notice of an intermediate encumbrance or other circumstances which would raise equity in his favour Even in such cases where from the terms of the mortgage deed or purchase deed it is clear that the intention to keep alive a charge is inconsistent with the real intention of the parties it would not be kept alive because the mortgagee or purchaser finds it would have been better for him to have kept the charge alive That case was one in which the mortgagee had not an existing interest but acquired an interest in consideration of certain money paid to the mortgagor and prima facie the money so paid to the mortgagor would be the money of the mortgagor with which the prior mortgage would have been redeemed Both these cases illustrate the distinction between the case of a person having an existing interest and the case of a person acquiring an interest Sections and of the Act enacted that every second or subsequent mortgagee on discharging a prior mortgage will be entitled to all his rights The sections gave effect to the recognition of the principle that a person having an existing interest and not being under personal or contractual liability to pay an encumbrance is entitled to be subrogated to the rights of a prior encumbrance which is discharged Section provides for the case of a co mortgagor Section provides for the case of a union of interests that is the case of an incumbrancer becoming owner of the property It was applied also to the case of a purchaser of equity of redemption discharging a prior encumbrance It will be seen from the language of Section that it is a statutory right and the <ORG> do not go into the question whether it was for the benefit of the subsequent mortgagee to keep the prior mortgage alive or not the presumption which was automatically raised in such cases in England was recognised as a statutory right In the case of a person who advances money for the purpose of paying off a mortgage and takes a mortgage or sale the principle would be that prima facie the prior mortgage is discharged unless there is an agreement that it should be kept alive or the mortgagee or the vendee shows that there is some reason for presuming or implying such an agreement in his favour as the subsistence of an intermediate incumbrance that is the onus is on him to prove it The presumption and onus are not the same as in the two classes of cases that is in the case where a person having an existing interest discharges a prior mortgage and a person acquiring an interest discharges a mortgage The result of the case law in regard to presumption and onus in cases where a charge is not discharged by a mortgagor and in the absence of an expression of intention or an express agreement to have the charge kept alive may be summarised thus If a charge is paid off by a tenant for life he retains the benefit of it against the inheritance The presumption is that he intends to keep it alive It would seem that <ORG> applied the principle applicable to cases coming under this class to the case of a purchaser of an equity of redemption discharging a mortgage apparently on the ground that the charge was by an owner of an existing interest at It appears to me that it would more appropriately come under the next class of cases Where the owner of an estate in fee pays off a charge the presumption is the other way Equity would in the absence of any declaration of his intention destroy it but if there was a reason for keeping it alive such as the existence of another encumbrance equity would not destroy it If he pays the charge created by his predecessor the presumption is merger but he can keep it alive or if there is an intermediate incumbrance or other circumstances which will have to be proved a rebutting presumption will be made in his favour The onus of proving such circumstances is on him though admission of them might dispense with proof in some cases Under this category in my opinion would come the case also of a purchaser of an equity of redemption discharging a mortgage The presumption would be merger but where there is an expression of an intention or an intermediate encumbrance or such a continuance would be for his benefit a rebutting presumption will be made in his favour Where a person advances money to discharge a mortgage and takes a mortgage or sale the presumption is that the mortgage is extinguished But if it is shown that there is an intermediate encumbrance or other circumstances which raise equity in his favour the presumption shifts or is rebutted and an agreement with the borrower that the mortgage was to be kept alive is presumed or implied Where there is no intermediate incumbrance or any other circumstances which would raise an equity in his favour the original presumption that the mortgage is extinguished will not give place to a rebutting presumption in his favour and the onus is on him to prove that there was an express agreement to keep the mortgage alive Where one advances money to another for paying off a mortgage without stipulating for any security the presumption is that the mortgage is discharged unless by an agreement with the borrower he is subrogated to the mortgage security A question arose whether the mortgage in favour of <NAME> had priority over an attachment of property which came into effect before the date of the mortgage Their Lordships from the nature of the transaction inferred an agreement that the mortgages intended to be discharged should be kept alive they remarked thus Here the mortgagor was paying off his own debts but he was doing so for the benefit of <NAME> and in performance of the agreement with him Therefore their Lordships recognised that though the money would prima facie become the money of the mortgagor as in the Calcutta case as the money was paid in performance of an agreement with the mortgagee it should be kept alive It would have been very easy for their Lordships to apply the rule under Section of the Transfer of Property Act by treating <NAME> as a second mortgagee but they would not apply that section because that section was intended to relate only to a person having an existing interest in the property and discharging a prior mortgage out of his own money without being under a stipulation with the mortgagor to discharge it from and out of the consideration money for his mortgage Therefore the distinction between a person having an existing right and the person acquiring an interest was kept in view by their Lordships of <ORG> there was a mortgage in favour of one <NAME> on th February which was effected for the purpose of discharging a zerpeshgi debt dated th November Their Lordships gave the benefit of subrogation to <NAME> in respect of the zerpeshgi deed dated th November by inferring an agreement that that mortgage should be kept alive lent by <NAME> were in accordance with the agreement between <NAME> and <NAME> applied in paying off the zerpeshgi debt that on payment of that debt the zerpeshgi deed of the th November was handed over to <NAME> and that <NAME> when she lent her Rs they observe that applying the rule of justice equity and good conscience the charge was kept alive It is also significant that their Lordships did not apply Section of the Transfer of Property Act but invoked the principle of equity thus again illustrating the distinction between a person having an existing interest and a person acquiring an interest This principle was again illustrated in <NAME> Jugal Kishore A I where in respect of half of the purchase money their Lordships did not give the benefit of subrogation by implying an agreement because there was no intermediate encumbrance <NAME> does recognise that and Calcutta cases were based on conventional subrogation and that Section of the Transfer of Property Act would not apply to cases where a person is under a contractual liability to discharge a mortgage As remarked by <NAME> Section i deals with the case of a person having an existing interest and Section iii deals with the case where under the previous state of the law the right of subrogation was invoked on the doctrine of conventional subrogation This follows from the plain language of the section and there is very good reason why the <ORG> adopted this view In the case of a person having an existing interest there is no need to resort to any agreement express or implied and Section of the Transfer of Property Act before the amendment gave partial recognition in favour of second and subsequent mortgagees and Section i only extended the said principle In other cases the <ORG> had to go into questions of intention in certain cases coming to the conclusion that there was an intention to keep the mortgage alive and in certain other cases that there was no such intention The <ORG> therefore enacted the rule in Section iii as it is always open to a person who advances money to enter into an agreement The legislature does give the benefit of the principle of subrogation even in such cases but the legislature requires that the person intended to take advantage of the benefit must comply with certain requirements the requirements being a registered instrument for keeping alive the prior mortgage which can always be done even by the very transaction sale or mortgage under which the money was advanced by making a declaration that it was agreed between the parties that the prior mortgage was intended to be kept alive It is contended by Mr <NAME> that the words in Clause iii a person who has advanced money to a mortgagor money with which the mortgage has been redeemed are only intended to cover the case of a person who merely lends money without stipulating for any security as such a person cannot in law acquire any right of subrogation but for the statutory provision There is no warrant for placing such a narrow construction The words are wide enough to cover the case of a mortgagee or a vendee who advances money in consideration of a mortgage or sale All that the section requires is that money must have been received by the mortgagor from the person who advances it and with which the mortgage must have been redeemed What is contemplated by the section is the receipt of money by a mortgagor for the discharge of a mortgage and the redemption of such a mortgage with that money But as and by way of equity an agreement was inferred in cases where there is no express agreement for keeping the mortgage alive As the inference of such an intention is dependent upon a number of circumstances and to avoid <ORG> going into them Clause was enacted to confer a statutory right in such cases provided the person seeking the benefit of it fulfils the conditions mentioned in the section The Court below has answered this question in the negative In order to be subrogated to the rights of a mortgagee whose mortgage you redeem you must be either a a person entitled to sue for redemption Clause i of Section or a person who has advanced money to a mortgagor for redeeming a mortgage and a person who has contracted for subrogation with the mortgagor by a registered instrument Clause iii of Section Section tells us who are persons entitled to sue for redemption Persons entitled to institute a suit for redemption fall into three classes only any person who has an interest in or charge upon the property mortgaged or an interest in or charge upon the right to redeem any surety for payment of the mortgage debt or a part thereof any creditor of the mortgagor who in a suit for administration of his estate has obtained a decree for sale of the mortgaged property They were not persons entitled to sue for redemption when they purchased property burdened with a mortgage debt That is the principle laid down in the first clause of Section A rule of equity has been given statutory recognition and it has been strictly confined and limited to persons entitled to sue for redemption A person not entitled to sue for redemption who purchases property subject to mortgage becomes ipso facto a person entitled to sue for redemption which is the very reverse of saying that he is subrogated to the rights of the mortgagee A person not entitled to sue for redemption who buys mortgaged property that is advances money to the mortgagor with which the mortgage is redeemed may however contract with the mortgagor for the right to be subrogated to the mortgagee whose mortgage has been redeemed The state of the law on the subject of subrogation before the Amending Act XX of is a matter of academic interest but as a matter of fact the Amending Act merely gave effect to a simple rule of equity the application of which to the various classes of persons who claimed its benefits was difficult The rule has been defined and the persons to whom the rule is applicable have been classified I agree with my learned brother that this appeal fails and must be dismissed with costs The decree that we pass herein will be without prejudice to the right of the mortgagors and the purchasers of the equity of redemption to claim any relief under the Madras Agriculturists Relief Act
