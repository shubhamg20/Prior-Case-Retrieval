The present application is admittedly time barred unless appellant can claim a new starting point for limitation under Article of the Indian Limitation Act by showing that he applied within three years of the prior execution petition to take some step in aid of execution There are two petitions Exhibits and and a plaint in another suit Exhibit which as appellant contends should be regarded as such applications It is argued that the entry of satisfaction asked for by respondent would have effectively prevented the execution of the decree and that for this reason the counter statement Exhibit should be treated as an application to take a step in aid of execution of the decree Such a construction seems to me altogether unwarranted and to fail to give effect to the words of the article The article classes together an application for execution and an application to take some step in aid of execution and the latter words appear to be intended to cover an application which is not an initial application for execution but is an application to take some step to advance an execution proceeding which is already pending application to bring to sale properties already under attachment The petition Exhibit may tend to prevent the <ORG> placing an obstacle in the way of future execution of the decree but it does not ask the <ORG> to take any step in aid of execution We have been referred by the learned <NAME> on both sides to numerous other cases in which the inters pretation of this article has been in question is a fair example dealing with an application by the decree holder for adjournment of execution proceedings in order to enable him to produce further evidence Which of such applications should be treated as falling within the article has become a very difficult question to decide if effect is to be given to all the views expressed in the different judgments It seems to me if I may say so with respect that in some cases the <ORG> in their anxiety to prevent decree holders being deprived of the fruits of their decrees by the technical plea of limitation have stretched the article to such a point that it has become difficult for the most experienced lawyer to say nothing of layman to gay when many decrees will become time barred In a matter like limitation certainty is the first desideratum it matters comparatively little whether a decree holder is allowed years or to execute his decree as long as he knows for certain when the time allowed him will come to an end But whatever case may be made out for an application made in connexion with a pending execution petition as one for taking a step in aid or furtherance of it an application made at a time when no execution petition is pending stands on an obviously different footing As a matter of fact in that case an execution petition filed by the objector apparently was pending at any rate at the time the insolvency petition was filed but apart from this it seems to me with all respect that the reasoning of the learned Judges does not justify such an extension of the article and I observe that they expressly say they do not seek to lay down any general principle and desire to confine their judgment to the unusual facts before them Ramesam certainly says there is no warrant for the view that an application to take a step is aid of execution should be made in execution meaning apparently while an execution is pending But he gives no reasons and does not discuss the point and with all respect I feel compelled to dissent I must therefore hold that the counter petition Exhibit is not an application to take a step in aid of execution Nor does Exhibit This is the plaint filed by appellant in the last mentioned suit seeking to set aside a settlement deed executed by respondent in respect of certain immovable properties as void under Section of the Transfer of Property Act I cannot see how by any stretch of reasoning the presentation of this plaint could be treated as an application to take a step in aid of execution of the decree in Original Suit No of An alternative contention put forward by appellant is that he is entitled to ask that the time during which Execution Application No of was pending should not be counted against him This plea does not profess to be based on anything in the Limitation Act but reliance is placed on the decision of a Bench of three Judges of <ORG> <NAME> <NAME> I Calc in which it appears to have been held that the relaxations of the ordinary law of limitation provided in the Limitation Act are not exhaustive and that in the case then under consideration the plaintiffs were entitled to count in their favour the period during which they were precluded from bringing their suit by reason of the existence of a decree in a previous suit which covered the same matter In that case stress was laid on the fact that the prior decree If relief against limitation is to be allowed in cases not provided for in the Limitation Act surely this should only be done in cases where justice and equity clearly require it The decision in that case turned on a construction of Article Limitation Act with which we have no concern bat the principle of suspension and the question of whether <ORG> intended to lay down any rule as to the exhaustiveness of the exemptions contained in the Limitation Act were no doubt discussed and were in fact the points raised in the reference that even if it is open to us to allow a suspension of time not provided for in the Limitation Act there is no justification for doing so here I would dismiss the Appeal with costs
