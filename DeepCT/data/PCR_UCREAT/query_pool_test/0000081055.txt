HEADNOTE The assessee company carries on the business of generation and distribution of electricity at <ORG> and as such is covered by the provisions of Section and is entitled to claim the deduction contemplated by the said provision The assessee company had sold some of its old machinery and buildings resulting in balancing charges contemplated by section which worked out to Rs There were unabsorbed depreciation of Rs arising under Section had been wrongly allowed and that for the purpose of calculating the deduction of the items in respect of the unabsorbed depreciation and development rebate should not have been excluded and that if proper calculations as suggested by him were made the assessee was not entitled to any deduction being profits arising from the sale of old machinery and buildings under of the Act could not be treated in isolation or divorced from the profits and gains of the business of generation and distribution of electricity done by the assessee company and that the said item will have to be regarded as profits By its judgment dated th and th of December disposing of the Reference <ORG> upheld the view of the <ORG> regarding the item of Rs Both the assessee and the <ORG> preferred separate appeals against the said judgment A Three important steps are required to be taken before the special deduction permissible under section of Income Tax Act is allowed and the net total income exigible to tax is determined secondly ascertain what part of the total income so computed represents the profits and gains attributable to the business of the specified industry here generation and distribution of electricity and thirdly if there be profits and gains so attributable deduct thereof from such profits and gains and then arrive at the net total income exigible to tax As regards the first step mentioned above the important words in sub are those that appear in parenthesis namely as computed in accordance with the other provisions of this Act and these words clearly contain a mandate that the total income of the concerned assessee must be computed in accordance with the other provisions of the Act without reference to and since in the instant case it is income from business the same as per will have to be computed in accordance with Ss to A which would include It is true that by legal fiction created under a balancing charge arising from sale of old machinery or building is treated as deemed income and the same is brought to tax in other words the legal fiction enables the <ORG> to take back what it had given by way of depreciation allowance in the preceding years since what was given in the preceding years was in excess of that which ought to have been given This shows that the fiction has been created for the purpose of computation of the assessable income of the assessee under the head business Income A Legal fictions are created only for a definite purpose and they should be limited to the purpose for which they are created and should not be extended beyond their legitimate field The fiction under is created for the purpose of computation of assessable income of the assessee under the head business income and under in order to compute and allow the permissible special deduction computation of total income in accordance with the other provisions of the Act is required to be done and after allowing such deduction the net assessable income chargeable to tax is to be determined in other words the legal fiction under and the grant of special deduction in case of specified industries are so closely connected with each other that taking into account the balancing charge i deemed profits before computing deduction under would amount to extending the legal fiction within the limits of the purpose for which the said fiction had been created Whenever the <ORG> wanted to give a restricted meaning it has used the expression derived from as for instance in Since the expression of wider import namely attributable to has been used the legislature intended to cover receipts from sources other than the actual conduct of the business of generation and distribution of electricity Having regard to the construction placed on sub of Section as above it is obvious that in computing the total income of the concerned assessee items of unabsorbed depreciation and unabsorbed development rebate will have to be deducted before arriving at the figure that will become exigible to the deduction of contemplated by In sub of the expression total income is followed by the words as computed in accordance with the other provisions of this Act in parenthesis and the mandate of these words clearly negatives the argument that the expression total income has been used in the sense of commercial profits The expression total income has been defined in of the Act as meaning the total amount of income referred to in Section computed in the manner laid down in this Act and when this definition has been furnished by the Act itself the expression as appearing in must be in the absence of anything in the context suggesting to the contrary be construed in accordance with such definition The question whether special benefit under as well as the normal or usual benefit of carry forward of losses of previous years should both be available to an assessee without one impinging on the other must depend upon the intention of the <ORG> and such intention has to be gathered from the language employed On proper construction of the provisions contained in sub of a item like unabsorbed depreciation and absorbed development rebate will have to be deducted in arriving at the figure which would be exigible to deduction of under I held inapplicable The Judgment of the Court was delivered by TULZAPURKAR These two appeals by special leave one by the Commissioner of Income Tax Gujarat and the other by the assessee against the judgment of Gujarat <ORG> in Income Tax Reference No of raise two interesting questions regarding the mode in which and the fund from which deduction of contemplated by section of the Income Tax Act as it stood at the relevant time should be computed The short facts giving rise to the questions may be stated The assessee <ORG> carries on the Business of generation and distribution of electricity at Cambay and as such is covered by the provisions of and is entitled to claim the deduction contemplated by the said provision The assessment in question relates to the assessment year the accounting year for which is the financial year ending March It further appears that there was unabsorbed depreciation of Rs It will appear clear from the above computation that the Income Tax Officer treated the item of Rs arising under had been wrongly allowed and that for the purpose of calculating the deduction of the items in respect of the unabsorbed depreciation and development rebate should not have been excluded and that if proper calculations as suggested by him were made the assessee was not entitled to any deduction He therefore set aside the order of the Income Tax Officer and directed that fresh assessment be made in accordance with law Feeling aggrieved by the order passed by the Additional Commissioner of Income Tax the assessee preferred an appeal to <ORG> being profits arising from the sale of old machinery and buildings under of the Act the <ORG> took the view that the said item of profits could not be treated in isolation or divorced from the profits and gains of the business of generation and distribution of electricity done by the assessee company and that the said item will have to be regarded as profits attributable to though not derived from the business of generation and distribution of electricity and as such the said item was exigible to the deduction of under of the Act The <ORG> accordingly allowed the appeal set aside the order of the Additional Commissioner and restored that of the income Tax Officer At the instance of the Commissioner of Income Tax the <ORG> referred the following two questions to <ORG> for its opinion Whether the <ORG> was correct in holding that the Profits under section of the Income Tax Act arising from the sale of machinery and building amounting to Rs is not deductible in computing profits under section of the Act <ORG> by its judgment dated th and th December disposed of the Reference by answering the first question in favour of the assessee and the second question in favour In other words <ORG> upheld the view of the <ORG> on the first question while on the second question it took the view that the unabsorbed depreciation and development rebate were deductible before arriving at the figure that would be exigible to the deduction of under and therefore Civil Appeal No NT of has been preferred by the <ORG> in so far as the answer to the first question has gone against it while Civil Appeal No NT of has been preferred by the assessee inasmuch as the second question has been answered in favour of the <ORG> He emphasized that under that section a deduction of is permissible from such profits and gains meaning profits and gains attributable to the business of generation and distribution of electricity carried on by an assessee He contended that a balancing charge contemplated under is really in the nature of a return of capital and not a return of revenue and it is only by reason of the fiction created by that the same is deemed to be a revenue receipt and has been made chargeable to income tax as income of the business but it is well settled that a legal fiction is to be limited to the purpose for which it is created and should not be extended beyond its legitimate field which is not really any profit or gain earned in the conduct of the business of generation and distribution of electricity cannot be He pointed out that in the first place requires the computation of the total income of the assessee carrying on specified industry in accordance with the other provisions of this Act secondly such total income so computed should include profits and gains attributable to the business of the specified industry here generation and distribution of electricity and thirdly it is from such profits attributable to the business of the specified industry that the deduction of should be made He laid considerable emphasis on the aspect that the <ORG> has used the expression attributable to the business of instead of derived from the business of and according to him the former being an expression of Wider import would include an item like the balancing charge which may not be directly derived from the conduct of the business of the specified industry here generation and distribution of electricity In our view the answer to the question raised before us really turns upon the proper construction of the provision contained in of the Act rather than on what is the real nature or character of a balancing charge arising under of the Act and it would therefore be proper to set out the provisions of as it stood at the relevant time In the case of a company to which this section applies where the total income as computed in accordance with the other provisions of this Act includes any profits and gains attributable to the business of generation or distribution of electricity or any other form of power or of construction manufacture or production of any one or more of the articles or things specified in the list in the Fifth Schedule there shall be allowed a deduction from such profits and gains of an amount equal to eight per cent thereof in computing the total income of the company This section applies to a an Indian company or any other company which has made the prescribed arrangements for the declaration and payment of dividends including dividends on preference shares within India but does not apply to any Indian company referred to in clause a or to any other company referred to in clause if such Indian or other company is a company referred to in section and its total income as computed before applying the provisions of sub section does not exceed twenty five thousand rupees It was not disputed before us that the aforesaid provision contained in has been enacted for the purpose of providing for certain special deduction to be made in computing the total income in the case of specified industries over and above the other general deductions contemplated by the Act us that the assessee being an Indian company engaged in the business of generation and distribution of electricity is a company to which the section applies and is entitled to claim the deduction of contemplated by that provision and the only question is how and in what manner the said deduction should be computed On reading sub it will become clear that three important steps are required to be taken before the special deduction permissible thereunder is allowed and the net total income exigible to tax is determined First compute the total income of the concerned assessee in accordance with the other provisions of the Act i in accordance with all the provisions except secondly ascertain what part of the total income so computed represents the profits and gains attributable to the business of the specified industry here generation and distribution of electricity and thirdly if there be profits and gains so attributable deduct thereof from such profits and gains and then arrive at the net total income exigible to tax As regards the first step mentioned above the important words in sub are those that appear in parenthesis namely as computed in accordance with the other provisions of this Act and these words clearly contain a mandate that the total income of the concerned assessee must be computed in accordance with the other provisions of the Act without reference to and since in the instant case it is income from business the same as per will have to be computed in accordance with ss to A which would include In the case of <ORG> supra the question that arose for determination was whether a balancing charge which was brought to tax on the basis of deemed income and was therefore included in the assessable income of an assessee under the second proviso to cl vii of sub of of the Act equivalent to of the Act could be taken into account while considering smallness of profit for purposes of deciding whether the case attracted the applicability of A of the Act and this <ORG> took the view that the balancing charge was not real income but was made taxable income for the purpose of computation of the assessable income by legal fiction but on that account it did not become commercial profit and was not liable to be taken into account in assessing whether in view of the smallness of profits a larger dividend would be unreasonable in that context this <ORG> observed that what in truth was a capital return was by a fiction regarded for the purposes of the Act as income and was made chargeable to income tax but because of that its character was not altered and it was not converted into assessee business profits and that smallness of profit in A had to be adjudged in the light of commercial principles and not in the light of total receipts actual or fictional In the subsequent decision in the <ORG> case supra this <ORG> has regarded a balancing charge as being the escaped profits of the business for which the assessee is made liable to tax If the machinery is sold for Rs If it had not been allowed that amount would have swelled the profits to that extent The second proviso therefore in substance brings to charge an escaped profit or gain of the business carried on by the assessee These apparently divergent views have given rise to two rival contentions urged before us by counsel on other tide It is unnecessary in this case to go into the question whether the divergence is real or merely apparent for It is true that by a legal fiction created under a balancing charge arising from sale of old machinery or building is treated as deemed income and the same is brought to tax in other words the legal fiction enables the <ORG> to take back what it had given by way of depreciation allowance in the preceding years since what was given in the preceding years was in excess of that which ought to have been given This shows that the fiction has been created for the purpose of computation of the assessable income of the assessee under the head Business Income It was rightly pointed out by the learned Solicitor General that legal fictions are created only for a definite purpose and they should be limited to the purpose for which they are created and should not be extended beyond their legitimate field But as indicated earlier the fiction under is created for the purpose of computation of assessable income of the assessee under the head Business Income and under in order to compute and allow the permissible special deduction computation of total income in accordance with the other provisions of the Act is required to be done and after allowing such deduction the net assesaable income chargeable to tax is to be determined in other words the legal fiction under and the grant of special deduction in case of specified industries are so closely connected with each other that taking into account the balancing charge i deemed profits before computing the deduction under would amount to extending the legal fiction within the limits of the purpose for which the said fiction had been created As regards the aspect emerging from the expression attributable to occurring in the phrase profits and gains attributable to the business of the specified industry here generation and distribution of electricity on which the learned Solicitor General relied it will be pertinent to observe that the <ORG> has deliberately used the expression attributable to and not the expression derived from Had the expression derived from been used it could have with some force been contended that a balancing charge arising from the sale of old machi nery and buildings cannot be regarded as profits and gains derived from the conduct of the business of generation and distribution of electricity In this connection it may be pointed out that whenever the <ORG> wanted to give a restricted meaning in the manner suggested by the learned Solicitor General it has used the expression derived from as for instance in For the aforesaid reasons and particularly on true construction of the provision itself we are of the view that both the <ORG> and <ORG> were right in taking the view that the item of Rs Here again the answer to the question must depend upon the construction of sub of and the construction which we have placed on the said provision while disposing of the <ORG> appeal will furnish the correct answer to the question posed As indicated earlier sub contemplates three steps being taken for computing the special deduction permissible thereunder and arriving at the net income exigible to tax and the first two steps read together contain the Legislative mandate as to how the total income of which the profits and gains attributable to the business of the specified industry forms a part of the concerned assessee is to be computed and according to the parenthetical clause Which contains the key words the same is to be computed in accordance with the provisions a the Act except and since in this case it is income from business the same will have to be computed in accordance with ss to A which would include which provides for carry forward of depreciation and which provides for carry forward of development rabate for eight years On this construction therefore <ORG> in our view was right in deducting unabsorbed depreciation and development rebate aggregating to Rs from Rs In the first place before <ORG> it was strenuously urged though not seriously before us that the expression total income appearing in has been used in its commercial sense and since neither the unabsorbed depreciation nor the unabsorbed development rebate has anything to do with commercial profits in sub of the expression total income is followed by the words as computed in accordance with the other provisions of this Act in parenthesis and the mandate of these words clearly negatives the argument that the expression total income has been used in the sense of commercial profits Secondly the expression total income has been defined in of the Act as meaning the total amount of income referred to in section computed in the manner laid down in this Act and when this definition has been furnished by the Act itself the expression as appearing in must in the absence of any thing in the context suggesting to the contrary be construed in accordance with such definition It may be stated that the first two decisions did not deal with the question of unabsorbed depreciation or unabsorbed rebate but merely dealt with the question of carried forward losses in the context of while the third decision dealt with all the three things carried forward loss carried forward depreciation and carried forward development rebate in the context of and it was held that the deduction under will have to be worked out before setting off or adjusting each of the three things In that case <ORG> held that as regards carried forward loss the point was covered by its earlier decision in <NAME> case supra that unabsorbed development rebate stood on the same footing as unabsorbed losses and as regards unabsorbed depreciation it took the view that since itself postponed the adjustment of unabsorbed depreciation to a stage subsequent to the set off of business losses under and set off of the losses in speculation business under the unabsorbed depreciation cannot be It will thus appear clear that in the last mentioned case unabsorbed development rebate was held to be non deductible for the same reasons for which unabsorbed loss could not be deducted under the earlier decision and the unabsorbed depreciation was held to be non deductible on the basis of de priori reasoning The question that arises for consideration therefore is whether the view taken in regard to non deductibility of carried for I It is true that in the instant case the question of deductibility or otherwise of carried forward losses of earlier years in the context of has not directly arisen before us but since counsel for the assessee has raised a contention about non deductibility of unabsorbed depreciation and unabsorbed development rebate on the basis of the view taken by <ORG> in <ORG> case supra and <ORG> in <NAME> case supra in regard to nondeductibility of unabsorbed losses of earlier years we are constrained to express our opinion on the validity of the view taken in those two cases In our opinion the view taken in <ORG> case supra and <NAME> case supra in regard to the nondeductibility of unabsorbed losses of the earlier years in the context of computing the deduction under of the Act is open to grave doubts After pointing out that Chapter IV of the Act deals with the computation of income falling under the various heads mentioned in of the Act that Chapter VI in which occurs deals with the aggregation of income and set off or carry forward of loss and that deals with deduction to be made in computing total income the <ORG> has proceeded to observe thus Computation as such is used only in the heading in Chapter IV Section Also provides that in computing the total income of an assessee there shall be included all income on which no income tax is payable under Chapter VII etc What is provided in section is also relating to computation Similarly the same words are used in section But there are no such words in section Section speaks of the net result of the computation under the bead Profits and gains of business or profession We consider that the set off permitted under section is from an amount arrived at after applying the provisions of Chapter IV along with other sections of the Act such as sections and etc The Court has further observed that in its opinion the deduction under is a special benefit given to a company which satisfies the conditions under section and the deduction permissible thereunder is only from profits and gains attributable to the specified activities and this benefit should not be diminished by the other benefits conferred by the Act such as the right to have the previous losses set off that the two serve different purposes and the benefit of both must be available to an assessee without the one impinging on the other It will thus appear that <ORG> has regarded section appear ing in Chapter VI as a provision unconnected with the computation of the total income of an assessee and a provision which comes into operation at a stage subsequent to the computation of the total income arising from business done in accordance with ss to A occurring in Chapter IV of the Act and therefore the unabsorbed losses cannot be set off before calculating the deduction under It is not possible to accept the view that has no bearing on or is unconnected with the computation of the total income of an assessee under the head Profits and gains of business or profession Actually provides that where the net result of computation under the head Profits and gains of business or profession is a loss and such loss cannot be or is not Wholly set off against the income under any head of income in accordance with the provisions of so much of the loss as has not been so set off subject to the other provisions of the Chapter shall be carried forward to the following assessment year and shall be set off against the profits and gains if any of any business or profession for that assessment year Further the question whether special benefit under as well as the normal or usual benefit of carry forward of losses of previous years should both be available to an assessee without one impinging on the other must depend upon the intention of the <ORG> and such intention has to be gathered from the language employed As observed earlier on proper construction of the provision contained in sub of items like unabsorbed depreciation and unabsorbed development rebate will have to be deducted in arriving at the figure which would be exigible to deduction of under In our view that decision has nothing whatever to do with the question posed before us In that case the question was whether the loss incurred by an assessee in non priority business could be set off against the profits and gains made by the assessee in the priority business while computing the deduction under and <ORG> upheld the <ORG> view that for the purpose of allowing a deduction under the words such profits occurring in that section mean the profits and gains attributable to an activity as specified in the th Schedule of the Act and therefore the deduction was required to be worked out with out reference to the loss incurred in non priority business The decision was rendered on the language of but it cannot avail the assessee on the point raised in the appeal
