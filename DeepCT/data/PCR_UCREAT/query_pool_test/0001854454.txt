Probate was accordingly granted to <NAME> who himself died not many years later on the th August After this applications were made for the same purpose by <NAME> <NAME> and others but on the rd September this Court held that no Letters of Administration could be issued as the estate had been completely administered and the only object of the rival applicants was to secure indirectly a decision upon the question of title to the shebaitship <NAME> had not been made a party in that suit and he consequently instituted the present litigation on the th September for declaration that he himself was interested to the extent of a four annas share in the shebaitship In this connection we must bear in mind the observation of Sir <NAME> in <NAME> <NAME> I A Bom Consequently upon the death of <NAME> the shebaitship vested in <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> who were the heirs of the founder at the time But it has been argued for the appellant that <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> took successive life estates in the office with the result that the remainder at the death of the founder constituted a vested interest in the hands of his six sons In this view <NAME> would get through his father <NAME> one sixth share while <NAME> would ultimately receive a half share by transmission to him of the interests vested in <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> would thus have a third share by absorption of the interest of <NAME> When a Hindu female is thus in possession she represents the estate completely and though her powers of disposition may be of a restricted character no one else has a vested interest in the estate during her life time namely that the rule that when a worship of a thakoor has been founded the shebaitship is vested in the heirs of the founder in default of evidence that he has disposed of it otherwise or of there being some evidence of usage course of dealing or some circumstances to show a different mode of devolution cannot be applied so as to vest the shebaitship in persons who according to the usages of the worship cannot perform the rights of the office The decree made by the Subordinate Judge correctly determines the rights of the parties and as no question of limitation really arises on the evidence that decree must be affirmed The result is that the appeal is dismissed with costs We assess the hearing fee at ten gold mohurs
