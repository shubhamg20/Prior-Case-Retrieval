The claimants who are the husband of <NAME> as well as other minor children have filed the claim petition wherein they have claimed compensation for the deaths of <NAME> as well as <NAME> to the tune of Rs It was averred in the petition that <NAME> was earning a sum of Rs Reply to the claim petition was filed by the respondents in which it was admitted that the accident took place However <NAME> the driver of the Haryana Roadways Bus averred that the accident has took place due to negligence of the cyclist and he was not responsible for the accident Both the witnesses were cross examined at length by the counsel for the <ORG> and the respondents have tried to make much capital with regard to the time of the accident One RW <NAME> stated that he was sitting in the front seat of the bus and said that the accident had taken place due to negligence riding of the cyclist and not the bus driver and thus the bus driver is not responsible After going through the evidence on record it is clear that when <NAME> who was riding the cycle he had given a signal at that time the bus was approximately yards away There was sufficient time for the bus driver to slow down and apply brakes as the distance of yards is good enough to take a evasive action Therefore in these circumstances it is held that the accident took place because of the rash and negligent driving of <NAME> driver of the bus The next question that arises in the present case is as to what amount of compensation the claimants are entitled to It has come in the evidence of <NAME> husband of deceased <NAME> that the deceased used to do the work of tailoring and stitching Apart from the statement of <NAME> there is also a statement of <NAME> had stated that his wife had got suits stitched from the deceased and she used to earn approximately Rs per month which comes to Rs She had five minor children and therefore in these circumstances I am inclined to apply a multiplier of Accordingly claimants are entitled to compensation of Rs The claimants shall also be entitled to interest at the rate of seven and a half per cent instead of percent as awarded by the <ORG> The entire amount shall be paid by the respondents after deducting the amount already paid The claimants shall be entitled to the interest from the date of filing of the claim petition till realisation
