Sarvabhauman Associates for the Appellant and the respondents not appearing in person or by Advocate and having stood over for consideration till this day the Court delivered the following judgment The appellant is the st defendant and the respondents are the plaintiffs and the nd defendant before the lower Court The respondents to who are the plaintiffs before the lower <ORG> filed the suit in No on the file of Principal District Munsif <ORG> at Karur for declaration of their exclusive title to the suit property and for a consequential permanent injunction or in the alternative for the relief of possession in case if it is found that the defendants trespassed into the suit property The appellant st defendant filed a written statement which was adopted by the nd defendant stating that it is not correct to state that the suit property originally belonged to <NAME> and she was in exclusive possession of the same and the plaintiffs are put to strict proof of the execution and attestation of the settlement deed dated in their favour and the plaint is silent as to how <NAME> got title in the suit property and neither the plaintiffs nor their predecessor in title had any title or possession to the suit property at any time and the st defendant purchased the suit property from one <NAME> under a registered sale deed dated and the st defendant was in possession of the suit property and the st defendant sold a portion of the suit property to the nd defendant on and the defendants are in possession of the suit property on the date of suit and the allegation that they attempted to trespass into the suit property is denied and so the suit deserves dismissed with costs On the above pleading and considering the oral and documentary evidence placed the learned Principal District Munsif at Karur came to the conclusion that the plaintiffs have failed to prove their title to the suit property and they were in possession of the suit property on the date of suit as claimed by them and the defendants are in possession of the suit property and so the plaintiffs are not entitled to the reliefs of declaration of their title to the suit property and for the consequential relief of permanent injunction or in the alternative for the relief of possession and so the learned Principal District Munsif at Karur dismissed the suit with costs Aggrieved against the said findings of the trial Court the plaintiffs preferred an appeal in A No before the Sub Court at Karur and the learned Subordinate Judge at Karur came to the conclusion that the plaintiffs have proved their title beyond reasonable doubt language Tamil version Omitted Ed and the defendants attempted to interfere with the possession of the plaintiffs and so the plaintiffs are entitled to the reliefs of declaration of their title and for the consequential permanent injunction and so the learned Subordinate Judge at Karur set aside the judgment and decree of the trial Court and allowed the appeal and decreed the suit as prayed for with costs On the above pleadings and after hearing the learned counsel for the appellant the substantial questions of law that arise for consideration in this second appeal are as follows Whether the plaintiffs who are the respondents to in this second appeal have title to the suit property and whether they were in possession of the suit property on the date of suit Whether the recitals as to the boundaries in the documents marked as Exs Therefore the plaintiffs are claiming title to the northern half share with an east west ridge measuring an extent of cents out of the total extent of acres of land in No of Sanapatti Village It is the specific case of the plaintiffs in para of the plaint that originally the suit property belonged to one <NAME> who purchased it from one <NAME> on and the aforesaid Nachiyar Animal conveyed the same under the registered sale deed dated in favour of Krishnaswamy Naidu the husband of <NAME> who in turn executed a registered settlement deed dated in favour of the plaintiffs Thus the earliest document to prove the title of the plaintiffs to the suit property mentions an undivided acres out of the total extent of acres in No and not the northern half share with an east west ridge as mentioned in the description of property in the plaint schedule Within one year i on the very same <NAME> executed the sale deed dated under Ex A in favour of Krishnaswamy Naidu wherein we find the description of the suit property in the following words in Tamil Language Tamil version Omitted Ed In para of the plaint it is stated by the plaintiffs that Krishnasv amy Naidu who is the purchaser under Ex It is not known at what point of time this northern half share was allotted to Andalammal in a partition by metes and bounds in respect of the total extent of acres of land in suit No He did not say as to how the northern half share of cents was allotted to <NAME> before the execution of the settlement deed dated under Ex He attested the sale deed dated executed by <NAME> and <NAME> in favour of one <NAME> marked as Ex He also purchased cents of land from <NAME> Gounder and <NAME> on under the registered sale deed marked as Ex He went to the extent of staling in Tamil in the chief examination as follows Language Tamil version Omitted Ed A careful scrutiny of the oral and documentary evidence placed in this case I am of the view that the plaintiffs who are respondents to in this second appeal have not satisfactorily proved their title to the northern half share of cents of land with an east west ridge out of the total extent of acres of land in No as described in the plaint schedule The plaintiffs have come forward with a specific case in their plaint that the northern half share of cents of land with an east west ridge out of the total extent of acres of land in No belongs to them exclusively and on that basis they prayed for declaration of their title In other words the plaintiffs must succeed on the strength of their own title and that could be done by adducing satisfactory evidence to discharge the onus which is on them irrespective of the question whether the defendants have proved their case or not I am fortified with this view by two decisions of our <ORG> In the other decision reported in <NAME> <NAME> Mad Law Weekly a Division Bench of our Madras High Court laid down as follows It is the duty of the plaintiff to establish his claim on the basis of the averments made in the plaint The said suit in No of on the file of District <NAME> Court at Karur was filed for recovery of possession of the plaint A Schedule properties or in the alternative for partition and separate possession of half share in the plaint schedule properties and the learned District <NAME> at Karur decreed the suit in No of by stating that the plaintiff <NAME> will be entitled to a decree for partition and separate possession of half share in the plaint schedule properties as the certified copy of the decree in A No of on the file of <ORG> at Tiruchirapalli which is the appeal filed by the defendants and in No of by name <NAME> and <NAME> and the decree of the lower Court was modified in so far as it related to the suit costs and thereby the judgment and decree of the lower Court in No of in other respect was confirmed Ex to came into existence at a time when there was no dispute among the parties to the suit Therefore it is satisfactorily established by the defendants that their predecessors in title became entitled to cents on the western side in No are the subsequent sale deeds in respect of the property of <NAME> allotted to him earlier in the partition suit in No There is one clinching circumstance in this case to destroy the case of the plaintiffs and to lend support to the contention of the defendants herein and it is the Commissioner report and plan marked as Exs That was a suit filed by <NAME> as the plaintiff as against the defendant <NAME> herein categorically stated as follows <NAME> Advocate for the petitioner asked me to note whether there is any east west demarcating feature to divide the property on the north of the suit property the Survey Number of which is so as to show northern and southern portions in it There is no east west demarcating feature in No to divide it in the northern half and southern half which is dated and which is a lease deed executed by <NAME> and another in favour of <NAME> who is the predecessor in title will show that <NAME> leased out only the western half share in the suit No Considering the above facts and circumstances of the case I hold that the plaintiffs who are the respondents to in this second appeal have no title to the northern half share of cents of land out of the total extent of acres of land in which is stated to have been divided by east west ridge and they were not in possession of the suit property as described in the plaint schedule on the date of suit and consequently I answer this point in favour of the appellant st defendant and against the respondents to plaintiffs This was the view expressed by our <ORG> in the decision The only method by which recitals in a document not inter partes could be admitted in evidence is by examination of the executant of the document in which such recitals as to boundaries are found in this case and I answer this point also in favour of the appellant st defendant and as against the respondents to plaintiffs Consistent with my findings on the earlier points I am to hold that this second appeal has to be allowed as prayed for with costs and the judgment and decree of <ORG> at Karur in A No dated are to be set aside and the judgment and decree of <ORG> at Karur in No dated are to be restored and the suit in No on the file of Principal District Munsiff Court at Karur has to be dismissed with costs throughout and I answer this point in favour of the appellant st defendant and as against the respondents to plaintiffs In the result the second appeal is allowed as prayed for with costs The suit in No on the file of Principal District Munsif Court at Karur shall stand dismissed with costs throughout
