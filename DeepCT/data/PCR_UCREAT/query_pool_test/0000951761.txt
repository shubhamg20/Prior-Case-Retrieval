An application to aside the sale was made and an order passed setting aside the sale on December There was an appeal to the District Judge a second appeal to <ORG> and a Letters Patent Appeal from the judgment in second appeal All these appeals to which the decree holder and the auction purchaser were parties were dismissed the first appeal on November the second appeal on February and the Letters Patent Appeal on September The question arises whether this application is barred by limitation which would depend on whether as contended by the decree holder three years are allowed from the date of setting aside the sale or as contended by the auction purchaser three years from the dismissal of the Letters Patent Appeal on September One of the questions for decision is whether an appeal lay against the order passed under Order XXI Rule by the District Munsif ordering refund of the purchase money On behalf of the appellant three cases have been quoted which directly bear on this question There can be no doubt from a very large number of cases decided in this <ORG> and in other High <ORG>s that the auction purchaser can be looked upon as a representative of a judgment debtor or decree holder and further that when there is a matter in dispute between the decree holder and the judgment debtor it makes no difference that the actual application which raises the matter is made by a stranger There is very little discussion even in that judgment and the many cases referred to therein show that there was a very considerable conflict of authority on this point before <NAME> <NAME> A AWN was decided MLJ MWN MLT FB there was a conflict between the auction purchaser in execution of a money decree who was a stranger and the auction purchaser decree holder in execution of a mortgage decree There the judgment debtor in a separate suit contended that the auction purchaser had trespassed on some of his lands which had not been sold but the <ORG> found that although the lands in question were not the subject matter of the mortgage or of the decree and were not even sold yet the <NAME> had by mistake actually delivered them to the auction purchaser and that there was no trespass It was held following the <ORG> case that this was a dispute in which the judgment debtor and the decree holder were adversely interested and that it did not matter that it was the auction purchaser with whom the judgment debtor was actually contending It was therefore held that the judgment debtor should have raised this matter in execution and that a separate suit did Mad LW MWN there was a sale but before confirmation had been ordered the decree itself was set aside in appeal The sale was confirmed and an application was then put in to set aside the sale under Sections and Order XXI Rule It was held that they were and that therefore Section did apply and the matter could be gone into in execution It is not difficult think to distinguish these three cases from the present case for in all three of them it was very clear that the matters in dispute did arise in execution MLJ MWN MLT FB that a stranger purchaser at a <ORG> auction is entitled and bound to have any question relating to the satisfaction of the decree decided under Section Civil Procedure Code the judgment goes on to discuss the <ORG> case Prosonno Kumar Sanyal Kali Das Sanyal IA Sar It then refers to a recent decision of the same <ORG> in <NAME> <NAME> A Ind There is admittedly no question outstanding between the parties except that which has been decided in this appeal and to require the question to be now tried out in a regular suit would be merely to put the parties to unnecessary expense AIR All ALJ this question does seem to have been left in some uncertainty but on a general examination of the current of cases bearing on the interpretation of Section there is certainly a very strong tendency to give it a wide application and to bring within its scope questions arising between the parties to the suit and the auction purchaser As has been pointed above the matter now in dispute does to some extent relate to the discharge and satisfaction of the decree When this appeal first came up for hearing it was admitted that the Article of the Limitation Act to be applied was but the learned Advocate for the auction purchaser now suggests that the There is no direct authority but the matter has been argued on the analogy of an application under Order XXI Rule Civil Procedure Code to an application under Section Civil Procedure Code for restitution There has been a considerable conflict of authority whether applications for restitution are governed by Article or Article but the weight of authority is that they are governed by Article However there is authority in Madras for the position that applications under Section relate to execution and that Article therefore applies Apart from this change we see no ground for holding that <ORG> intended to make any departure in the procedure by which restitution is to be obtained The language of Section of the Code would cover all cases of restitution Even apart from that it is not difficult to see that restitution does arise by way of execution for in executing the decree of the <ORG> which reverses a decree of a lower <ORG> account has necessarily to be taken of any changes in the positions of the parties that have taken place since the passing of the decree that has been reversed For example if one <ORG> states that A should hand over possession to and he does so in execution and the Appellate <ORG> states that possession should be with A it is in execution of the Appellate <ORG> decree that possession is given back to A by It is difficult to apply similar reasoning to an application under Order XXI Rule Rule merely gives the auction purchaser an equitable relief by way of returning to him the money that he has already paid into <ORG> because of some order passed under Order XXI Rules to depriving him of land for which he has already paid <NAME> held that Section does not apply only to cases where a decree or order is reversed in appeal but also where an order is made of no effect by virtue of other proceedings so that when a claimant became successful in a suit filed under Order XXI Rule the <ORG> was empowered under Section to put all the parties including the auction purchaser in the same position as they would have been if the claim had been upheld in the first instance There are no grounds for holding that Article applies to an application under Order XXI Rule Assuming as was originally conceded that Article is the provision of the Limitation Act that governs this application it would certainly follow from a plain reading of Article that time began to run from the date of the passing of the original order setting aside the sale It is however argued on the analogy of orders passed on applications under Section or for the passing of a final decree that it is from the date of the decree of the final <ORG> confirming the decree of the first Court that time must be reckoned AIR All ALJ SB to the effect that The essential condition to the making of a final decree is the existence of a preliminary decree which has become conclusive between the parties When that decree is passed it is that decree and only that which can be made final between the parties Another group of applications upon which there has been considerable authority is that of applications for restitution under Section which in the opinion of most of <ORG> comes within the scope of Article As has already been pointed out an application for restitution can be looked upon as one arising in execution of a decree and some Judges while holding that Article applied have nevertheless been of opinion than such an application was akin to one in execution and so held on the analogy of Article that the <ORG> must have intended that where there were appallate decrees the decree of the final <ORG> was the decree from which time should be calculated In view of the fact that Article expressly lays down that time should be reckoned from the date of the last decree whereas Article does not Bay so it is rather difficult to argue by analogy from Article to Article The main current of authority on this point is undoubtedly to the effect that time does run from the date of the first decree The matter was very fully considered by a Full Bench of <ORG> in <NAME> <NAME> A Ind AIJ RA and the majority of the Judges found themselves unable to accept the argument that the proceedings were akin to execution proceedings and that the same principle that time should be reckoned from the date of the final <ORG> decree should be followed If it was the operative decree of the final <ORG> that had to be taken into account in reckoning the time allowed for applying for a final decree then for the same reason it would be the decree of the final Court of Appeal that should be taken into account in reckoning the time for restitution proceedings Their Lordships there pointed out that as in India an original decree is not suspended by the presentation of an appeal nor is its operation interrupted when the decree on appeal is one of dismissal and that as consideration failed at the date of the first decree the mere fact that an appeal had been filed did not suspend the cause of action and that throughout the pendency of the proceedings in <ORG>s time was running against the plaintiff This case is of very great importance and has been discussed in all the cases relating to applications for restitution whichever way Courts have eventually decided It has been taken as an authority by the Allahabad and Calcutta <ORG> with regard to restitution proceedings on the ground that as the section clearly says that the period of limitation under Article is three years from the time when the right to apply accrues time must be calculated from the date on which the right accrued because the cause of action is not interrupted by the subsequent filing of an appeal The suit was filed more than three years from the date of the original decree but less than three years from the date of the appellate decree In that case the Judges felt themselves bound by the <ORG> decision just referred to They say that In construing the provisions of the Limitation Act equitable considerations are out of place and the strict grammatical meaning of the words is the only safe guide In this view we are of opinion that the right to apply accrued as soon as the order of the District Judge was made in August confirming the sale and that as the present application was not made within three years from that date it has been rightly held that the application was barred by limitation LR MWN CLJ MLT LW PC had no application to Article and that it would be strange if the basis for calculating the limitation under Article differed from that under Article that time began to run from the date of the first decree and not from the date of the appellate decree Juscurn Boid Pirthi Chand Lal Ind LW MLT MWN deals with precisely the point raised in this application yet it seems that the same principles have to be applied in this case as in those just quoted The present application was a simple one under Order XXI Rule for the return of money and the right to make that application accrued immediately the order setting aside the sale was made It is moreover a very old one and it was decided on purely equitable considerations An alternative argument has been put forward on behalf of the appellant that as he joined with the decree holder in preferring the appeals he could not at the same time apply for a refund of the purchase money and that it could not be said that the right accrued to the applicant in pursuing the strictly alternative relief to have the sale upheld The learned Subordinate Judge in appeal disposed of this argument very summarily by saying that he was unable to follow the reasoning and that if the appellant chose to take the matter in appeal it was his own fault and he did so at his own risk The appellant had two remedies and there was no reason why he should not have adopted both at the same time one being kept pending until the other was disposed of He had a choice and must accept the consequences of having made the wrong one In result the appeal is dismissed with costs
