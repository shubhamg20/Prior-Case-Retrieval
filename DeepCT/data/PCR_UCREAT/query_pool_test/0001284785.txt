In this case the plaintiff as assignee claims Rs Then there were certain words which it was agreed between the parties were added at the time that letter was written in Guzrati and the correct translation was in these terms On the sale proceeds being received in hand brokerage will be paid He had the opportunity of introducing such a purchaser and thus qualifying for his brokerage for days only Now there is no question as to the law which governs such a matter as this There he says quoting from Lord <NAME> Laws of England In order to entitle the agent to receive hisremuneration he must have carried out that which he bargained to do or at any rate must have substantially done so and all conditions imposed by the contract must have been fulfilled After due consideration he has accepted the evidence of <NAME> the purchaser and rejected that of the defendant and in a case such as this where the matter depends to a large extent upon the verbal evidence of the witnesses in my judgment this Court ought not to interfere with the decision of the learned Judge save on very clear grounds in other words unless it is clear that a miscarriage of justice has taken place The Judge who tried the case has had the advantage which we have not had of seeing and hearing the witnesses an advantage which in my experience it is almost impossible to overestimate In this case I am not prepared to say that the learned Judge has decided wrongly on the contrary I think there is sufficient evidence to justify the decision at which he arrived On the material points he has accepted the evidence of <NAME> and rejected that of the defendant and in passing I may say that the comments made upon the evidence of the defendant by the learned Counsel for the plaintiff were not without justification and <NAME> used to come and see me often and he got me into this scrape But it is said that there is nothing to show that <NAME> introduced the purchaser and performed his part of the contract within the specified time days there is evidence that this must have been done within the time limit because we find that on the th June days from the date of the broker letter <NAME> wrote to the defendant in the following terms As per our conversation with your Mr <NAME> we intend to purchase the above mills together with the land connected with it at a cost price of Rs Then he set out the condition He must have seen the defendant that day and such letter contains an offer of Rs The main reason however which weighs with me is that the learned Judge has had to deal with conflicting verbal evidence on a question of fact and after seeing and hearing the witnesses he has come to the conclusion that the truth lies on the side of <NAME> and not on the side of the defendant and in such a case in my judgment this Court should not interfere unless it is clear that he has come to a wrong conclusion A further point has been raised namely that the plaintiff in any event cannot recover more than the commission on the amount actually received by the defendant in cash The purchase was completed on the th of September when the purchaser paid Rs The onus of proving this is on the plaintiffs This is of importance in the present case for in regard to the particular question on which I mainly rest my judgment viz There is no finding on this particular point It was however not necessary to put this specifically in issue since the onus of proving all facts necessary to establish the claim was on the plaintiffs and the defendant put in issue the allegation that the purchase was effected by <ORG> in terms of the agreement according to the conditions of which alone he was entitled to a commission It has been argued for the respondent that it is sufficient if a purchaser was secured within days even if the actual purchase was completed later This the appellant denies contending that commission was payable only in the event of the transaction being completed which it was not within days and nextly that brokerage was only payable on the sale proceeds being received in cash which was not the case within this period He was again asked about this matter in re examination and he replied that he did not remember the date nor even the month when <NAME> spoke to him about this letter and that he could not say whether it was before or after this letter that <NAME> spoke to him Had it been the fact that it was due to <NAME> intervention that the first letter was written it does not seem to me possible that the witness could have forgotten it His answer must have been in that case that he must have seen <NAME> first for before seeing him he had known nothing of the defendant or of his property He will not commit himself to this and I think for the reason that he had not then seen <NAME> but had learnt about the property through an advertisement in the <ORG> The purchaser also in his evidence says I saw the Exchange <ORG> and then I wrote that letter not that he had seen <NAME> meanwhile or at all There is no specific evidence that <NAME> secured the purchaser between the th and th or the conclusion of the period allowed to him There is some general evidence that he introduced the purchaser which in any case is scarcely accurate if the first communication of the th to which I have referred was without his intervention Doubtless in a case of this kind great weight must be attached to the judgement of the learned Judge who heard the case but in the present instance we have no finding on the specific point and the uncorroborated evidence of the purchaser on which the learned Judge has relied is upon the most favourable view consistent with the fact of work done after the limited period and is in my opinion in conflict with and unsupported by the documentary evidence in the case and the inferences to be derived there from As stated the first letter of the th indicates that it was the advertisement which first put the parties in communication There is no mention of <NAME> as broker in any of the letters until we get to the letter of th November which is of doubtful admissibility against the appellant But on the merits the letter comes too late to be of value and is open to the suspicion that evidence was then being made for the claim by <NAME> which followed it in January It is remarkable also that there is no letter or other document by the broker which establishes his claim Finally there is evidence that the purchaser <ORG> took a commission of per cent on the entire sale proceeds of Its He further granted a receipt for the same on which express reference is made to amount of brokerage For these reasons I would allow this appeal It is possible that what may have happened is that the defendant advertised his property and then <NAME> coming in this way to know of it got the agreement of agency from the defendant It is however not necessary for me to hold anything more than that the plaintiffs have not established that <NAME> earned his commission within the terms of the agreement and I would therefore decree this appeal with costs and dismiss this suit with costs As regards the question whether we should interfere in appeal with questions of fact I will only say this that if after argument the Court has a conviction that the judgment under appeal is erroneous it should not be affirmed and this is not the less so because the judgment raised a question of fact I went thrice to your office but unfortunately could not find you there to be deposited there out as earnest money and the balance to be paid after one month if on trial working meanwhile the mill turned out to be satisfactory On the th January the Solicitors of the plaintiff wrote to the defendant and demanded immediate payment of Rs He asserted that the plaintiff had failed to secure a purchaser within the prescribed time and that the mill had been sold without any concern with him and he added that the seller had already paid brokerage on the transaction The plaintiff thereupon instituted this suit on the th June The defendant asserted that the sale had taken place without the intervention of the plaintiff as broker and repudiated the claim as entirely unfounded I do not hold that the plaintiff was bound to complete the transaction within this period in my view of the contract the plaintiff would be entitled to the commission if within the time prescribed he produced a person able ready and willing to enter into the transaction with the defendant on the terms prescribed by the latter and the plaintiff must within that period notify his principal that he had secured such a person If these principles are borne in mind there is no escape from the conclusion that the plaintiff cannot be awarded a decree merely on the finding that the sale was effected through his instrumentality If the case were before a Jury the Court would have to instruct them that to find a verdict for plaintiff they must find that plaintiff procured a purchaser able and willing to buy on the terms stated in the writing that he notified defendant of the fact and that this was done within the days prescribed There is no trace in the correspondence already summarised that he had done so This no doubt is not conclusive proof that he had not met the broker on or before the th June but there is no specific evidence upon which I can act that the two had met before that date I am not unmindful that the purchaser asserts that he first offered Rs Mr <NAME> in the course of his able argument for the respondent properly emphasised the fact that Mr Justice <NAME> who had the opportunity to see the witnesses which we have not has believed the purchaser in preference to the defendant and he has argued that in a case of this description where there is a conflict of oral testimony <ORG> should not reverse the finding of <ORG> This contention raises a question of considerable importance as to the duty and functions of <ORG> in this country When such evidence consists entirely or even principally of the oral testimony of witnesses the appellant is at a special disadvantage But it is worthy of note that Lord <NAME> refers with approval to the judgment delivered by <NAME> in <ORG> in the case of <NAME> <NAME> Ch <NAME>Ch which sets out the limitations of the rule Even where the appeal turns on a question of fact <ORG> has to bear in mind that its duty is to rehear the case and the <ORG> must reconsider the materials before the Judge with such other materials as it may have decided to admit The <ORG> must then make up its own mind not disregarding the judgment appealed from but carefully weighing and considering it and not shrinking from overruling it if on full consideration the <ORG> comes to the conclusion that the judgment is wrong When as often happens much turns on the relative credibility of witnesses who have been examined and cross examined before the Judge the <ORG> is sensible of the great advantage he has had in seeing and hearing them It is often very difficult to estimate correctly the relative credibility of witnesses from written depositions and when the question arises which witness is to be believed rather than another and that question turns on manner and demeanour <ORG> always is and must be guided by the impression made on the Judge who saw the witnesses But there may obviously be other circumstances quite apart from manner and demeanour which may show whether a statement is credible or not and these circumstances may warrant the <ORG> in differing from the Judge even on a question of fact turning on the credibility of witnesses whom the <ORG> has not seen In the case in which these observations were made <ORG> <NAME> Rigby <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> allowed the appeal although the appeal turned on a question of fact We may also bear in mind the observation of Lord Chelmsford in Tayammaul Sashachalla Naikar I A at Sar <NAME> the advantage the Judge of <ORG> possesses in forming a correct opinion of the credit due to the witnesses does not relieve <ORG> from the duty of examining the whole evidence and forming for itself an opinion upon the whole case But the parties to the cause are entitled as well on questions of fact as on questions of law to demand the decision of <ORG> though as James <NAME> said in Bigsby <NAME> Ch at <NAME>Ch if we are to accept as final the decision of the <ORG> of first instance in every case where there is a conflict of evidence our labours would be very much lightered But even in other cases it is undoubtedly the duty of <ORG> to weigh conflicting evidence and to draw its own inferences and conclusions though it should always bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and should make due allowance in this respect We may also bear in mind the fact that although as an ordinary rule <ORG> does not interfere with concurrent judgments of the <ORG>s below on questions of fact instances are by no means rare where their Lordships have examined the whole evidence formed for themselves an opinion on the entire case and reversed the unanimous decision of the two <ORG>s in India on a question of fact <NAME> <NAME> I A <NAME> <NAME> I It is not necessary for the present purpose to consider whether any general principle is deducible from the expressions used by their Lordships as to the circumstances under which they will depart from the rule ordinarily observed by them such as that the very clearest proof is shown that the decision is erroneous that the <ORG> is clearly satisfied that there has been miscarriage in the appreciation of evidence that it is manifestly clear from the probabilities that the <ORG> below was wrong that the case is very extraordinary that a strong case must be made out before the <ORG> would recommend reversal that it must very clearly appear that the conclusion is very plainly erroneous that there has been some miscarriage in respect of a presumption to which too much weight was given that very definite and explicit grounds must be assigned for interference that there is so strong a preponderance of testimony that the <ORG> can confidently pronounce the decision to be wrong and other expressions of like import There is further the unexplained fact that the purchaser received Rs as brokerage he cannot explain why the sum was described by this obviously inappropriate term it is extremely improbable that the defendant would have made a present of this sum to the purchaser if he had really to pay Rs There is the further significant fact that the claim for brokerage was not put forward till the th January though if the plaintiff is to be believed he had earned it before the th June and the sale had been actually completed on the th September Finally the case for the plaintiff is certainly not improved by the letter alleged to have been written on the th November which plainly bears the appearance of an attempt to create evidence for future use After the most careful and anxious consideration of the entire evidence on the record and the circumstances of the case I have arrived at the conclusion that the plaintiff has failed to establish that he has earned the commission claimed in terms of the contract and that the decree in his favour cannot be supported In my opinion the appeal should be allowed and the suit dismissed with costs throughout The result is that in view of the opinion expressed by the majority of the <ORG> this appeal will be allowed the judgment of the <ORG> of first instance set aside and the plaintiff suit dismissed with costs both of the <ORG> of first instance and of this appeal
