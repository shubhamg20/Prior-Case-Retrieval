During the relevant previous year the assessee had valued its opening stock on the basis of costs plus overheads which was the method adopted by the assessee in the years prior thereto so that the value of the closing stock for the year ending March was carried forward as the value of the opening stock on April The assessee however decided to change its method of valuation by valuing the stock at cost price only excluding the overheads The assessee accordingly valued it closing stock for the assessment year in question i as on March at cost price The Income tax Officer increased the gross profit rate in view of the difference in the method of valuation of opening stock and closing stock The assessee took the matter in appeal before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner It is not in dispute that under section of the Income tax Act the assessee can adopt a method of valuation which has to be followed by it regularly For the earlier previous years however the assessee determined the cost price by adding overheads to the cost of the stock while in the relevant assessment year it decided to change this methods by determining the cost price without taking into account overheads The <ORG> has not dealt with this aspect viz In other words the change in the method of valuation according to the <ORG> should commence with is to be adopted for valuing the opening stock of nay previous year by the new method which is to be adopted for valuing the closing stock as well Mr <NAME> has drawn our attention to a booklet called Valuation of stock and Work in Progress Normally Accepted Accounting Principles brought out by <ORG> and written by <NAME> At page of this booklet there is a discussion about change from one valid basis to another valid basis It is thus clear that irrespective of the basis adopted for valuation in the earlier years the assessee has the option to change the method of valuation of the closing stock at cost or market price whichever is lower provided the change is bona fide and followed regularly thereafter The change therefore has to be effected by adopting the new method for valuing the closing stock which will in its turn become the value of the opening stock of the next year In the case before <ORG> also the valuation of opening stock had been done by the company on the basis of valuation for the closing stock to direct cost i cost without overheads This change in method was made bona fide and the assessee said that it would be adopting this method consistently in the future just as in the present case The court in that case held The change was a bona fide one and was a permanent arrangement which was to be followed year after year the change would have to be accepted notwithstanding the fact that during the assessment year in question which was the first year when the change of method was brought about a prejudice or detriment might be caused to the revenue because the opening stock was valued at total cost while stock was valued at direct cost Before <ORG> also the assessee was valuing its closing stock in the past years by what is known as total cost method in which the proportionate over heads for administrative expenses selling expenses and interest in stock valuation were taken into account for the assessment year in question the assessee adopted the works cost system where the administrative overheads were not taken into account In the case before <ORG> both the opening and closing stock were undervalued This decision has no application to the question before us which deals with the change method of valuation and the manner in which such change has to be brought about Whenever there is a change in the method of valuation There is bound to be some distortion in the calculation of profit in the year in which the change takes place The only question is whether the opening stock is also required to be revalued by excluding all overhead expenses when the assessee has been permitted to revise the method of valuing the closing stock for that year as the assessee has decided to adopt this new method of valuation henceforth We are not called upon to decide whether the method adopted for valuing the closing stock is in accordance with law and or accounting practice
