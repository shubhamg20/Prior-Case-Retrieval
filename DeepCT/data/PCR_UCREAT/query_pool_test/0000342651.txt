It declared the plaintiffs title to the land and directed that they would recover khas possession on evicting the defendants therefrom The defendants thereupon preferred an appeal The learned Subordinate Judge who dealt with that appeal dismissed the plaintiffs claim holding that although he found in favour of the plaintiffs on the merits the decree of <ORG> was to be reversed and the suit dismissed on the ground that notices under Section Act were neither sufficient nor properly served The plaintiffs have then preferred this second appeal and on their behalf the findings of the Subordinate Judge both on the question of sufficiency of the notices as also on the question of their service have been challenged in this appeal As regards the sufficiency of the notices what has been found against the plaintiffs by the Subordinate Judge is that the notices purported to have been signed by certain persons as am mukhtears on behalf of certain ladies and that it had not been proved in the case that the persons who purported to sign on behalf of the said ladies as such am mukhtears had been duly authorized by the said ladies to issue the said notices The learned Subordinate Judge has found that upon the evidence in the case proper execution of the am mukhtearnamas had not been duly proved and further more that although in the am mukhtearnamas power was given to the am mukhtears to sue in ejectment there was nothing said conferring any authority to the am mukhtears to issue notices to quit As regards this matter it is sufficient for us to say that in the written statement that was filed on behalf of the defendants no question as to the want of a power of this character in the am mukhtearnamas or as to the am mukhtearnamas not having been duly executed by the ladies appears to have been raised If it was the defendants desire to contest the validity of the notices upon grounds such as these it was clearly their duty to put forward their objection on this head definitely and specifically in the written statement in order that the plaintiffs could have produced necessary evidence showing due and proper execution of the am mukhtearnamas and the fact that the power to issue notices on behalf of the ladies was conferred thereby Moreover even if there was any defect in the am mukhtearnamas as regards these matters the plaintiffs could have proved that the notices were issued under authority duly given by the ladies because the law does not say that such authority must necessarily be given in writing It may also be mentioned that the power to sue in ejectment should ordinarily be taken to include power to take up such action as may be necessary as preliminaries to the institution of such a suit <NAME> it appears denied in the written statement that there was any service of notice on him On behalf of the plaintiffs it was proved that notice was sent by registered post and an acknowledgment purporting to have been signed by <NAME> and received back through the post office was produced and proved in the case In that case their Lordships quoting the decision in the case of <ORG> <ORG> observed that if a letter properly directed containing a notice to quit is proved to have been put into the post office it is presumed that the letter reached its destination at the proper time according to the regular course of business in the post office and was received by the person to whom it was addressed The notice meant for <NAME> was also sent per registered post and served on one <NAME> <NAME> has been examined on behalf of the defendants and he has said that he forgot to make over the notice to <NAME> The postal peon who delivered the letter to <NAME> was examined but he was unable to say that he made over the notice to <NAME> at the request of <NAME> He held that her evidence to that effect was not forthcoming and it should be taken that the notice was not served on <NAME> The notices that were given in this case were addressed to all the joint tenants and copies of such notice are alleged to have been served upon the joint tenants severally In view of the fact that we have found that service of notice to quit upon <NAME> had been established applying to the case the dictum of <ORG> referred to above it follows as a matter of course that the other joint tenants including <NAME> had been served with notice On examination of the facts of that case however it appears that all that has been laid down in that case is that the notice in order to give rise to this presumption must be addressed to all the joint tenants and that where no notice was addressed to one of of the joint tenants the mere service of the notice on the other joint tenants is not sufficient notice to quit according to law In the present case the notices that were issued were addressed to all the joint tenants But this cannot be possibly true as I have seen that <NAME> had also some land to the north of the road and his brother <NAME> boitakhana was situated there It has been held in the case of <NAME> <NAME> Cal The question whether the notice and the suit covered the entire tenancy or whether they have left out a part of it which is in the defendants occupation will have to be re investigated and in view of the fact that it was not specifically raised in the pleadings and there is not much indication in the judgment of <ORG> showing that it was canvassed there we think that while we shall make an order for remand to the lower appellate Court for proper investigation of that question and for a clear finding on it we shall give the parties an opportunity to adduce such further materials as they may desire to do in connexion with this question All other questions that arose in the suit have now been concluded and the question referred to above is only question that will be left open for consideration by the learned Subordinate Judge On arriving at his finding on that question he will proceed to dispose of the appeal in accordance with law Costs of this appeal will abide the result
