State Law imposing tax on goods carried by road or inland waterways Constitutionaly of Constitution of India Arts The appellants contended that the Act violated the freedom of trade guaranteed by Art The respondent urged that taxing laws were not governed by Part XIII which contained Arts that the Act violated Art The freedom of trade commerce and intercourse guaranteed by Art was wider than that contained in Of the Government of India Act and it included freedom from tax laws also Article provides that the flow of trade shall run smooth and unhampered by any restriction either at the boundaries of the States or at any other points inside the States themselves and if any Act imposes any direct restrictions on the movement of goods it attracts the provisions of Art and its validity can be sustained only if it satisfied the requirements of Art did not mean freedom from taxation simpliciter but only from the erection of trade barriers tariff walls and imposts which had a deleterious effect on the free flow of trade commerce and intercourse Article guarantees freedom in its widest amplitude freedom from prohibition control burden or impediment in commercial intercourse The freedom includes not only freedom from discriminative tariffs and trade barriers but also from all taxation on commercial intercourse Part XIII of the Constitution places restrictions upon the legislative power granted by Arts The Assam Taxation on goods carried by road and inland waterways Act contravenes Art Article means freedom from all restrictions including tax laws Article may also refer to tax in certain circumstances in cases other than those covered by Art In Article freedom of trade only means freedom from trade barriers it does not mean freedom from taxation Article uses the words in the public interest It is likely that if the Constitution makers wanted to put a bar on the taxation power it would have been placed in Part XII and not left to be inferred from Art Article deals with preference and discrimination between one <ORG> and another indicates that the freedom there includes freedom from taxation Article a deals with discrimination and not with taxation simpliciter Article a assumes that there is an existing tax on goods which is not levied under a There is an intermediate position also Article is concerned with the right of passage generally with respect to trade and commerce and Art Article assumes legislation of <ORG> under the entries relating to trade and commerce The Judgment of <NAME> <NAME> was delivered by <NAME> <NAME> The judgment of <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> of the Constitution impugn the constitutionality of the Assam Taxation on Goods Carried by Roads or Inland Waterways Act Assam Act XIII of which hereinafter will be referred to as the Act Thereupon the appellants obtained the certificates that the cases involved substantial questions of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution The appellants and the petitioners will in the course of this judgment be referred to for the sake of convenience as the appellants The sale of tea inside Assam bears a very small proportion to the tea produced and manufactured by the appellants Thus the bulk of tea produced and manufactured is carried out of Assam either for internal consumption in India or for export abroad <ORG> passed the Act which received the assent of the Governor of Assam on April and came into force on and from June The purpose of the Act is to levy taxes on certain goods carried by road or inland waterways in the <ORG> of Assam On June the second respondent the Commissioner of Taxes Assam in exercise of the powers conferred upon him by subs of of the Act published a notification in <ORG> bearing date June by which he notified for general information that the return under the aforesaid Act and the rules made thereunder for the period commencing June to September should be furnished by October The said notification also demanded the furnishing of quarterly returns before January and April for the quarters ending December and March respectively The appellants in some of the cases in pursuance of demand notices submitted returns to the third respondent the Superintendent of Taxes in the prescribed form in respect of tea despatched and carried up to September under protest They also paid the tax demanded under protest of the Constitution challenging the validity of the said Act and praying for the issue of a writ of mandamus directing the respondents to forbear from giving effect to the provisions of the Act and the notification issued under the Act and or a writ of prohibition or any other appropriate writ restraining them from taking steps under the provisions of the Act The appellants challenged the validity of the Act mainly on the grounds that the Act rules and the notifications under the Act were ultra vires the Constitution because the Act was repugnant to the provisions of Art The impugned Act was also challenged on the ground that it was discriminatory and thus void under Art The competence of <ORG> to legislate on the subject was also questioned It was denied by the <ORG> that the Act or the rules made thereunder or the notifications issued thereunder were ultra vires the Constitution or that the Act contravened the provisions of Art The case of the respondents was that the Act was in pith and substance a legislation to levy tax on certain classes and types of goods carried by road or inland waterways strictly within entry no of the <ORG> List Two separate but concurring judgments were delivered by <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> The learned Chief Justice in the course of his judgment held that the Act contemplated imposition of a tax on transport or carriage of goods within the Meaning of entry of List II and did not amount to interference with the freedom of trade and commerce within the meaning of Art He also held that the impost levied by the Act was not in the nature of an excise duty and that there was no substance in the contention that it encroached upon entry of the Union List On the crucial question arising in this case his conclusion was that taxation per se has not the effect of abridging or curtailing the freedom contemplated by Art and restrict the powers of <ORG> and <ORG> in the matter of legislation under entries of List of List and of List III and that restrictions properly so called on the movement of goods and traffic must find their justification from the provisions of Part XIII of the Constitution that the impugned Act made provision for taxation which did not directly impinge upon the freedom of trade commerce and intercourse within the meaning of Art His view also was that in some cases taxation may have the effect of placing restrictions on movement of goods and traffic and if it has that effect it comes within the mischief of Art In the result his conclusion was that the impugned Act in its pith and substance fell within the ambit of entry of List was that there was no proof forthcoming of any real discrimination between persons and things From the judgment of <ORG> the appellants have come up in appeal on certificates granted by <ORG> They raise the same questions as arise for determination in the three appeals from the decision of <ORG> of the Constitution that the legislation was beyond the legislative competence of <ORG> and was not authorised by entry in List II that the tea industry was a controlled industry as declared by <ORG> and directly came under entry of List that it was a colourable piece of legislation which in its true effect was a levy of a duty of excise which could only be done by the <ORG> <ORG> and finally that it contravened Art Restriction in the context of Part XIII meant legislation which had the effect of impeding the free flow of goods and traffic by erection of tariff walls for example a tariff wall if erected by a <ORG> may be justiciable but not legislation simply imposing a tax for purposes of revenue He further contended that Part XII of the Constitution is a self contained part dealing with finance etc even as Part XIII is a selfcontained part dealing with trade commerce and intercourse within the territory of India According to his contention freedom in Part XIII meant freedom from discriminatory taxation and freedom from trade barriers The Advocate General of the several States who appeared in this case supported the viewpoint stressed by the learned Attorney General It has not been and it could not be contended that the generality of the expressions used in Art All parties are agreed that trade commerce and intercourse throughout the territory of India have been emphatically declared by the Constitution to be free but there is a wide divergence of views on the answer to the question free from what It has been contended on behalf of the appellants that the answer to this question must be that trade commerce and intercourse throughout India shall be free from everything including taxation In order fully to appreciate the implications of the provisions of Part XIII of the Constitution it is necessary to bear in mind the history and background of those provisions No Provincial Legislature or Government shall a by virtue of the entry in the Provincial Legislative List relating to trade and commerce within the Province or the entry in that list relating to the production supply and distribution of commodities have power to pass any law or take any executive action prohibiting or restricting the entry into or export from the Province of goods of any class or description or by virtue of anything in this Act have power to impose any tax cess toll or due which as between goods manufactured or produced in the Province and similar goods not so manufactured or produced discriminates in favour of the former or which in the case of goods manufactured or produced outside the Province discriminates between goods manufactured or produced in one locality and similar goods manufactured or produced in another locality Any law passed in contravention of this section shall to the extent of the contravention be invalid It will be noticed that the prohibition contained in the section quoted above applied only to Provincial Governments and Provincial Legislatures with reference to entries in the Provincial Legislative List relating to trade and commerce within the Province and to production supply and distribution of commodities It also dealt with the power to impose taxes etc and prohibited discrimination against goods manufactured or produced outside a Province or goods produced in different localities There were a large number of them with varying degrees of sovereignty vested in them Those rulers had broadly speaking the trappings of a Sovereign State with power to impose taxes and to regulate the flow of trade commerce and intercourse Between the years and almost all the Indian States entered into engagements with <ORG> and ultimately merged their individualities into India as one political unit with the result that what was called British India broadly speaking became under the Constitution Part A States and subject to certain exceptions not relevant to our purpose the Native States became Part States It is in the background of these facts and circumstances that we have to determine the ambit of the freedom contemplated by Art On the other hand taxes on goods and passengers carried by road or inland waterways come under entry of List II <ORG> List The sovereign <ORG> in some cases the <ORG> in other cases the <ORG> has the inherent power to impose taxes in order to raise revenue for purposes of <ORG> This power of the <ORG> to raise finances for Government purposes has been dealt with by Part XII of the Constitution which contains the total prohibition of levy or collection of tax except by authority of law Art In short Part XII is a self contained series of provisions relating to the finances of the <ORG> and of the <ORG>s and their interrelation and adjustments ignoring the provisions in Chapter of that Part relating to borrowing and Chapter relating to property contracts etc But it has been argued on behalf of the appellants that the pro would show that it is divided into two parts viz There is a prohibition against <ORG> as also against the <ORG> of a <ORG> making any law giving preference to one <ORG> over another or making or authorising the making of any discrimination between one <ORG> and another are with reference to any entry relating to trade and commerce in any of the Lists in the Seventh Schedule that is to say entry in List entry in List II and entry in List III of the Seventh Schedule Hence any legislation under those entries which has the effect of directly interfering with trade commerce and intercourse being free throughout the territory of India has to be struck down as infringing the provisions of Art In such a situation <ORG> has been armed with the power to grant preference to one <ORG> over another or to make a discrimination as between two and more <ORG>s if the Law dealing with such a situation declares that it is necessary to do so in order to deal with an emergency like the one referred to above has not been very accurately worded inasmuch as the non obstante clause with which the Article opens has reference only to Art which empowers <ORG> to impose by law restrictions on the freedom of trade commerce or intercourse inter <ORG> or intra<ORG> in public interest But the non obstante clause is immediately followed by reference not only to <ORG> but also to the <ORG> of a <ORG> which are armed with the power of giving preference or making discrimination as aforesaid in respect of the entries relating to trade and commerce in any of the lists in the Seventh Schedule But as the present controversy is not concerned with the freedom of intercourse as distinguished from the freedom of trade and commerce no more need be said about that omission In my opinion there is no warrant for such an extreme position If that were so all laws of taxation relating to sale and purchase of goods on carriage of goods and commodities men and animals from one place to another both inter State and intraState would come within the purview of Art That will be putting too great an impedi ment to the power of taxation vested in the States and reduce the States limited sovereignty under the Constitution to a mere fiction It cannot therefore be said that taxation in every case must mean an impediment or restraint against free flow of trade and commerce of the Constitution is that the very connotation of taxation is the power of the <ORG> to raise money for public purposes by compelling the payment by persons both natural and juristic of monies earned or possessed by them by virtue of the facilities and protection afforded by the <ORG> as already indicated has been treated as a Part dealing with the sovereign power of the <ORG> to impose taxes which must always mean imposing burdens on citizens and others in public interest If a law is passed by the <ORG> imposing a tax which in its true nature and effect is meant to impose an impediment to the free flow of trade commerce and intercourse for example by imposing a high tariff wall or by preventing imports into or exports out of a <ORG> such a law is outside the significance of taxation as such but assumes the character of a trade barrier which it was the intention of the Constitution makers to abolish by Part XIII The objections against the contention that taxation was included within the prohibition contained in Part XIII may thus be summarised Taxation as such always implies that it is in public interest Our Constitution has laid the foundations of a welfare <ORG> which means very much expanding the scope of the activities of Government and administration thus making it necessary for the <ORG> to impose taxes on a much larger scale and in much wider fields Laws relating to taxation which is essentially a legislative function of the <ORG> will become justiciable and every time a taxation law is challenged as unconstitutional the <ORG> will have to satisfy the courts a course which will seriously affect the division of powers on which modern constitutions including ours are based before it was repealed in contained reference to taxation for certain purposes mentioned in those Articles while recognising the power of a <ORG> <ORG> to tax goods imported inter <ORG> insists that a similar tax is imposed on goods manufactured or produced within the <ORG> The Article thus brings out the clear distinction between taxation as such for the purpose of revenue and taxation for purposes of making discrimination or giving preference both of which are treated by the Constitution as impediments to free trade and commerce In other words so long as the impost was not in the nature of an impediment to the free flow of goods and commodities between one <ORG> and another including in this expression <ORG> territories also its legality was not subject to an attack based on the provisions of Part XIII Article only left intact such power of taxation but contained the inhibition that such taxes shall not be permitted to have the effect of impeding the free flow of goods and commodities Article with which Part XIII commences contains the crucial words shall be free and provides the key to the solution of the problems posed by the whole Part The freedom declared by this Article is not an absolute freedom from all legislation As already indicated the several entries in the three Lists would suggest that both <ORG> and <ORG> <ORG> have been given the power to legislate in respect of trade commerce and intercourse but it is equally clear that legislation should not have the effect of putting impediments in the way of free flow of trade and commerce The <ORG> and <ORG> therefore have the power to legislate by way of taxation in respect of trade commerce and intercourse so as not to erect trade barriers tariff walls or imposts which have a deleterious effect on the free flow of trade commerce and intercourse That freedom has further been circumscribed by the power vested in <ORG> or in <ORG> to impose restrictions in the public interest <ORG> has further been authorised to legislate in the way of giving preference or making discrimination in certain strictly limited circumstances indicated in el does not mean freedom from taxation simpliciter but does mean freedom from taxation which has the effect of directly impeding the free flow of trade commerce and intercourse the freedom envisaged in Art even discriminatory or preferential legisla tion may be made by <ORG> for the purpose of dealing with an emergency like a scarcity of goods in any part of India Art reasonable restrictions may be imposed by the Legislature of a State in the public interest Art non discriminatory taxes may be imposed by the Legislature of a State on goods imported from another State or other States if similar taxes are imposed on goods produced or manufactured in that State Art a and lastly restrictions imposed by existing laws have been continued except in so far as the President may by order otherwise direct Art includes within its large sweep taxation simpliciter I now proceed to discuss the terms of the impugned Act in order to find out whether in the light of the discussion above any of its provisions are liable to be struck down as unconstitutional because they infringe Art The Act as the preamble shows is intended to impose a tax on certain goods carried by road or inland waterways Dealer has been defined in as under Dealer means a person who owns jute in bales before it is carried by motor vehicle cart trolley boat animal and human agency or any other means except railways or airways and includes his agent It is not necessary to set out the rate of taxes aforesaid because no argument was advanced to the effect that they were oppressive or excessive The tax on manufactured tea in chests is to be paid by the producer which term includes the person in charge of the garden where tea is produced The tax on jute carried in bales is made realisable from the dealer which means a person who owns the jute in bales Section requires every producer and dealer to furnish returns of such tea or such jute as have been made liable to tax under as aforesaid Section makes provision for licensing of balers which means persons who own or possess a pressing machine for the compression of jute into bales Section lays down the procedure of assessment and the procedure for cancellation of assessment in certain cir cumstances Section lays down the procedure for assessment in such cases as have escaped assessment or there has been an evasion of the tax It will be seen from the bare summary of the relevant provisions of the statute that it is a taxing statute simpliciter without the least suggestion even of any attempt at discrimination against dealers and producers outside the State of Assam or of preference in favour of those inside the State It has not been suggested that the Act imposes a heavy burden on the dealer or the producer as the case may be On the terms of the Statute it cannot be said that it is intended to put obstacles or impediments in the way of free flow of traffic in respect of jute and tea of the Constitution it is necessary to advert to the other contentions raised on behalf of the appellants We have therefore to address ourselves to the question whether or not it is covered by any of the entries in List of the Seventh Schedule Entry in its very terms Taxes on goods and passengers carried by rail or in inland waterways completely covers the impugned Act There is no occasion in this case to take recourse to the doctrine of pith and substance inasmuch as the Act is a simple piece of taxing statute meant to tax transport of goods in this case jute and tea by road or on inland waterways In my opinion it is a very simple case of taxation completely covered by entry but the argument against the competence of <ORG> has been sought to be supported by the subsidiary contention that though in form it is a tax on the transport of goods within the terms of entry in substance it is an imposition of excise duty within the meaning of entry in List of the Seventh Schedule but in my opinion there is no substance in this contention for the simple reason that so long as jute or tea is not sought to be transported from one place to another within the <ORG> or outside the <ORG> no tax is sought to be levied by the Act <NAME> on sale of goods but was in substance a duty of excise in these terms This argument however overlooks the fact that under <NAME> ii the producer or manufacturer became liable to pay the tax not because he produced or manufactured the goods but because he sold the goods In other words the tax was laid on the producer or manufacturer only qua seller and not qua manufacturer or producer as pointed out in <NAME> case If the goods produced or manufactured in Bihar were destroyed by fire before sale the manufacturer or producer would not have been liable to pay any tax under read with second proviso As <NAME> said in <NAME> case supra at the manufacturer or producer would be liable if at all to a sales tax because he sells and not because he manufactures or produces and he would be free from liability if he chose to give away everything which came from his factory It must therefore be held that the Act does what it sets out to do namely to impose a tax on goods carried by road or on inland waterways It was argued that the tea industry was a controlled one within the competence <ORG> The Tea Act declared that it was expedient in the public interest that the <ORG> should take the tea industry under its control With a view to controlling the industry in public interest the Act established <ORG> With the objectives aforesaid Chapter III lays down provisions for the control over the extension of tea cultivation and Chapter IV deals with provisions for control over the export of tea and tea seed There are no provisions of the Tea Act which can be said to come into conflict with the provisions of the impugned Act A third line of argument against the constitutionality of the Act was that it is extra territorial in its operation in so far as it purports to tax producers and dealers who may not be residents of the State of Assam This argument has been advanced in the interest of the appellants and petitioners from West Bengal who have to carry their goods by road or on waterways passing through the territory of Assam from one part of West Bengal to another It is not denied that there is some real and substantial nexus to support the taxing statute but it is contended that relatively to the whole journey to be covered by the merchandise the portion of the territory of Assam covered in that journey is very small If goods belonging to or carried by the appellants traverse any of the territory of Assam the taxation cannot be successfully assailed on this ground once it is held that it was within the legislative competence of the <ORG> imposing the tax in question to where <NAME> speaking for the majority of the <ORG> has examined the theory of nexus with reference to a large body of case law bearing on the question sons not ordinarily residing in the State of Assam or upon goods not produced in Assam but in this connection it is enough to point out that what has been said above in respect of the tax being in the nature of a duty of excise applies which equal force to this part of the argument also It is clear therefore that there is no infirmity attaching to the Act on the ground that it is extra territorial in its operation It only remains to consider the last ground of attack namely that the Act is discriminatory in character and thus infringes Art The <ORG> was out to tax the transport of those commodities and must be presumed to have selected the most convenient way of doing it It is not for the courts to say that there were other ways of doing the thing or that all forms and varities should have been brought under the scope of the taxation As all the grounds of attack raised against the con stitutionality of the Act fail the appeals and the petitions in my opinion should be dismissed with costs I have deliberately refrained from making references to or relying upon decisions from other countries like the A or Australia because the cases decided in those countries cannot be any guide for the solution of the problems raised in this case inasmuch as the framework of the Constitution in those countries is not in pari materia with ours I regret to have to differ from the majority of the <ORG> but my only justification for taking a different view is that my reading of Part XIII of the Constitution does not justify the inference that taxation simpliciter is within the terms of Art This group consists of three appeals brought to this Court with a certificate issued by <ORG> under Art The three appellants are tea companies two of which Civil Appeal No of and Civil Appeal No of carry on their trade of growing tea in the District of Sibsagar in Assam while the third Civil Appeal No of carries on its trade in Jalpaiguri in West Bengal All the three companies which would be described hereafter as the appellants carry their tea to Calcutta in order that it may be sold in the Calcutta market for home consumption or export outside India Tea produced in Jalpaiguri has also to pass through a few miles of territory in the State of Assam while the tea produced in Assam has to go all the way through Assam to reach Calcutta It appears that a very small pro portion of tea produced and manufactured in Assam finds a market in Assam itself bulk of it finds its custom in the market at Calcutta Besides the tea which is carried by rail a substantial quantity has to go by road or by inland waterways and as such it becomes liable to pay the tax leviable under the Assam Taxation on goods carried by Roads or Inland Waterways Act Act XIII of hereafter called the Act The Act has been passed by <ORG> in order to provide for the levy of a tax on certain goods carried by road or inland waterways in the State of Assam and it has received the assent of the Governor on April By their respective petitions the appellants prayed that a writ of mandamus should issue directing the respondent and its officers to forbear from giving effect to the provisions of the Act and from otherwise enforcing it against the appellants The petitioners also claimed alternatively a writ of prohibition or any other appropriate writ restraining the respondent and its officers from enforcing the Act against the appellants The appellants challenged the vires of the Act on several grounds The principal ground however was that the Act had violated the provisions of Art It was also urged that tea was a controlled industry under the provisions of Act of and so it was the Union Government alone which was competent to regulate the manufacture production distribution or transport of the said commodity that being so <ORG> was not competent to pass the Act The validity of the Act was further challenged on the ground that though the Act purported to have been passed under Entry of List in substance and in reality it was a duty of excise and as such it could be enacted only under Entry of List According to the appellants the Act also suffered from the vice that it was violative of the fundamental right of equality before the law guaranteed by Art The correctness of these contentions was disputed by the respondent It urged that the Act was perfectly within the competence of <ORG> under Entry of List II and that the provisions of Part XIII were wholly inapplicable to it had not been violated and that there was no substance in the argument that as controlled industry it is only the Union Government which could deal with it or that in reality the Act bad imposed a duty of excise The petitions filed by the appellants were heard by a Special Bench of <ORG> All the pleas raised by the appellants were rejected by <NAME> and <NAME> who delivered separate but concurring judgments that is how the three appeals have come to this Court and they raise for our decision all the points which were argued before <ORG> The respondent has attempted to subject the petitioners to the provisions of the Act and the petitioners have challenged the authority of the respondent to levy a tax against them under the Act on the ground that the Act is ultra vires Since the principal question raised in these appeals appeared to be of considerable importance in which other States may also be interested we directed that notice should be issued to the Attorney General of India and the Advocates General in all the States of India The challenge to the vires of the Act on the ground that it contravenes Art The appellants contend that this provision imposes a limitation on the legislative power of the State Legislatures as well as the <ORG> and the vires of the Act will have to be judged on that basis The words used in Art On the other band the respondent the Attorney General and the other States have urged that taxing laws stand by themselves they are governed by the provisions of Part XII and no provision of Part XIII can be extended to them In the alternative it has been suggested that the provisions of Part XIII should be applied only to such legislative entries in the Seventh Schedule which deal with trade commerce and intercourse This alternative argument would bring within the purview of Part XIII Entry in List I which refers to interState trade and commerce Entry in List II which deals with trade and commerce within the State subject to the provisions of Entry in List III and Entry in List III which deals with trade and commerce as therein specified The arguments thus presented by both the parties appear prima facie to be logical and can claim the merit of attractive simplicity Does truth lie in one or the other contention raised by the parties or does it lie midway between those contentions This problem has to be resolved primarily by adopting a fair and reasonable construction of the relevant Articles in Part XIII but before we attempt that task it would be relevant to deal with some general considerations A large number of these States claimed sovereign rights within the limitations imposed by the paramount power in that behalf and they pur ported to exercise their legislative power of imposing taxes in respect of trade and commerce which inevitably led to the erection of customs barriers between themselves and the rest of India To the provisions of this section we will have occasion later to refer during the course of this judgment After India attained political freedom in and before the Constitution was adopted the historical process of the merger and integration of the several Indian States with the rest of the country was speedily accomplished with the result that when the Constitution was first passed the territories of India consisted of Part A States which broadly stated represented the Provinces in British India and Part States which were made up of Indian States It was realised that in course of time different political parties believing in different economic theories or ideologies may come in power in the several constituent units of the <ORG> and that may conceivably give rise to local and regional pulls and pressures in economic matters The provision contained in Art In appreciating the significance of these general consi derations we may profitably refer to the observations made by <NAME> <NAME> in <ORG> <NAME> while he was dealing with the commerce clause contained in Art There is another general consideration which has been pressed before us by the learned Attorney General and the States to which reference must be made we should bear in mind the fact that to the extent to which the frontiers of this freedom are widened to that extent is the legislative power of the States curtailed or limited The Legislatures of the States have plenary powers to Ed legislate in respect of topics covered by the legislative entries in Parts II and III If the words used in Art and determining the scope and effect of Part XIII we should bear in mind the effect of our decision on the legislative power of the <ORG> and also of <ORG> Having thus referred to some general considerations let us now proceed to examine the question as to whether tax laws are wholly outside the purview of Part XIII In support of the argument that Part XIII does not apply to tax laws the learned Attorney General has emphasised the fact that the power to levy a tax is an essential part of sovereignty itself and he has suggested that this power is not subject to judicial review and never has been held to be so In this connection he has invited our attention to the observa tions made in <NAME> Constitutional Limitations on the power of taxation The power to impose taxes says the author is one so unlimited in force and so searching in extent that the courts scarcely venture to declare that it is subject to any restriction whatever except such as rest in the discretion of the authority which exercises it stated that the power of taxing the people and their property is essential to the very existence of the government and may be legitimately exercised on the objects to which it is applicable to the utmost extent to which the government may choose to carry it The only security against the abuse of this power is found in the structure of the government itself Basing himself on this character of the taxing power of the <ORG> the learned Attorney General has asked us to hold that Part XIII can have no application to any statute imposing a tax Therefore the true position appears to be that though the power of levying tax is essential for the very existence of the government its exercise must inevitably be controlled by the constitutional provisions made in that behalf is not a right conferred by Part III of the Constitution it could not be enforced under Art It is clear that the effect of this decision is no more than this that the protection against the imposition and collection of taxes save by the authority of law directly comes under Art The next question which needs examination is whether tax laws are governed only by Part XII of the Constitution and not by Part XIII The argument is that Part XII is a self contained code it makes all necessary provisions and so the validity of any taxing statute can be judged only by reference to the provisions of the said Part In our opinion this argument fails to take notice of the fact that Art of the Constitution when in substance it says that a tax shall be levied by authority of law The authority of law to which it refers and under which alone a tax can be levied is to be found in Art Now if we look at Art which deals with the extent of laws made by <ORG> and by the <ORG>s of States it begins with the words subject to the provisions of this Constitution in other words the power of <ORG> and the <ORG>s of the States to make laws including laws imposing taxes is subject to the provisions of this Constitution and that must bring in the application of the provisions of Part XIII Therefore the argument based on the theory that tax laws are governed by the provisions of Part XII alone cannot be accepted The power to levy taxes is ultimately based on Art It is obvious that whatever may be the content of the said freedom it is not intended to be an absolute freedom absolute freedom in matters of trade commerce and intercourse would lead to economic confusion if not chaos and anarchy and so the freedom guaranteed by Art read in its proper context and subject to the limitations prescribed by the other relevant Articles in Part XIII must be regarded as imposing a constitutional limitation on the legislative power of <ORG> and the <ORG>s of the States No Provincial Legislature or Government shall a by virtue of the entry in the Provincial Legislative List relating to trade and commerce within the Province or the entry in that List relating to the production supply and distribution of commodities have power to pass any law or take any executive action prohibiting or restricting the entry into or export from the Province of goods of any class or description or by virtue of anything in this Act have power to impose any tax cess toll or due which as between goods manufactured or produced in the Province and similar goods not so manufactured or produced discriminates in favour of the former or which in the case of goods manufactured or produced outside the Province discriminates between goods manufactured or produced in one locality and similar goods manufactured or produced in another locality Any law passed in contravention of this section shall to the extent of the contravention be invalid There is no doubt that the prohibition prescribed by this section was confined to the Provincial Governments and <ORG> and did not apply to the <ORG> or <ORG> It is also true that the said prohibition had reference to the entries in the Provincial Legislative List relating to trade and commerce and to production supply and distribution of commodities The section also deals with prohibitions and restrictions in respect of import of goods into or their export from a Province Likewise discrimination against goods manufactured or produced outside the Province or goods produced in other localities is also prohibited it had in view and the only substantial change which it intended to make was to extend the application of the principles enunciated in the said section to <ORG> and <ORG> and to apply it to the territory which had subsequently become a part of India as indicated by the relevant Articles the essential content of freedom of trade and commerce as prescribed by the said section however continues to be the same In that case the vires of some of the provisions of the Sales Tax Laws Validation Act were challenged on several grounds In dealing with one of the points raised in support of the said challenge <NAME> who delivered the majority judgment considered the content of Entry in List It had been urged before the Court that the said entry should be liberally construed and should be held to include the power to tax and in support of this contention reliance was placed on certain American and Australian decisions This argument was repelled and it was held that Entry in List I is not to be interpreted as including taxation In coming to this conclusion the learned judge made certain general observations pointing out that it would not be always safe to rely upon American or Australian decisions in interpreting the provisions of our Constitution Said the learned judge the threads of our Constitution were no doubt taken from other Federal Constitutions but when they were woven into the fabric of our Constitution their reach and their complexion underwent changes a of the Constitution cannot be interpreted as throwing any light on the scope of Art with reference to the question of taxation as it merely reproduces of the Government of India Act and as there was no provision therein corresponding to Art could not have implied what is now sought to be inferred from Art The learned Attorney General has relied on these observations It would be noticed that incidental as these observations are what the learned judge was considering was the scope and effect of of the Government of India Act and he held that the content of the said section cannot be enlarged in the light of the provisions of Art Besides we feel considerable hesitation in accepting the view that the makers of the Constitution did not want to enrich and widen the content of freedom guaranteed by They knew that the Constitution would herald a new and inspiring era in the history of India and they were fully conscious of the importance of maintaining the economic unity of the Union of India in order that the federal form of government adopted by the Constitution should progress in a smooth and harmonious manner That is why we are inclined to hold that the broad and unambiguous words used in Art That takes us to the question as to whether Art operates only in respect of the entries relating to trade and commerce already specified There is no doubt that the sweep of the concept of trade commerce and intercourse is very wide but in the present case we are concerned with trade and so we will leave out of consideration commerce and intercourse Even as to trade it is really not necessary to discuss or determine what trade exactly means for it is common ground that the activity carried on by the appellants amounts to trade and it is not disputed that transport of goods or merchandise from one place to another is so essential to trade that it can be regarded as its integral part At this stage we would content ourselves with the statement that the freedom of trade guaranteed by Art is freedom from all restrictions except those which are provided by the other Articles in Part XIII What these restrictions denote may raise a larger issue but in the present case we will confine our decision to that aspect of the matter which arises from the provisions of the Act under scrutiny confers on the <ORG> power to impose restrictions on trade commerce and intercourse It provides that <ORG> may by law impose such restrictions on the freedom of trade commerce or intercourse between one State and another or within any part of the territory of India as may be required in the public interest It would be immediately noticed that the reference made to a restriction on the freedom of trade within any part of the territory of India as distinct from freedom of trade between one State and another clearly indicates that the freedom in question covers not only inter State trade but also intrastate trade Restrictions on the freedom of trade can be imposed by <ORG> if they are required in the public interest so that the generality of freedom guaranteed by Art That takes us to Art Notwithstanding anything in article neither <ORG> nor the <ORG> of a State shall have power to make any law giving or authorising the giving of any preference to one State over another or making or authorising the making of any discrimination between one State and another by virtue of any entry relating to trade and commerce in any of the Lists in the Seventh Schedule Nothing in clause shall prevent <ORG> from making any law giving or authorising the giving of any preference or making or authorising the making of any discrimination if it is declared by such law that it is necessary to do so for the purpose of dealing with a situation arising from scarcity of goods in any part of the territory of India This clause prohibits <ORG> from making any law which would give any preference to one State over another or would make any discrimination between one State and another by virtue of the relevant entries specified in it In other words in regard to the entries there specified the power to impose restrictions cannot be used for the purpose of giving any preference to one State over another or making any discrimination in that manner It empowers the <ORG> to make a law giving or authorising to give any preference or making any discrimination but this power can be exercised only if it is declared by law made by the <ORG> that it is necessary so to do for the purpose of dealing with a situation arising from scarcity of goods in any part of the territory of India in other words it is only when <ORG> is faced with the task of meeting an emergency created by the scarcity of goods in any particular part of India that it is authorised to make a law making a discrimination or giving preference in favour of the part thus affected On behalf of the States strong reliance is placed on the fact that Art expressly refers to the entries relating to trade and commerce in any of the Lists in the Seventh Schedule and it is urged tbat this gives a clear indication as to the scope of the provisions of Art itself There is some force in this contention but on the whole we are not prepared to hold that the reference to the said entries should govern the construction of Art it was thought expedient to prohibit expressly the said power of imposing restrictions from being used for the purpose of giving any preference in so far as the relevant entries are concerned Besides as we will presently point out there are other Articles in this Part which indicate that tax laws are included within Art Article reads thus Notwithstanding anything in article or article <ORG> may by law a impose on goods imported from other States or the <ORG> territories any tax to which similar goods manufactured or produced in that State are subject so however as not to discriminate between goods so imported and goods so manufactured or produced and impose such reasonable restrictions on the freedom of trade commerce or intercourse with or within that State as may be required in the public interest Provided that no Bill or amendment for the purposes of clause shall be introduced or moved in the <ORG> of a <ORG> without the previous sanction of the President a is to treat imported goods on the same basis as goods manufactured or produced in any <ORG> and it authorises tax to be levied on such imported goods in the same manner and to the same extent as may be levied on goods manufactured or produced inside the <ORG> We ought to add that this sub Article assumes that taxation can be levied by <ORG> on goods manufactured or produced within its territory and it provides that outside goods cannot be treated any worse How a tax can be levied on internal goods is however provided by Art Article empowers <ORG> to impose reasonable restrictions on the freedom of trade with other <ORG>s or within its own territory and in substance it gives power to <ORG> somewhat similar to the power conferred on the <ORG> by Art There are however obvious differences in the powers of the <ORG> and <ORG> <ORG>s no bill can be introduced without the previous sanction of the President and this requirement has obviously been inserted in order that regional economic pressures which may inspire legislation under the said clause should be duly examined in the light of the interest of national economy such legislation must also be in the public interest which feature is common with the provision contained in Art That is another additional restriction imposed on the powers of <ORG>s Thus there are three conditions which must be satisfied in passing an Act under Art the previous sanction of the President must be obtained the legislation must be in the public interest and it must impose restrictions which are reasonable a and together appears to be that a tax can be levied by a <ORG> <ORG> on goods manufactured or produced or imported in the <ORG> and thereby reasonable restrictions can be placed on the freedom of trade either with another <ORG> or between different areas of the same <ORG> Article saves existing laws and laws providing for <ORG> monopolies It reads thus Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing provisions of this Part or in any other provisions of this Constitution any State specified in Part of the First Schedule which before the commencement of this Constitution was levying any tax or duty on the import of goods into the State from other States or on the export of goods from the State to other States may if an agreement in that behalf has been entered into between <ORG> and the Government of that State continue to levy and collect such tax or duty subject to the terms of such agreement and for such period not exceeding ten years from the commencement of this Constitution as may be specified in the agreement Provided that the President may at any time after the expiration of five years from such commencement terminate or modify any such agreement if after consideration of the report of <ORG> constituted under article he thinks it necessary to do so Laws made by any <ORG> specified in Part of the First Schedule levying any tax or duty on the import of goods into the <ORG> from other <ORG>s or the export of goods from the <ORG> to other <ORG>s were expressly saved by a Art In other words taxing statutes or statutes imposing duties on goods would but for Art On a careful examination of the relevant provisions of Part XIII as a whole as well as the principle of economic unity which it is intended to safeguard by making the said provisions the conclusion appears to us to be inevitable that the content of freedom provided for by Art If the transport or the movement of goods is taxed solely on the basis that the goods are thus carried or transported that in our opinion directly affects the freedom of trade as contemplated by Art If the movement transport or the carrying of goods is allowed to be impeded obstructed or hampered by taxation without satisfying the requirements of Part XIII the freedom of trade on which so much emphasis is laid by Art provides that trade shall be free throughout the territory of India primarily it is the movement part of the trade that it has in mind and the movement or the transport part of trade must be free subject of course to the limitations and exceptions provided by the other Articles of Part XIII which means that tax laws can and do amount to restrictions freedom from which is guaranteed to trade under the said Part Does that mean that all tax laws attract the provisions of Part XIII whether their impact on trade or its movement is direct and immediate or indirect and remote It is precisely because the words used in Art However in interpreting the provisions of the Constitution we must always bear in mind that the relevant provision has to be read not in vacuo but as occurring in a single complex instrument in which one part may throw light on another we must therefore have regard to the general scheme of our Constitution as well as the particular provisions in regard to taxing laws should not be determined on a purely academic or doctrinnaire considerations in construing the said Article we must adopt a realistic approach and bear in mind the essential features of the separation of powers on which our Constitution rests Besides it is not irrelevant to remember in this connection that the Article we are construing imposes a constitutional limitation on the power of the <ORG> and State <ORG> to levy taxes and generally but for such limitation the power of taxation would be presumed to be for public good and would not be subject to judicial review or scrutiny Thus considered we think it would be reasonable and proper to hold that restrictions freedom from which is guaranteed by Art would be such restrictions as directly and immediately restrict or impede the free flow or movement of trade Taxes may and do amount to restrictions but it is only such taxes as directly and immediately restrict trade that would fall within the purview of Art The argument that all taxes should be governed by Art If the said argument is accepted it would mean for instance that even a legislative enactment prescribing the minimum wages to industrial employees may fall under Part XIII because in an economic sense an additional wage bill may indirectly affect trade or commerce a rational and workable test to apply would be Does the impugned restriction operate directly or immediately on trade or its A movement It is in the light of this test that we propose to examine the validity of the Act under scrutiny in the present proceedings We propose to confine our decision to the Act with which we are concerned If any other laws are similarly challenged the validity of the challenge will have to be examined in the light of the provisions of those laws provides that trade shall be free throughout the territory of India it means that the flow of trade shall run smooth and unhampered by any restriction either at the boundaries of the States or at any other points inside the States themselves It is the free movement or the transport of goods from one part of the country to the other that is intended to be saved and if any Act imposes any direct restrictions on the very movement of such goods it attracts the provisions of Art and its validity can be sustained only if it satisfies the requirements of Art At this stage we think it is necessary to repeat that when it is said that the freedom of the movement of trade cannot be subject to any restrictions in the form of taxes imposed on the carriage of goods or their movement all that is meant is that the said restrictions can be imposed by the State <ORG> only after satisfying the requirements of Art It is not as if no restrictions at all can be imposed on the free movement of trade Incidentally we may observe that the difference in the provisions contained in Art and passes a law imposing restrictions on the freedom of trade in the public interest whether or not the given law is in the public interest may not be justiciable and in that sense <ORG> is given the sole power to decide what restrictions can be imposed in public interest as authorised by Art As we have already pointed out the Act has been passed providing for the levy of tax on certain goods carried by roads or inland waterways in the State of Assam Section defines a producer as meaning a producer of tea and including the person in charge of the garden where it is produced It also makes similar provisions for jute with which we are not concerned in the present proceedings Section provides for taxing authorities and their powers Section provides inter alia that every producer shall furnish returns of the manufactured tea carried in tea chests in such form and to such authority as may be prescribed Section makes a provision for licensing of balers who are persons owning or possessing pressing machines for the compression of jute into bales Section prescribes the procedure for levying the assessment and provides for the cancellation of assessment in the cases specified Section deals with the assessment in cases of evasion and escape with rectification and with penalty for non submission of returns and evasion of taxes Section provides for notice of demand and is This Act has been passed by <ORG> under Entry in List and naturally it purports to be a tax on goods carried by roads or by inland waterways That being so the restriction placed by the Act on the free movement of the goods is writ large on its face As we have made it clear during the course of this judgment we do not propose to express any Opinion as to the possible consequence of the view which we are taking in the present proceedings We are dealing in the present case with an Act passed by <ORG> which imposes a restriction in the form of taxation on the carriage or movement of goods and we hold that such a restriction can be imposed by <ORG> only if the relevant Act is passed in the manner prescribed by Art This question can be considered from another point of view What is in dispute is whether or not such legislative competence is subject to the limitations prescribed by Part XIII Now what does an act passed under the said Entry purport to do It purports to put a restraint in the form of taxation on the movement of trade and if the movement of trade is regarded as an integral part of trade itself the Act in substance puts a restriction on trade itself It is no doubt true that the points which arose for decision in those cases had reference to the fundamental rights guaranteed by Arts or but we are referring to those decisions in order to emphasise that the test there adopted would in the present case lead to the conclusion that the Act with which we are concerned is invalid Now if the directness of legislation has to be considered it is clear that the Act imposes a tax on the carriage of goods and that immediately takes it within the purview of Part XIII The challenge to the Act proceeded on two grounds that it violated the fundamental right guaranteed under Art and that it offended against the provisions of Art The challenge on the first ground was repelled because it was held that gambling cannot be treated as trade or business under Art Even so the learned Chief Justice incidentally applied the test of pith and substance and observed that the impugned act was in pith and substance an act in respect of betting and gambling and since betting or gambling was not trade commerce or business the validity of the Act had not to be decided by the yardstick of reasonableness and public interest laid down in Arts In fact referring to phrases such as pith and substance Lord <NAME> has observed that they no doubt raise in convenient form an appropriate question in cases where the real issue is one of subject matter as when the point is whether a particular piece of legislation is a law in respect of some subject within the permitted field They may also serve useful purpose in the process of deciding whether an enactment which works some interference with trade commerce and intercourse among the States is nevertheless untouched by as being essentially regulatory in character pp These observations would indicate that the test of pith and substance is generally and more appropriately applied when a dispute arises as to the legislative competence of the legislature and it has to be resolved by reference to the entries to which the impugned legislation is relatable When there is a conflict between two entries in the legislative lists and legislation by reference to one entry would be competent but not by reference to the other the doctrine of pith and substance is invoked for the purpose of determining the true nature and character of the legislation in question Vide <NAME> <ORG> Khulna and <NAME> <NAME> We may in that connection refer to two of such decisions at this stage is expressly subordinated to the State power of taxing goods imported from sister States provided only no discrimination is made in favour of similar goods of local origin According to the learned Chief Justice the commercial unity of India is made to give way before the State power of imposing any non discriminatory tax on goods imported from sister States were declared to be unconstitutional on two other grounds which had no direct connection with the challenge under Part XIII of the Constitution provides safeguards for carrying on trade as a whole as distinct from the rights of an individual to carry it on In other words the said Article was concerned with the passage of commodities or persons either within or without the <ORG> frontiers but not directly with individuals carrying on the trade or commerce so that the two Articles had been framed in order to secure two different objects To the same effect are some of the observations made by <NAME> in the case of <NAME> It may be possible to urge that trade as a whole moves inevitably with the aid of human agency and so protection granted to trade may involve protection even to the individuals carrying on the said trade Before we conclude we would like to refer to two decisions in which the scope and effect of the provisions of of the Australian Constitution came to be considered We have deliberately not referred to these decisions earlier because we thought it would be unreasonable to refer to or rely on the said section or the decisions thereon for the purpose of construing the relevant Articles of Part XIII of our Constitution would not be safe to seek for guidance or assistance from the Australian decisions when we are called upon to construe the provisions of our Constitution In this connection we have already referred to the note of warning struck by <NAME> against indiscriminate reliance being placed on Australian and American decisions in interpreting our Constitution in the case of <NAME> Co The same caution was expressed by <NAME> as early as when he observed in The Central Provinces and Berar Sales of Motor Spirit and Lubricants Taxation Act there are few subjects on which the decisions of other Courts require to be treated with greater caution than that of federal and provincial powers for in the last analysis the decision must depend upon the words of the Constitution which the Court is interpreting and since no two Constitutions are in identical terms it is extremely unsafe to assume that a decision on one of them can be applied without qualification to another This may be so even where the words or expressions used are the same in both cases for a word or a phrase may take a colour from its context and bear different senses accordingly Even so the reported decisions of this Court show that in dealing with constitutional problems reference has not infrequently been made to Australian and American decisions and that we think brings out the characteristic feature of the working of the judicial process When you are dealing with the problem of construing a constitutional provision which is none too clear or lucid you feel inclined to inquire how other judicial minds have responded to the challenge presented by similar provisions in other sister Constitutions It is in that spirit that we propose to refer to two <ORG> decisions which dealt with the construction of of the Australian Constitution The first paragraph of of the Australian Constitution around which has grown in the words of Lord <NAME> a labyrinth where there is no golden thread reads thus On the imposition of uniform The part played by <NAME> who carried on the trade of growing and processing dried fruits in securing judicial pronouncements on the true scope and effect of the said section is wellknown He fought three valiant legal battles in which he successfully asserted his right as a trader against legislative encroachment It is to the observations made by <ORG> in the last case to which we wish to refer Referring to the word free used in the said section Lord <NAME> observed that the said word in itself is vague and indeterminate it must take its colour from the context Then he referred to the fact that free trade ordinarily means freedom from tariffs but he immediately added that free in cannot be limited to freedom in the last mentioned sense According to this judgment every step in the series of operations which constitute the particular transaction is an act of trade and control under the State law of any of these steps must be an interference with its freedom as trade In deciding the said question one of the tests which was applied by Lord <NAME> was Does the act not remotely or incidentally as to which they will say something later but directly restrict the inter State business of banking and he concluded that two general propositions may be accepted that regulation of trade commerce and intercourse among the States is compatible with its absolute freedom and that is violated Only when a legislative or executive act operates to restrict such trade commerce and intercourse directly and immediately as distinct from creating Some indirect or consequential impediment which may fairly be regarded as remote In the result we hold that the Act has put a direct restriction on the freedom of trade and since in doing so it has not complied with the provisions of Art In view of this conclusion it is unnecessary to consider the other points urged in support of the challenge against the validity of the Act The three appeals and the two petitions are accordingly allowed and writs or orders directed to be issued as prayed The appellants and the petitioners will be entitled to their costs from the respondent Section provides that every producer and dealer shall furnish a return of manufactured tea carried in chests In exercise of the powers conferred by sub the Commissioner of Taxes issued a notification in <ORG> notifying for general information that returns under the Act and the Rules thereunder for the period between June and September shall be furnished on or before October and for the subsequent quarters on or before the dates specified therein of the Constitution filed in <ORG> tile authority of <ORG> to enact the Act on the plea that the Act violated the guarantee of freedom of trade commerce and intercourse under Art <ORG> rejected the plea raised by the petitioners and against the orders passed three appeals with certificates of fitness under Art The principal question canvassed in these proceedings is about the competence of <ORG> to enact the Act of the Constitution trade commerce and intercourse being declared free throughout the territory of India the statute authorising imposition of restrictions or burdens on that freedom by levying tax under the authority of an Act which does not conform to the conditions prescribed by the Constitution is invalid In terms the tax imposed by the Act is a tax on goods carried by road and inland waterways and is not of the nature of a duty of excise But the exercise of legislative power of the <ORG> and <ORG>s conferred by the legislative lists is restricted by diverse provisions of the Constitution Besides placing an irremovable ban on the executive authority it restricts the legislative power of the <ORG> and the <ORG> legislatures conferred by Arts On the exercise of the legislative power to tax trade commerce and intercourse restrictions are prescribed by certain provisions Contained in Part XII Arts The legislative power to tax is restricted also by the fundamental freedoms contained in Part III Arts Article cl of the Constitution expressly provides that the legislative powers of the <ORG> and the <ORG> Legisla tures to make laws are subject to the provisions of the Constitution and Art The power of taxation is essentially an attribute of the sovereignty of the <ORG> and is not exercised in consideration of the protection it affords or the benefit that it confers upon citizens and aliens of the Constitution the power to tax can be exercised by authority of law alone and the Constitution affirmatively grants the power of taxation under diverse heads under the three lists of the seventh schedule The guarantee of freedom of trade and commerce is not addressed merely against prohibitions complete or partial it is addressed to tariffs licensing marketing regulations price control nationalisation economic or social planning discriminatory tariffs compulsory appropriation of goods freezing or stand still orders and similar other impediments operating directly and immediately on the freedom of commercial intercourse as well Every sequence in the series of operations which constitutes trade or commerce is an act of trade or commerce and burdens or impediments imposed on any such step are restrictions on the freedom of trade commerce and inter course Not merely discriminative tariffs restricting movement of goods are included in the restrictions which are hit by Art but ball taxation on commercial intercourse even imposed as a measure for collection of revenue is so hit Between discriminatory tariffs and trade barriers on the one hand and taxation for raising revenue on commercial intercourse the difference is one of purpose and not of quality Articles and which I will presently advert to make it abundantly clear that the freedom contemplated was freedom of trade commerce and intercourse in all their varied aspects inclusive of all activities which constitute commercial intercourse and not merely from restrictions on trade commerce and intercourse as such The basic principle underlying Art power to regulate commerce is granted but the freedom of commerce as guaranteed by our Constitution is not found enunciated in the Constitution of the United <ORG>s But our Constitution has made a sig nificant departure from the Australian Constitution Whereas by of the Australian Constitution freedom of trade commerce and intercourse is guaranteed among the <ORG>s i at inter <ORG> level our Constitution has made trade commerce and intercourse free throughout the territory of India Nor can freedom be limited to freedom from legislative control it must equally include executive control Every step in the series of operations which constitute the particular transaction is an act of trade and control under the <ORG> law of any of these steps must be an interference with its freedom as trade These observations made in the context of a guarantee against obstruction to the flow of interstate trade and commerce involved the conception of freedom from customs duties imports border prohibitions and restrictions of every kind the people were to be free to trade with each other and to pass to and fro among the <ORG>s without any burden hindrance or restriction based merely on the fact that they were not members of the same <ORG> Freedom guaranteed by Art is however not absolute it is subject to the provisions contained in Part XIII of the Constitution Such restrictions on trade commerce and intercourse may be intrastate as well as inter <ORG> the only condition which the restrictions must fulfil is that they must be imposed in the public interest The learned Attorney General urged that the courts are incompetent to adjudge whether the quantum and the incidence of a tax imposed by a <ORG> in exercise of its powers are in the public interest and therefore it must be inferred that Arts That the courts may not in adjudging upon the validity of a restriction imposed by a parliamentary statute lightly enter upon an investigation whether the amount sought to be recovered and its incidence are in the public interest is not a ground for holding that Art The courts will normally rely upon the wisdom of the <ORG> and presume that taxes are generally imposed in the public interest but that does not exclude the jurisdiction of the court in a given case to enter upon an enquiry whether an impugned legislation satisfies the constitutional test the <ORG> <ORG>s are invested with similar authority to impose restrictions on the freedom of trade commerce and intercourse with or within the <ORG> as may be required in the public interest and may not from the very nature of the jurisdiction exercised by the <ORG>s be co extensive but subject thereto the <ORG> and the <ORG> <ORG>s are entrusted in exercise of legislative authority with powers to restrict freedom of trade commerce and intercourse Why the Constitution should have enacted that the <ORG>ary law may impose restrictions as may be required in the public interest and the <ORG> law may impose reasonable restrictions as may be required in the public interest it is difficult to appreciate It is unnecessary for the purpose of these cases to enter upon a discussion whether there is any real distinction between the quality of restrictions which may be imposed by legislation by the <ORG> and <ORG> <ORG>s exercising authority respectively under Arts The authority of the <ORG> <ORG> to enact legislation imposing restrictions on trade commerce and intercourse is therefore subject to the condition that before the Bill or amendment of a statute is moved the previous sanction of the President must be obtained Legislative power of the <ORG> imposing restrictions on the freedom of trade commerce and intercourse may therefore be validly exercised if the restrictions are required in the public interest On the exercise of authority in that behalf by the <ORG> <ORG>s there are placed two restrictions that the restriction must be reasonable and required in the public interest that the Bill or amendment imposing restriction can be moved or introduced in the <ORG> only with the previous sanction of the President and to the <ORG> and the <ORG> <ORG>s to make laws imposing restrictions on the freedom of trade commerce and intercourse prohibition is imposed on the exercise of the power in making laws giving or authorising the giving of any preference to one <ORG> over another or making or authorising the making of any discrimination between one <ORG> and another by virtue of any entry relating to trade and commerce in any of the Lists in the seventh schedule the discrimination which is prohibited is under a law made by virtue of an entry relating to trade and commerce in the seventh schedule The expression relating to trade and commerce used in Art in my judgment includes all those entries in the lists of the seventh schedule which deal with the power to legislate directly or indirectly in respect of activities in the nature of trade and commerce That clause authorises the <ORG> but not the <ORG> <ORG>s to make laws notwithstanding el when it is declared by law that it is necessary to make discrimination which is prohibited for the purpose of dealing with the situation arising from scarcity of goods in any part of the territory of India Article in so far as it is material provides that notwithstanding anything in Art <ORG> may by law a impose on goods imported from other <ORG>s or the <ORG> territories any tax to which similar goods manufactured or produced in that <ORG> are subject so however as not to discriminate between goods so imported and goods so manufactured or produced pose tax on the import of goods to which similar goods manufactured or produced in the <ORG> are subject provided that by taxing the goods imported from another <ORG> or <ORG> territory no discrimination is practised Undoubtedly the provisions of Part XIII of the Constitution do not impose additional or independent powers of taxation the powers of taxation are to be found conferred by Arts trade commerce and intercourse are declared free There is however no such condition imposed in the matter of enactment of laws imposing non discriminative tariffs under el Clause deals with a general restriction which includes a restriction by the imposition of a burden in the nature of tax Article protects existing laws except in so far as the President may by order or otherwise direct and it also validates certain enactments made before the commencement of the Constitution Fourth Amendment Act and authorises the <ORG> and <ORG> in future to make laws relating to matters referred to in sub cl Article of the Constitution which was repealed by the Constitution Seventh Amendment Act provided in so far as it is material that notwithstanding anything in the foregoing provisions of Part XIII or any other provisions of the Constitution a State specified in Part of the First Schedule which before the commencement of the Constitution was levying any tax or duty on the import of goods into the State from other States or on the export of goods from the State to other States may if an agreement in that behalf has been entered into between <ORG> and the Government of that State continue to levy and collect such tax or duty subject to the terms of such agreement The marginal note of the Article refers to the power of the States specified in Part of the First Schedule to levy tax as a power to impose restrictions on trade and commerce and clearly supports the view that within the meaning of Art Even though <ORG> had by item of the seventh schedule legislative authority to impose this tax the State could not exercise this authority in the absence of the previous sanction of the President and the invalidity of the Act imposing the tax on goods and passengers is not cured the President not having assented to the Act at any time after it was passed by <ORG> The argument that this view seriously restricts the sovereignty of the <ORG> has in my view little force In any event in adjudging the vires of a statute the impact of the view which the interpretation placed by the court may produce on some cherished notion of sovereignty of the component <ORG> must be ignored In that view the Assam Taxation on Goods carried by Roads or Inland Waters Act must be regarded as infringing the guarantee of freedom of trade and commerce under Art In the view expressed by me I do not deem it necessary to enter upon certain subsidiary contentions such as the application of the pith and substance doctrine to the interpretation of the relevant clauses the alleged violation by the Act of the equal protection clause of the Constitution and the effect of Act XXIX of enacted by the <ORG> which were debated at the <ORG> In the view taken the appeals must be allowed and the Rule in the two applications made absolute with costs ORDER OF COURT In view of the majority judgment the appeals and the writ petitions are allowed with costs one set of hearing fees
