HEADNOTE Allowing the writ petition the <ORG> HELD While considering the question of validity of conditions of detention courts must necessarily bear in mind the vital distinction between preventive detention and punitive detention Punitive detention is intended to inflict punishment on a person who is found by the judicial process to have committed an offence while preventive detention is not by way of punishment at all but it is intended to pre empt a person from indulging in conduct injurious to the society Article in clauses to deals specifically with safeguards against preventive detention and enjoins that any law of preventive detention or action by way of preventive detention taken under such law must be in conformity with the restrictions laid down by those clauses on pain of invalidation Article also lays down restrictions on the power of preventive detention Article as interpreted in <NAME> case requires that no one shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except by procedure established by law and this procedure must be reasonable fair and just and not arbitrary whimsical or fanciful and it is for the <ORG> to decide in the exercise of its constitutional power or judicial review whether the deprivation of life or personal liberty in a given case is by procedure which is reasonable fair and just or it is otherwise The law of preventive detention must therefore pass the test not only of Article but also of Article It is a power to be exercised with the greatest care and caution and the courts have to be ever vigilant to see that this power is not abused or misused inasmuch as the preventive detention is qualitatively different from punitive detention and their purposes are different In case of punitive detention the person has fullest opportunity to defend himself while in case of preventive detention the opportunity that he has for contesting the action of the Executive is very limited The prisoner or detenu has all the fundamental rights and other legal rights available to a free person save those which are incapable of enjoyment by reason of incarceration A constitutional provision must be construed not in a narrow and constricted sense but in a wide and liberal manner so as to anticipate and take account of changing conditions and purposes so that the constitutional provision does not get atrophied or fossilized but remains flexible enough to meet the newly emerging problems and challenges This principle applies with greater force in relation to a fundamental right enacted by the Constitution The right to life enshrined in Article cannot be restricted to mere animal existence It means something much more than just physical survival Moreover it is every kind of deprivation that is hit by Article whether such deprivation be permanent or temporary and furthermore deprivation is not an act which is complete once and for all it is a continuing act and so long as it lasts it must be in accordance with procedure established by law The right to life includes the right to live with human dignity and all that goes along with it namely the bare necessaries of life such as adequate nutrition clothing and shelter and facilities for reading writing and expressing oneself in diverse forms freely moving about and mixing and commingling with fellow human beings The magnitude and content of the components of this right would depend upon the extent of the economic development of the country but it must in any view of the matter include the right to the basic necessities of life and also the right to carry on such functions and activities as constitute the bare minimum expression of the human self Every act which offends against or impairs human dignity would constitute deprivation pro tanto of this right to live and it would have to be in accordance with reasonable fair and just procedure established by law which stands the test of other fundamental rights Therefore any form of torture or cruel inhuman or degrading treatment would be offensive to human dignity and constitute an inroad into this right to live and it would on this view be prohibited by Article unless it is in accordance with procedure prescribed by law but no law which authorises and no procedure which leads to such torture or cruelty inhuman or degrading treatment can ever stand the test of reasonableness and non arbitrariness it would plainly be unconstitutional and void as being violative of Article and There is implicit in Article the right to protection against torture or cruel inhuman or degrading treatment which is enunciated in Article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and guaranteed by Article of the international Covenant on Civil and Political Rights This right to live which is comprehended within the broad connotation of the right to life can concededly be abridged according to procedure established by law and therefore when a person is lawfully imprisoned this right to live is bound to suffer attenuation to the extent to which it is incapable of enjoyment by reason of incarceration But as part of the right to live with human dignity and therefore as a necessary component of the right to life he would be entitled to have interviews with the members of his family and friends and no prison regulation or procedure laid down by prison regulation regulating the right to have interviews with the members of the family and friends can be upheld as constitutionally valid under Article and unless it is reasonable fair and just Considered from the point of view also of the right to personal liberty enshrined in Article the right to have interviews with members of the family and friends is clearly part of personal liberty guaranteed under that Article The expression personal liberty occurring in Article is of the widest amplitude and it covers a variety of rights which go to constitute the personal liberty of a man and it also includes rights which have been raised to the status of distinct Fundamental Rights and given additional protection under Article Therefore personal liberty would include the right to socialise with members of the family and friends subject of course to any valid prison regulations and under Articles and such prison regulations must be reasonable and non arbitrary When an under trial prisoner is granted the facility The right of a detenu to consult a legal adviser of his choice for any purpose not necessarily limited to defence in a criminal proceeding but also for securing release from preventive detention or filling a writ petition or prosecuting any claim or proceeding civil or criminal is obviously included in the right to live with human dignity and is also part of personal liberty and the detenu cannot be deprived of this right nor can this right of the detenu be interfered with except in accordance with reasonable fair and just procedure established by a valid law The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This petition under Article of the Constitution raises a question in regard of the right of a detenu under the Conservation of Foreign Exchange Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act hereinafter referred to as COFEPOSA Act to have interview with a lawyer and the members of his family The facts giving rise to the petition are few and undisputed and may be briefly stated as follows The petitioner who is a British national was arrested and detained in the Central Jail Tihar under an Order dated rd November issued under section of the COFEPOSA Act It seems that some criminal proceeding was pending against the petitioner for attempting to smuggle hashish out of the country and for the purpose of her defence in such criminal proceeding it was necessary for her to consult her lawyer but even her lawyer found it difficult to obtain an interview with her because in order to arrange an interview he was required to obtain prior appointment from the District Magistrate Delhi and the interview could take place only in the presence of a <ORG> Officer nominated by the Collector of <ORG> This procedure for obtaining interview caused considerable hardship and inconvenience and there were occasions when even after obtaining prior appointment from the District Magistrate Delhi her lawyer could not have an interview with her since no <ORG> Officer nominated by the Collector of <ORG> remained present at the appointed time This restriction on interviews was imposed by the Prison Authorities by virtue of clause sub clauses i and ii of the Conditions of Detention laid down by <ORG> under an Order dated rd August issued in exercise of the powers conferred under section of the COFEPOSA Act These two sub clauses of clause provided inter alia as under The conditions of detention in respect of classification and interviews shall be as under a Interviews Subject to the direction issued by the Administrator from time to time permission for the grant of interviews with a detenu shall be granted by the District Magistrate Delhi as under i Interview with legal adviser Interview with legal adviser in connection with defence of a detenu in a criminal case or in regard to writ petitions and the like may be allowed by prior appointment in the presence of an officer of <ORG> to be nominated by the local Collector of <ORG> or Deputy Director of Enforcement who sponsors the case for detention ii Interview with family members A monthly interview may be permitted for members of the family consisting of wife children or parents of the detenu The petitioner therefore preferred a petition in this Court under Article challenging the constitutional validity of sub clauses i and ii of clause of the Conditions of Detention Order and praying that the Administrator of the Union Territory of Delhi and the Superintendent of Tihar Central Jail be directed to permit her to have interview with her lawyer and the members of her family without complying with the restrictions laid down in those sub clauses It was contended on behalf of the petitioner that allowing interview with the members of the family only once in a month was discriminatory and unreasonable particularly when under trial prisoners were granted the facility of interview with relatives and friends twice in a week under Rule A and convicted prisoners were permitted to have interview with their relatives and friends once in a week under Rule of the Rules set out in the Manual for the Superintendence and Management of Jails in the Punjab The respondents resisted the contentions of the petitioner and submitted that sub clauses i and ii of clause were not violative of Articles and since the restrictions imposed by them were reasonable fair and just but stated that they would have no objection if instead of a monthly interview the petitioner was granted the facility of interview with her daughter and sister twice in a week as in the case of under trial prisoners and so far as interview with the lawyer is concerned they would not insist on the presence of a customs or excise officer at the interview Though these two concessions were made on behalf of the respondents at the hearing of the petition before us the question still remains whether sub clause i and ii of cl are valid and it is necessary that we should examine this question in the context of our constitutional values since there are a large number of detenus under the COFEPOSA Act and the conditions of their detention in regard to interviews must be finally settled by this Court Now it is necessary to bear in mind the distinction between preventive detention and punitive detention when we are considering the question of validity of conditions of detention There is a vital distinction between these two kinds of detention Punitive detention is intended to inflict punishment on a person who is found by the judicial process to have committed an offence while preventive detention is not by way of punishment at all but it is intended to pre empt a person from indulging in conduct injurious to the society It is a drastic power to detain a person without trial and there are many countries where it is not allowed to be exercised except in times of war or aggression Our Constitution does recognise the existence of this power but it is hedged in by various safeguards set out in Articles and in clauses to deals specifically with safeguards against preventive detention and any law of preventive detention or action by way of preventive detention taken under such law must be in conformity with the restrictions laid down by those clauses on pain of invalidation there is also Art Until the decision of this <ORG> in <NAME> <ORG> a very narrow and constricted meaning was given to the guarantee embodied in Art and that article was understood to embody only that aspect of the rule of law which requires that no one shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty without the authority of law So long as there was some law which prescribed a procedure authorising deprivation of life or personal liberty it was supposed to meet the requirement of Art It is not enough to secure compliance with the prescription of Article that there should be a law prescribing some semblance of a procedure for depriving a person of his life or personal liberty but the procedure prescribed by the law must be reasonable fair and just and if it is not so the law would be void as violating the guarantee of Art as interpreted in <NAME> case supra requires that no one shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except by procedure established by law and this procedure must be reasonable fair and just and not arbitrary whimsical or fanciful and it is for the <ORG> to decide in the exercise of its constitutional power of judicial review whether the deprivation of life or personal liberty in a given case is by procedure which is reasonable fair and just or it is otherwise The law of preventive detention has therefore now to pass the test not only of Art and if the constitutional validity of any such law is challenged the <ORG> would have to decide whether the procedure laid down by such law for depriving a person of his personal liberty is reasonable fair and just It is a power to be exercised with the greatest care and caution and the courts have to be ever vigilant to see that this power is not abused or misused In case of punitive detention the person concerned is detained by way of punishment after he is found guilty of wrong doing as a result of trial where he has the fullest opportunity to defend himself while in case of preventive detention he is detained merely on suspicion with a view to preventing him from doing harm in future and the opportunity that he has for contesting the action of the Executive is very limited The question which then arises is whether a person preventively detained in a prison has any rights which he can enforce in <ORG> Once his freedom is curtailed by incarceration in a jail does he have any fundamental rights at all or does he leave them behind when he enters the prison gate The answer to this question is no longer res integra It has been held by this Court in the two <NAME> cases that fundamental rights do not flee the person as he enters the prison although they may suffer shrinkage necessitated by incarceration The prisoner or detenu has all the fundamental rights and other legal rights available to a free person save those which are incapable of enjoyment by reason of incarceration A compulsion under the authority of law following upon a conviction to live in a prison house entails to by its own force the deprivation of fundamental freedoms like the right to move freely throughout the territory of India or the right to practise a profession A man of profession would thus stand stripped of his right to hold consultations while serving out his sentence But the Constitution guarantees other freedoms like the right to acquire hold and dispose of property for the exercise of which incarceration can be no impediment Likewise even a convict is entitled to the precious right guaranteed by Art of the Constitution that he shall not be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law <NAME> in the latter case proceeded to add in his characteristic style The jurisdictional reach and range of this <ORG> writ to hold prison caprice and cruelty in constitutional leash is incontestable and concluded by observing Thus it is now clear law that a prisoner wears the armour of basic freedom even behind bars and that on breach thereof by lawless officials the law will respond to his distress signals through writ aid The Indian human has a constant companion the <ORG> armed with the Constitution <NAME> It is interesting to note that <ORG> of the United States has also taken the same view in regard to rights of prisoners Mr Justice <NAME> struck a humanistic note when he said in <NAME> case Prisoners are still persons entitled to all constitutional rights unless their liberty has been constitutionally curtailed by procedures that satisfy all the requirements of due process But though his rights may be diminished by environment a prisoner is not wholly stripped off constitutional protections when he is imprisoned for crime Mr Justice <NAME> reiterated his thesis when he asserted Every prisoner liberty i of courses circumscribed by the very fact of his confinement but his interest in the limited liberty left to him is then only the more substantial Conviction of a crime does not render one a non person whose rights are subject to the whim of the prison administration and therefore the imposition of any serious punishment within the system requires procedural safeguards Mr Justice <NAME> also expressed himself clearly and explicitly in the same terms I have previously stated my view that a prisoner does not shed his basic constitutional rights at the prison gate and I fully support the court holding that the interest of inmates in freedom from imposition of serious discipline is a liberty entitled to due process protection What is stated by these learned Judges in regard to the rights of a prisoner under the Constitution of the United States applies equally in regard to the rights of a prisoner or detenu under our constitutional system It must therefore now be taken to be well settled that a prisoner or detenu is not stripped of his fundamental or other legal rights save those which are inconsistent with his incarceration and if any of these rights are violated the <ORG> which is to use the words of <NAME> not a distant abstraction omnipotent in the books but an activist institution which is the cynosure of public hope will immediately spring into action and run to his rescue We will first take up for consideration the Fundamental Right of the detenu under Article because that is a Fundamental Right which has after the decision in <NAME> case supra a highly activist magnitude and it embodies a constitutional value of supreme importance in a democratic society It provides that no one shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law and such procedure shall be reasonable fair and just Legislation both statutory and constitutional is enacted it is true from an experience of evils but its general language should not therefore be necessarily confined to the form that evil had therefore taken Time works changes brings into existence new conditions and purposes Therefore a principle to be vital must be capable of wider application than mischief which gave it birth They are not ephemeral enactments designed to meet passing occasions They are to use the words of Chief Justice <NAME> designed to approach immorality as nearly as human institutions can approach it The future is their care and provisions for events of good and bad tendencies of which no prophecy can be made Its general principles would have little value and be converted by precedent into important and lifeless formulas Rights declared in the words might be lost in reality The meaning and vitality of the Constitution have developed against narrow and restrictive construction This principle of interpretation which requires that a Constitutional provision must be construed not in a narrow and constricted sense but in a wide and liberal manner so as to anticipate and take account of changing conditions and purposes so that the Constitutional provision does not get atrophied or fossilized but remains flexible enough to meet the newly emerging problems and challenges applies with greater force in relation to a fundamental right enacted by the Constitution Now obviously the right to life enshrined in Article can not be restricted to mere animal existence It means something much more than just physical survival The inhibition against its deprivation extends to all those limbs and faculties by which life is enjoyed The provision equally prohibits the mutilation of the body or amputation of an arm or leg or the putting out of an eye or the destruction of any other organ of the body through which the soul communicates with the outer world Moreover it is every kind of deprivation that is hit by Article whether such deprivation be permanent or temporary and furthermore depriva tion is not an act which is complete once and for all it is a continuing act and so long as it lasts it must be in accordance with procedure established by law But the question which arises is whether the right to life is limited only to protection of limb or faculty or does it go further and embrace something more We think that the right to life includes the right to live with human dignity and all that goes along with it namely the bare necessaries of life such as adequate nutrition clothing and shelter and facilities for reading writing and expressing one self in diverse forms freely moving about and mixing and commingling with fellow human beings Of course the magnitude and content of the components of this right would depend upon the extent of the economic development of the country but it must in any view of the matter include the right to the basic necessities of life and also the right to carry on such functions and activities as constitute the bare minimum expression of the human self Every act which offends against or impairs human dignity would constitute deprivation protanto of this right to live and it would have to be in accordance with reasonable fair and just procedure established by law which stands the test of other fundamental rights Now obviously any form of torture or cruel inhuman or degrading treatment would be offensive to human dignity and constitute an inroad into this right to live and it would on this view be prohibited by Article unless it is in accordance with procedure prescribed by law but no law which authorises and no procedure which leads to such torture or cruel inhuman or degrading treatment can ever stand the test of reasonableness and non arbitrariness it would plainly be unconstitutional and void as being violative of Articles and It would thus be seen that there is implicit in Article the right to protection against torture or cruel inhuman or degrading treatment which is enunciated in Article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and guaranteed by Article of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights This right to live which is comprehended within the broad connotation of the right to life can concededly be abridged according to procedure established by law and therefore when a person is lawfully imprisoned this right to live is bound to suffer attenuation to the extent to which it is incapable of enjoyment by reason of incarceration But as part of the right to live with human dignity and therefore as a necessary component of the right to life he would be entitled to have interviews with the members of his family and friends and no prison regulation or procedure laid down by prison regulation regulating the right to have interviews with the members of the family and friends can be upheld as constitutionally valid under Articles and unless it is reasonable fair and just The same consequence would follow even if this problem is considered from the point of view of the right to personal liberty enshrined in Article for the right to have interviews with members of the family and friends is clearly part of personal liberty guaranteed under that Article The expression personal liberty occurring in Article has been given a broad and liberal interpretation in <NAME> case supra and it has been held in that case that the expression personal liberty used in that Article is of the widest amplitude and it covers a variety of rights which go to constitute the personal liberty of a man and it also includes rights which have been raised to the status of distinct Fundamental Rights and given additional protection under Article There can therefore be no doubt that personal liberty would include the right to socialise with members of the family and friends subject of course to any valid prison regulations and under Articles and such prison regulations must be reasonable and non arbitrary The right of a detenu to consult a legal adviser of his choice for any purpose not necessarily limited to defence in a criminal proceeding but also for securing release from preventive detention of filing a writ petition or prosecuting any claim or proceeding civil or criminal is obviously included in the right to live with human dignity and is also part of personal liberty and the detenu cannot be deprived of this right nor can this right of the detenu be interfered with except in accordance with reasonable fair and just procedure established by a valid law A prison regulation may therefore regulate the right of a detenu to have interview with a legal adviser in a manner which is reasonable fair and just but it cannot prescribe an arbitrary or unreasonable procedure for regulating such an interview and if it does so it would be violative of Articles and This would obviously cause great hardship and inconvenience because the legal adviser would have to apply to the District Magistrate Delhi well in advance and then also the time fixed by the District Magistrate Delhi may not be suitable to the legal adviser who would ordinarily be a busy practitioner and in that event from a practical point of view the right to consult a legal adviser would be rendered illusory Moreover the interview must take place in the presence of an officer of <ORG> to be nominated by the local Collector of <ORG> or Deputy Director of Enforcement who has sponsored the detention and this too would seem to be an unreasonable procedural requirement because in order to secure the presence of such officer at the interview the District Magistrate Delhi would have to fix the time for the interview in consultation with the Collector of <ORG> or the Deputy Director of Enforcement and it may become difficult to synchronise the time which suits the legal adviser with the time convenient to the concerned officer and furthermore if the nominated officer does not for any reason attend at the appointed time as seems to have happened on quite a few occasions in the case of the petitioner the interview cannot be held at all and the legal adviser would have to go back without meeting the detenu and the entire procedure for applying for an appointment to the District Magistrate Delhi would have to be gone through once again We may point out that no satisfactory explanation has been given on behalf of the respondents disclosing the rationale of this requirement We accordingly allow the writ petition and grant relief to the extent indicated above
