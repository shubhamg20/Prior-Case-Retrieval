The petitioners were thereupon charged before the Chief Presidency Magistrate with having committed an offence under Section A of the I The defence taken was that they published the telegram to draw the attention of the authorities to a piece of information received from a reliable source so that they might trace the persons responsible for the disturbances and find some means of securing peace between the two communities But having regard to the circumstances of the case he came to the conclusion that it would be sufficient to deal with the petitioners under Section of the Criminal and dismissed them with a warning not to publish rumours of this nature in future particularly at a time of tension Now the defence taken by the petitioners was that this item of news was base upon a telegram which had been actually received in Calcutta from Mauritius and the telegraph officer has produced the original in Court and is signed by <NAME> Mr <NAME> who has appeared for the petitioners construes this message as meaning that the writer was shortly starting for Calcutta by the steamer Naringa and was bringing money with him to feed Mirzapuris by which he means goondas if that is the correct interpretation of the message the question is whether the editor of a paper is justified in translating it into the words which find expression in the paper The learned Magistrate has expressed his view in this way If the accused honestly thought there was anything in it requiring investigation he could have given particulars of his information to the police The explanation says that it does not amount to an offence within the meaning of this section to point out without malicious intention and with an honest view to their removal matters which are producing or have a tendency to produce feelings of enmity or hatred between different classes of His Majesty subjects <NAME> makes the following observations In substance my opinion of this case he is referring to the prosecution of the paper Forward is that the newspaper here has given its readers in the ordinary way a perfectly legitimate and sensible piece of news without any intention to utilize that piece of news for the purpose of promoting or furthering class hatred and that even if the news is of such a character that it is possible to suppose that some people reading it may momentarily or foolishly be induced to entertain unreasonable feeling towards a class of other people this is not enough to bring it within the mischief either of Section A of the I or Section of the Criminal Applying that test to the present case we are of opinion that there is no indication of any such intention as to bring the case within the purview of Section A Learned Counsel for the Crown has contended that that is not enough but that the petitioners must also show that the publication was with an honest view to remove certain matters which have a tendency to produce feelings of enmity between the various classes If there is no malicious intention in the publication we think honesty of purpose may safely be inferred Upon the facts found in the present case we are not satisfied that the action taken by the Magistrate in dealing with the petitioners was necessary The order made under Section should be vacated The rule is accordingly made absolute
