These appeals by <ORG> are directed against the judgment of <ORG> Certificates under Articles and of the Constitution for leave to appeal to <ORG> having been granted by <ORG> itself By the impugned judgment <ORG> came to the conclusion that the action of <ORG> in taking over the managements of the three Cotton Mills namely <ORG> <ORG> and <ORG> of Bombay under the provisions of Textile Undertakings Taking over of Management Ordinance hereinafter referred to as The Ordinance and the Textile Undertakings Taking over of Management Act hereinafter referred to as The Act infringed the fundamental right under Article of the Constitution and therefore qua them it was invalid <ORG> also further came to hold that the Act infringed the petitioners fundamental rights under Article and on that count qua the petitioner was equally invalid In coming to the aforesaid conclusion <ORG> after thorough discussion of the materials on record found that <ORG> failed to establish either directly or inferentially any mis management on the part of the three companies and failed to establish from the material on record that there was any nexus between the main object or purpose of the Act viz The three <ORG> with which we are concerned in these appeals had been included in category III On th September <ORG> in <ORG> had issued a Memorandum constituting a <ORG> to collect data and submit a note for being placed before <ORG> of <ORG> to enable it to take a decision as to which of the <ORG> in category III would be Nationalised Immediately after the promulgation of the Ordinance the Management of the <ORG> enumerated in the First Schedule thereof having been taken over by the Government the three <ORG> referred to earlier filed three Writ Petitions in Bombay High Court challenging the applicability of the Ordinance so far as those <ORG> are concerned <ORG> in the impugned judgment made elaborate discussion of the materials on record as well as interpreted the different provisions of the Constitution and came to hold that the act with its object of only taking over the management cannot be considered to be law for taking over the ownership and control of the property as required under Article but would squarely fall under Article A and therefore Article will have no application <ORG> also came to the conclusion that to protect a legislation under Article there must be a declaration in the legislation itself that the Act was enacted to give effect to the Directive Principles under Article and and in the case in hand there being no such declaration either in the Ordinance and in the Act Article will have no application and squarely the challenge on the ground of violation of Article or has to be examined On examining Article A <ORG> was of the opinion that two conditions must be satisfied for attracting Clause of Article A namely that the taking over of the management of the property by the <ORG> would be for a limited period and such taking over must be either in public interest or in order to secure the proper management of the property since the taking over of management was not for any limited period and in fact such management had been taken over pending nationalisation the provisions of Clause of Article A would not get attracted According to <ORG> the expression Pending Nationalisation cannot be held to be for a limited period and the protection of Article A would be available only when there is a definite limit in the law for the period of management and consequently the challenge on the anvil of violation of Articles and has to be examined <ORG> then examined the factual aspect for considering the question as to whether there were any materials to put the three <ORG> in a class of <ORG> for which the taking over of the management was meant notwithstanding a declaration or recital in the Preamble itself the same being <ORG> whose financial condition had become wholly unsatisfactory by reason of mis management <ORG> then examined the different datas collected by <ORG> as well as several reports including the <ORG> Report and ultimately came to the conclusion that even though the financial condition had become unsatisfactory but the Union Government has failed to establish that such unsatisfactory financial condition is by reason of mis management and therefore there was no nexus between the basis of the classification of the petitioner <ORG> with other mismanaged <ORG> and the said object and the purpose of the Act When the matter was listed before this Court the aforesaid interim order staying the operation of the judgment was continued and later on certain Misc Applications being filed by different <ORG> certain orders have been passed by the Court with regard to the possession of certain assets like car telephone connections etc When the appeals were taken up for hearing in January the same had been heard before <ORG> but after hearing for some time <ORG> felt that in view of the questions which arise for consideration and in view of Clause of Article of the Constitution the cases should be heard by a Bench of not less than Five Honble Judges and that is why these appeals were heard by us According to Mr <NAME> this is apparent from the Bill introduced by the concerned Minister as well as the Act itself and in such a case the <ORG> would not be justified in examining the datas which persuaded the <ORG> to take the aforesaid decision to come to a conclusion that the said decision of the <ORG> could not have been taken on the available materials The learned Solicitor General also placed reliance on the averments made by <ORG> in its Counter Affidavit filed before <ORG> to indicate how it was absolutely necessary to promulgate the Ordinance and how the <ORG> took the decision after considering the reports submitted by the <ORG> and other financial institutions as well as the report of the so called <ORG> He also placed reliance on the Affidavit of Mr <NAME> the then Secretary <ORG> explaining the <ORG> Report and contended that <ORG> was in error in basing its conclusion on the earlier Affidavit of one Mr <NAME> According to learned Solicitor General that while considering the constitutional validity of a statute more particularly a statute on economic matter certain well established principles evolved by the <ORG> as rules of guidance in discharge of its constitutional function of judicial review have to be borne in mind and in the case in hand the impugned judgment of <ORG> on the face of it indicates that those guiding principles have not been borne in mind According to the learned Solicitor General one cardinal principle well accepted and recognized by <ORG> is that the legislature understands and correctly appreciates the needs of its own people and its laws are directed to problems made manifest by experience and its discrimination are based on adequate grounds and the presumption of constitutionality is indeed so strong that in order to sustain it the <ORG> may take into consideration matters of common knowledge matters of common report the history of the times and may assume every state of facts which can be conceived existing at the time of legislation He further emphasised that the law relating to economic activities should be viewed with greater latitude than laws touching civil rights such as freedom of speech religion etc It no doubt further stipulates that by reason of mis management of the affairs of the Textile Undertakings specified in the First Schedule their financial condition became wholly unsatisfactory but the financial condition of these <ORG> had become so precarious and unsatisfactory as was found from the reports of different financial institutions including <ORG> that mis management is the natural inference and the preamble read as a whole would indicate that the <ORG> thought it appropriate to take over the management of Textile Undertakings in the public interest pending nationalisation of such undertaking and in this view of the matter <ORG> was hyper technical in recording a finding that even though the financial condition become wholly unsatisfactory but the <ORG> failed to establish the mis management of the undertaking which had brought the financial condition to such unsatisfactory stage and therefore by including the three mills in question in the group of there has been violation of Article The learned Solicitor General also urged that in view of the prevailing situation in the <ORG> including the three with which we are concerned in these appeals the <ORG> thought that only way to put the management on the wheels was to take over the management of the <ORG> which is permissible in the larger public interest as contained in Article A of the Constitution and such <ORG>ary wisdom cannot be scrutinised by the <ORG> in a scale on the basis that certain reports might not have been placed before the <ORG> or on the ground that factually the <ORG> were not mis managed and yet had sustained heavy financial loss and thereby putting them alongwith the group of constitutes an infraction of Article of the Constitution According to the learned Solicitor General the burden being on a person who attacks the constitutionality on the grounds of discrimination the said burden cannot be held to have been discharged by the <ORG> and <ORG> committed serious error in annulling the taking over of the management of the three <ORG> under the Act on the ground that <ORG> failed to establish the relevant material before the <ORG> The learned Solicitor General also argued that Article does apply to the legislation in question and therefore infraction of Article or should not have been gone into by the <ORG> Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing for <ORG> emphatically urged that Article A was introduced by the Constitution IVth Amendment Act of which enables to make law for taking over of the management of any property by the <ORG> for a limited period either in the public interest or in order to secure proper management of the same The said law permits take over only when the financial condition became unsatisfactory by reason of mis management of the affairs of <ORG> And this being the position if there is no material to establish that financial losses is on account of mis management then the taking over of the management of the mill by taking recourse to the impugned Act must be held to be invalid and <ORG> in fact has held it to be invalid According to Mr <NAME> mere losses will not entitle to take over of the management of mill inasmuch as all the mills have suffered loss and therefore there must be some other factors on account of which it will be possible for the Government to take over the management of only mills as included in the First Schedule to the Act He also further urged that in view of the language of Article A the law for taking over of the management must be for a limited period and the expression pending nationalisation in the impugned Act cannot be construed to be a definite limited period and therefore the Act in question is not referable to Article A It is in this connection he cited the decision of <NAME> as well as the decision of <ORG> in ILR Delhi and also a decision of <ORG> in AIR A Mr <NAME> also argued that in the impugned Act there is intrinsic evidence to indicate that the taking over of management was not for a limited period as it would be apparent from Sections and Sections and and essentially it constitutes acquisition and not take over of management for a limited period Mr <NAME> also urged that the legislative declaration of facts are not beyond judicial scrutiny in the constitutional context of Articles and and the <ORG> can always tear the veil to decide the real nature of the statute if the facts and circumstances warrant such a course If the legislation in question was merely a pretence and the object was discrimination the validity of the statute could be examined by the <ORG> notwithstanding the declaration made by the legislature and therefore <ORG> was fully justified in examining the facts and coming to the conclusion that in grouping the three mills alongwith other mills for the purpose of taking over the management constitutes an infraction of Article of the Constitution According to Mr <NAME> categorisation of the <ORG> mill as a mis managed mill is contrary to the facts available on record and as such it violates Article Mr RF <NAME> also contended that it was open for the Writ Petitioners to place and establish that the legislative facts are incorrect and in fact the petitioners have discharged that burden by placing materials on record and <ORG> therefore was fully justified in arriving at its decision on the materials produced Mr <NAME> learned counsel appearing for <ORG> contended that <ORG> itself has given a positive finding on the basis of the materials those have been produced that the performance of the mill was good In view of the rival submissions the following questions arise for our consideration Can the impugned Act be held to be a law providing for the taking over of the management of the Mills for a limited period The Act read as a whole expresses the intention of the <ORG> for taking over the management of the Textile Undertakings specified in the First Schedule in the public interest or is it capable of indicating the legislative intent that only those Mills whose financial condition became wholly unsatisfactory by reasons of mis management of the affairs of the Textile Undertakings which are sought to be specified in the First Schedule and management of those Mills are being taken over under the Act There is always a presumption that the legislature does not exceed its jurisdiction and the burden of establishing that the legislature has transgressed constitutional mandates such as those relating to fundamental rights is always on the person who challenges its vires The aforesaid principle however is subject to one exception that if a citizen is able to establish that the legislation has invaded its fundamental rights then the <ORG> must justify that the law is saved The deponents of the affidavits filed into the court may speak for the parties on whose behalf they swear to the statements The executive Government may place before the court their understanding of what <ORG> has said or intended to say or what they think was <ORG>s object and all the facts and circumstances which in their view led to the legislation No Act of <ORG> may be struck down because of the understanding or misunderstanding of parliamentary intention by the executive Government or because their spokesmen do not bring out relevant circumstances but indulge in empty and self defeating affidavits They do not and they cannot bind <ORG> Validity of legislation is not to be judged merely by affidavits filed on behalf of the <ORG> but by all the relevant circumstances which the court may ultimately find and more especially by what may be gathered from what the legislature has itself said In the facts of that case the <ORG> had held that We do not entertain the slightest doubt that the nationalisation of the coking coal mines and the specified coke oven plants for the above purpose was towards securing that the ownership and control of the material resources of the community are so distributed as best to subserve the common good and there has been no discrimination or infringement of Article of the Constitution <NAME> in his separate judgment also agreed with the ultimate conclusion of <NAME> and had said that there was logical basis for the nationalisation of the oven plants of the petitioners leaving out a few and I am not satisfied that there has been any wrong and arbitrary discrimination of Article of the Constitution While examining the constitutional validity of the special courts bill in the anvil of Article of the Constitution after an exhaustive review of all the decisions bearing on the question in it was held as follows The constitutional command to the State to afford equal protection of its laws sets a goal not attainable by the invention and application of a precise formula Therefore classification need not be constituted by an exact or scientific exclusion or inclusion of persons or things The courts should not insist on delusive exactness or apply doctrinaire tests for determining the validity of classification in any given case The principle underlying the guarantee of Article is not that the same rules of law should be applicable to all persons within the Indian territory or that the same remedies should be made available to them irrespective of differences of circumstances It only means that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike both in privileges conferred and liabilities imposed Equal laws would have to be applied to all in the same situation and there should be no discrimination between one person and another if as regards the subject matter of the legislation their position is substantially the same It can recognise even degree of evil but the classification should never be arbitrary artificial or evasive The classification must not be arbitrary but must be rational that is to say it must not only be based on some qualities or characteristics which are to be found in all the persons grouped together and not in others who are left out but those qualities or characteristics must have a reasonable relation to the object of the legislation In order to pass the test two conditions must be fulfilled namely that the classification must be founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes those that are grouped together from others and that that differentia must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the Act The interpreter of the statute must take note of the well known historical facts In conventional language the interpreter must put himself in the armchair of those who were passing the Act i the Members of the <ORG> The aforesaid observation had been made in the context of an argument sought for by the petitioner for production of certain documents to ascertain the question whether the shares vested in the <ORG> or not In Bearer Bonds case <ORG> Cases this <ORG> held that it is a rule of equal importance that laws relating to economic activities should be viewed with greater latitude than law touching civil rights such as freedom of speech religion etc The <ORG> observed that It has been said by no less a person than <NAME> that the legislature should be allowed some play in the joints because it has to deal with complex problems which do not admit of solution through any doctrinaire or strait jacket formula and this is particularly true in case of legislation dealing with economic matters where having regard to the nature of the problems required to be dealt with greater play in the joints has to be allowed to the legislature Nowhere has this admonition been more felicitously expressed than in <NAME> <NAME> US Ed where <NAME> said in his intimitable style In the utilities tax and economic regulation cases there are good reasons for judicial self restraint if not judicial deference to legislative judgment The legislature after all has the affirmative responsibility The courts have only the power to destroy not to reconstruct the uncertainty the liability to error the bewildering conflict of the experts and the number of times the judges have been overruled by events self limitation can be seen to be the path to judicial wisdom and institutional prestige and stability The <ORG> must always remember that legislation is directed to practical problems that the economic mechanism is highly sensitive and complex that many problems are singular and contingent that laws are not abstrct propositions and do not relate to abstract units and are not to be measured by abstract symmetry that exact wisdom and nice adaption of remedy are not always possible and that judgment is largely a prophecy based on meagre and uninterpreted experience Every legislation particularly in economic matters is essentially empiric and it is based on experimentation or what one may call trial and error method and therefore it cannot provide for all possible situations or anticipate all possible abuses There may even be possibilities of abuse but that too cannot of itself be a ground for invalidating the legislation because it is not possible for any legislature to anticipate as if by some divine prescience distortions and abuses of its legislation which may be made by those subject to its provisions and to provide against such distortions and abuses The <ORG> must therefore adjudge the constitutionality of such legislation by the generality of its provisions and not by its crudities or inequities or by the possibilities of abuse of any of its provisions this Court held a xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx that there is always a presumption in favour of the constitutionality of an enactment and the burden is upon him who attacks it to show that there has been a clear transgression of the constitutional principles that it must be presumed that the legislature understands and correctly appreciates the need of its own people that its laws are directed to problems made manifest by experience and that its discriminations are based on adequate grounds that the legislature is free to recognise derees of harm and may confine its restrictions to those cases where the need is deemed to be the clearest that in order to sustain the presumption of constitutionality the court may take into consideration matters of common knowledge matters of common report the history of the times and may assume every state of facts which can be conceived existing at the time of legislation this Court held The preamble provides the key to the general purpose of the Act The general purpose or object of the Act given in the preamble may not show the specific purpose of the classification made in Section a and Section A For achieving this the <ORG> may not only consider the language of Section but also other public knowledge about the evil sought to be remedied the prior law the statement of the purpose of the change in the prior law and the internal legislative history When the purpose of a challenged classification is in doubt the court attribute to the classification the purpose thought to be most probable The decisions dealing with economic regulation indicate that courts have used the concept of purpose and similar situations in a manner which give considerable leeway to the <ORG> This approach of judicial restraint and presumption of constitutionality requires that the <ORG> is given the benefit of doubt about its purpose How far a court will go in attributing a purpose which though perhaps not the probable is at least conceivable and which would allow the classification to stand depends to a certain extent upon its imaginative power and its devotion to the theory of judicial restraint The <ORG> further held It would seem that in fiscal and regulatory matters the <ORG> not only entertains a greater presumption of constitutionality but also places the burden on the party challenging its validity to show that it has no reasonable basis for making the classification The Legislation is primarily directed to the problems before the legislature based on information derived from past and present experience But from the very nature of things it is impossible to anticipate fully the varied situations arising in future in which the application of the legislation in hand may be called for and words chosen to communicate such indefinite reference are bound to be in many cases lacking in clarity and precision and thus giving rise to the controversial question of construction Bearing in mind the aforesaid general principles let us now examine the five questions formulated earlier Coming to the first question the contention of the Companies who were the petitioners before <ORG> is that under Article A a law providing for taking over of the management of any property by the State for a limited period either in the public interest or in order to secure the proper management of the property cannot be assailed on the ground of violation of Article or but the impugned ordinance and the Act cannot be held to be a law for providing for taking over of the management for a limited period even though the same may be in the public interest and as such such a law cannot be held to be immune from attack being violative of Article or within the ambit of Article A of the Constitution This argument found favour with <ORG> and following the decision of this <ORG> in <NAME> case <ORG> held that the legislation in question cannot be held to be within the purview of Article A of the Constitution Mr <NAME> the learned Solicitor General appearing for <ORG> contended before us that it is the usual pattern of taking over of such undertaking to take over the management immediately by a law made by the appropriate legislature and since it was apparent at the time of enactment of the law that the taking over of the management is pending nationalisation which had been embodied in the legislation itself such take over of the management must be held to be for a limited period and the observations of this <ORG> in Raman lal must be construed in the context of the facts of the said case and will have no application to the facts and circumstances of the present case Mr <NAME> the learned senior counsel appearing for one of the mills on the other hand contended that the expression pending nationalisation by no stretch of imagination can be held to be a definite period and this has been answered directly in the case of <ORG> and <ORG> According to Mr <NAME> there is intrinsic evidence in the impugned Act itself that the so called taking over was not for a limited period as is apparent from examining Sections Section Section and Section of the Act The further amendment of the Constitution was made by Fourth Amendment Act of with the object that items of agrarian and social welfare legislation which affect the proprietary rights should be kept out of the purview of Articles and Clause of Article A provides for taking over the management of any property movable or immovable agricultural or non agricultural for a limited period without being obliged to justify its action in a <ORG> of law with reference to Article or The necessary conditions for application of sub clause therefore are that the taking over in question must be for a limited period as distinguished from any indefinite period and such taking over must be either in the public interest or in order to secure the proper management of the property which of course require to be objectively established This <ORG> considering the provisions of the Act and the rules made thereunder came to the conclusion that even though there may be a possibility of return of the land to the original owner but that does not satisfy the requirement of Article A as the taking over of the management was not for a limited period But as the process of nationalisation would take a considerable period and it was thought absolutely necessary in the public interest to take over the management of the mills immediately the <ORG> passed the impugned legislation It is to be noticed that <ORG> which was also one of the mills in category III and had been put in Group II by <ORG> whose management had been taken over under the provisions of Textile Undertakings Taking over of Management Act had approached <ORG> and <ORG> had upheld the action of taking over but had held that the surplus lands appurtenant to the mills would not vest under sub section of Section of the Act but this <ORG> had reversed the said decision and had held that the surplus lands appurtenant to the mill did form a part of the assets in relation to the textile undertaking within the meaning of Section of the Act and the said land was held for the benefit of and utilised for the textile mill in question Before this <ORG> it is true that the question of applicability of Article A had not cropped up for consideration but yet certain observations of this <ORG> in the aforesaid case would be appropriate to be quoted There can be no doubt that the legislative intent and object of the impugned Act was to secure the socialisation of such surplus lands with a view to sustain the sick textile undertakings so that they could be properly utilised by the <ORG> for social good i in resuscitating the dying textile undertakings Hence a paradoxical situation should have been avoided by adding a narrow and pedantic construction of a provision like sub section of Section of the Act which provides for the consequences that ensue upon the taking over in public interest of the management of a textile undertaking under sub section thereof as a step towards nationalisation of such undertakings which was clearly against the national interest In dealing with similar legislation this <ORG> has always adopted a broad and liberal approach <ORG> has no doubt in The <ORG> case considered the applicability of Article A and held that taking over of the management pending nationalisation cannot be held to be for a limited period since there is no question of returning the property to the old management but we are unable to accept this view of <ORG> and we hold that the views expressed therein are not correct in law Having regard to the conditions of these mills at the time of taking over of the management and having regard to the decision of <ORG> on the basis of data and materials to nationalise the mills falling under category III and the ultimate policy decision of the <ORG> to achieve the process of nationalisation in two stages first by taking over the management of the textile undertakings and thereafter enact suitable legislation to nationalise the same the ultimate legislation for taking over the management of the mills passed by the <ORG> cannot but be held to be a law providing for taking over of the management for a limited period in public interest and as such the said law comes within the purview of Article A of the Constitution Once it is held that the law is one attracting Article A of the Constitution then the validity of the said law cannot be assailed on the ground of violation of Articles and of the Constitution But since elaborate arguments had been advanced we would also examine the other questions posed by us So far as the second question is concerned the entire emphasis of the arguments advanced on behalf of <ORG> persuaded <ORG> and <ORG> in fact came to the conclusion in paragraph of the impugned judgment that the provisions of the Act read with its objects and reasons and the preamble go to show that in the context of things the term mismanagement has been used in the impugned Act not as indicating mere bad or incompetent or poor management as contended by the learned counsel for <ORG> but meant mismanagement having an element of fraud or dishonesty Thereafter <ORG> examined different affidavits and materials and came to the conclusion that the question of management of the mills had no where been discussed or dealt with either directly or indirectly and that the existence of bad financial condition was in fact a general phenomena during the said period amongst <ORG> in Bombay and the same by itself anything more could not have been an indication of bad inadequate management In paragraph of the impugned judgment the learned Judges came to the ultimate conclusion In our view therefore all the circumstances mentioned above by the learned counsel for <ORG> do not bring out either directly or inferentially any mis management on the part of the petitioner company but on the contrary the fact that the said circumstances existed even in case of some of <ORG> and <ORG>I Mills show that the Government could not have considered the said circumstances for concluding that the said <ORG> were mismanaged or their financial condition was wholly unsatisfactory by reason of such mismanagement The learned Judges then held that there was no nexus between the main object or purpose of the Act to take over the management of only those <ORG> whose financial condition before strike was wholly unsatisfactory by reason of mis management We have examined the impugned Act carefully and we fail to understand that how <ORG> could come to a conclusion that the expression mis management has been used to indicate an element of fraud and dis honesty whereas in fact neither the provisions of the Act nor the object or preamble have indicated any such intention There is no doubt a marginal area in which the courts mould or creatively interpret legislation and they are thus finishers refiners and polishers of legislation which comes to them in a state requiring varying degrees of further processing It is therefore a cardinal principle of construction of statute that the true or legal meaning of an enactment is derived by considering the meaning of the words used in the enactment in the light of any discernible purpose or object which comprehends the mischief and its remedy to which the enactment is directed Applying the aforesaid principle we really fail to understand as to how the learned judges of <ORG> could come to a conclusion that the mismanagement must necessarily mean an element of fraud or dishonesty Caution is all the more necessary in dealing with a legislation enacted to give effect to policies that are subject to bitter public and parliamentary controversy for in controversial matters there is room for differences of opinion as to what is expedient what is just and what is morally justifiable it is the <ORG>s opinion in these matters that is paramount It has been held in several cases that a long title along with preamble or even in its absence is a good guide regarding the object scope or purpose of the Act whereas the preamble being only an abbreviation for purposes of reference is not a useful aid to construction The preamble of an Act no doubt can also be read along with other provisions of the Act to find out the meaning of the words in enacting provisions to decide whether they are clear or ambiguous but the preamble in itself not being an enacting provision is not of the same weight as an aid to construction of a Section of the Act as are other relevant enacting words to be found elsewhere in the Act It is therefore said that the preamble is not to influence the meaning otherwise ascribable to the enacting parts unless there is a compelling reason for it Again where very general language is used in an enactment which it is clear must be intended to have a limited application the preamble may be used to indicate to what particular instances the enactment is intended to apply We cannot therefore start with the preamble for construing the provisions of an Act though we could be justified in resorting to it nay we will be required to do so if we find that the language used by <ORG> is ambiguous or is too general though in point of fact <ORG> intended that it should have a limited application In Coal Bearing Areas Acquisition and Development Act the Court was construing a Notification issued under Section of the said Act and as in the present case the preamble of that Act was to the effect An Act to establish in the economic interest of India greater public control over the coal mining industry and its development by providing for the acquisition by the <ORG> of unworked land containing or likely to contain coal deposits or of right in or over such land for the extinguishment or modification of such rights accruing by virtue of any agreement lease license or otherwise and for matters connected therewith Repelling an argument advanced on behalf of the Mine owners that the Act intended to apply only to virgin land and not on the land which are being worked or were worked in the past because of the use of the words unworked land in the preamble this Court held that the language of the enacting provisions was clear and therefore not controlled by the preamble This being the position and the Textile Undertakings Taking Over of the Management Act being an Act providing for taking over in the public interest of the Management of Textile Undertakings of the Companies specified in the First Schedule pending nationalisation of such undertakings and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto as is apparent from the long title use of the expression mis management of the affairs in the preamble will not control the purpose of the Act namely the public interest and the <ORG> having decided to take over the management of the Textile <ORG> which were in serious financial crisis in the public interest it was not open for the Court to come to a conclusion by taking recourse to the use of the word mis management in the preamble to hold that the <ORG> intended only to take those <ORG> whose financial condition was deplorable on account of mismanagement and not in case of those mills where the financial condition may be deplorable but not on account of mis management Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel had strongly relied upon the decision of this <ORG> in Madras Race <ORG> case <ORG> whereunder the <ORG> struck down the provisions of Madras Race <ORG> Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings Act on a conclusion that the declaration made in the Act that the Act was made to implement Article was a mere cloak and there was no nexus between the Act and the objects contained in Article and as such the Act is arbitrary In the Madras case the objects and reasons as indicated in the Act was that the acquisition is for a public purpose but in fact there was no material to show that any inquiry or investigation had been held by <ORG> in the affairs of the <ORG> and the <ORG> held that no public purpose is being served by the acquisition and transfer of the undertaking of the <ORG> by the <ORG> But in the case in hand as has been noticed by this <ORG> in Sitaram Mills Case the <ORG> had before it several viability surveys made by different authorities like <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> and <ORG> and an independent survey by the <ORG> itself These surveys had been directed in ascertaining whether companies textile undertaking was a techno economically viable unit or not and whether it was desirable to provide the company with the working capital On the basis of all these informations it was decided as a matter of policy that it was desirable to achieve the process of nationalisation initially by taking over the management of the mills and thereafter by enacting suitable legislation to nationalise the same The objects and reasons of the Act unequivocally indicated that the basic decision of nationalisation having been taken a genuine apprehension having arisen in the <ORG>s mind that unless the management of the concerned undertakings was taken over on immediate basis there might be large scale flittering away of assets which would be detrimental to the public interest and it thus became urgently necessary for <ORG> to take over the management of the undertakings in the public interest In this state of affairs we have no doubt in our mind that the decision in Madras Race <ORG> case will have no application to the case in hand In the case in hand <ORG> appears to have examined in detail the functioning of each of these three mills which had filed Writ Petition before it for ascertaining whether the financial conditions of those mills had deteriorated because of the strike or on account of mis management and on scrutiny of different materials came to hold that <ORG> has failed to establish the case of mis management which in turn would mean a case of fraud and dishonesty on the part of those who were in management of the mills That apart when an Act has been made by the <ORG> as the <ORG> thought the taking over of the management of the Textile Mills pending their nationalisation would be in the public interest it was not open for a <ORG> in exercise of its power of judicial review to have in depth examination of different facts and circumstances and record a conclusion as has been done in the case in hand by <ORG> concerned These principles will have no application to a legislation of the present nature where the <ORG> itself had already taken a decision to nationalise the Textile Mills which had undergone severe financial crisis and such mills could not be re started without pumping in large amount of money from the public exchequer and therefore the legislation in question was passed to take over the management of the mills immediately as such take over was in the public interest The argument advanced on behalf of the mills and the microscopic examination of datas by the <ORG> for arriving at a conclusion as to the alleged violation of Article of the Constitution is not permissible and will not override the legislative intent behind taking over of management of the mills in the larger public interest We are unable to agree with the arguments advanced on behalf of the counsel appearing for the respondents that by picking up the three mills who had approached <ORG> and clubbing them together with other mills in the Fist Schedule the Government did not have germane considerations before it in fact it is not the Executive Government but the <ORG> itself had chosen to take over the management of the mills included in the First Schedule to the impugned Act and for that purpose the impugned legislation was enacted and the management of the mills could be taken over by operation of law Supreme <ORG> Cases that the Textile Mills and <ORG> in India has played an important role in the growth of national economy Its importance in the industrial field is because of the fact that it produces an essential commodity and the export of such commodity helps in building up the foreign exchange reserve of the country simultaneously the industry gives employment to a large number of persons This <ORG> had also taken note of the fact that <ORG> was required to evolve a scheme to put <ORG> on its rail and therefore after getting the matter investigated by committee and after recommending that <ORG> and <ORG> should finance and put through expeditiously the re habilitation programme and having accepted the categorisation made in the meeting called by <ORG> on October and having realised that none of the mills in Category III could be expected to survive on a sound basis without financial assistance from the Government controlled Institutions and <ORG>s and thereafter obtaining a detailed Viability Report from the <ORG> and <ORG> which was constituted by <ORG> the Government decided that the Mills in question should be re habilitated by injecting public funds but since the management of the mills has been defective in as much as had there been no mis management the mills would not be found themselves in the conditions in which they were even before the general strike As the matter of policy it was desirable to achieve the process of nationalisation in two stages taking over of the management and thereafter suitable legislation to nantionalise the same and the taking over of management was with a view to implement the decision of nationalisation The fact that in some of the Reports indicating viability of the mills on large scale money being pumped in would not in any way affect the ultimate conclusion of the <ORG> in providing for a law to take over in the public interest the management of Textile Undertakings of the Companies specified in the First Schedule as the danger of pumping in of large sum from the public exchequer without taking over the management of the mills would not have been a prudent action As has been stated earlier and as is apparent from the long title of the Act itself that the decision to nationalise the mills had already been taken but pending nationalisation the mills in question including the mills of the three petitioners who filed Writ Petition Bombay High <ORG> the management was taken over by the impugned legislation as otherwise there was imminent danger to the finance to be pumped in to the for its revival and revival was necessary to provide employment to the large number of mill workers In the aforesaid premises we have no hesitation to come to a conclusion on the materials on record the <ORG>ary action in legislating the law and taking over of the management of all the mills included in the First Schedule to the Act cannot be held to be discriminatory nor <ORG> was justified in recording a conclusion about the true intention of the legislation that it is only the mis managed mills whose financial condition had deteriorated the management of those to be taken over and not others In other words while the Act of taking over of the management of the mills was in the public interest the inference of mis management was the inference of the <ORG> duly arrived at from the fact that the financial condition of the mills had become wholly unsatisfactory even before the commencement in January and such financial condition has further deteriorated thereafter This inference of the <ORG> is not subject to a mathematical judicial scrutiny and the way in which <ORG> has gone into this question in the impugned judgment is certainly not within the para meters of the power of High <ORG> under Article of the Constitution So far as the fifth question is concerned though it is no doubt true that the <ORG> would be justified to some extent in examining the materials for finding out the true legislative intent engrafted in a Statute but the same would be done only when the Statute itself is ambiguous or a particular meaning given to a particular provision of the Statute it would make the Statute unworkable or the very purpose of enacting the Statute would get frustrated As has been stated earlier in the case in hand the Taking over of Management Statute of had been engrafted in the public interest as the legislature found that there is imperative need to take over of the management of the companies until the process of nationalisation is finalised The preamble further indicates that the process of acquisition would take a longer time and to enable <ORG> to invest large sum of money it was necessary in the public interest to take over the management of the undertakings Apart from answering the five points formulated by us we may also deal with some other ancillary points which have been raised in course of arguments but we find from the impugned judgment that the said contention had not been pressed before <ORG> and therefore we are not called upon to examine the contention to find out whether the Act can be held to be reasonable and fair This being the position Article A will have no application In the aforesaid case the <ORG> was considering the validity of the notification issued by <ORG> in canceling the confirmation of the bye laws made by Jabalpur Municipality in so far as the bye laws relate to slaughter of bulls and bullocks This <ORG> had observed that the <ORG> in considering the validity of the impugned law imposing a prohibition on the carrying on of a business or profession attempt an evaluation of its direct and immediate impact upon the fundamental rights of the citizens affected thereby and the larger public interest sought to be ensured in the light of the object sought to be achieved the necessity to restrict the citizens freedom the inherent pernicious nature of the act prohibited or its capacity or tendency to be harmful to the general public the possibility of achieving the object by imposing a less drastic restraint and in the absence of exceptional situations such as the prevalence of a state of emergency national or local or the necessity to maintain essential supplies or the necessity to stop activities inherently dangerous the existence of a machinery to satisfy the administrative authority that no case for imposing the restriction is made out or that a less drastic restriction may ensure the object intended to be achieved It is these observations on which Mr <NAME> strongly relied upon since in the case in hand the appropriate <ORG> did not take any action under the provisions of the Companies Act nor there had been any investigation as provided under Section and A of the Industrial Development and Regulation Act according to Mr <NAME> obviously those provisions are less drastic in nature than the impugned Act and in fact there was no urgent necessity for enacting a law and taking a drastic measure of taking over the management of the mills We are unable to accept this contention since we have already discussed the public interest involved and how the <ORG> thought of taking over the management of the mills without which it would not be feasible to pump in large sums of money from the public exchequer and leave the management with the erstwhile managers for whose mismanagement the mills would not have been in the situation in which the law was enacted The decision to take over the management of the mills with a view to implement the decision to nationalise the mills being the basis for enactment of the Taking Over of the Management of the Mills Act question of taking recourse to the remedies available under the Companies Act or Industries Development and Regulation Act really do not arise and on that score it cannot be said that there has been a violation of Article We may reiterate that we are examining the enactment of a law by the <ORG> itself and the wisdom of the <ORG> in taking a decision to take over the management of the mills in the larger public interest and not an executive decision of the <ORG> which could have taken recourse to some other remedial measure provided under the Industries Development and Regulation Act or the Companies Act If <ORG> decides to enact a law for taking over the management of <ORG> pending completion of the process of nationalisation on a genuine apprehension that there might be a large scale flittering away of assets if the management is not taken over and that would be grossly detrimental to the public interest it would not be open for the <ORG> to examine the question whether other remedies could have been taken and not being taken there has been an infraction of Article In the aforesaid premises we have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the High <ORG> was in error to hold that there has been an infraction of Article in the case in hand In view of our conclusions as aforesaid we do not propose to examine the contention of the learned Solicitor General with regard to the applicability of Article of the Constitution which he had raised in course of his arguments The impugned judgment of <ORG> is set aside and the writ petitions filed before the <ORG> stand dismissed During the pendency of these appeals this Court had passed some interim orders with regard to possession of certain land and other assets as well as with regard to cars and telephone connections But <ORG> in its Writ Petition No of having made a specific case that notwithstanding the Act being valid and the management of the mills can be taken over and its properties and assets vest with <ORG> under Section of the Act but there are certain other assets which cannot be held to form a part of the assets of <ORG> and therefore cannot be taken over <ORG> has not considered this question as the Act itself was struck down but it would be meet and proper for <ORG> now to consider the same bearing in mind the law laid down by this Court in <ORG> case interpreting the provisions of Section of the Act on the materials to be produced by the parties Be it stated that until a decision is given by <ORG> on this score by virtue of operation of law all the assets would stand vested and such vesting would be subject to a final decision of <ORG> in respect of any of these so called assets which the petitioner establishes not to be an asset of <ORG> notwithstanding the wider meaning given to Section in <ORG> case
