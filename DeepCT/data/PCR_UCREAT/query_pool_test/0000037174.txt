This matter concerns an assortment of questions regarding the interpretation and constitutionality of certain provisions of the Maharashtra Control of Organized Crime Act and as such calls for our utmost attention particularly in view of the fact that this legislation although widely used for maintaining law and order has also generated some controversy alleging its sweeping powers Since its enactment in it has found favour with the law enforcement officials and has been enthusiastically applied wherever possible by the law enforcement agencies and the concerned <ORG> These three appeals have been filed by the appellants herein to assail the common judgment and order dated rendered by <ORG> at Bombay in Writ Petition No of whereby <ORG> dismissed the Writ Petition filed by the appellants herein The appellants herein challenged before <ORG> the constitutional validity of that part of Section of the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act MCOCA hereinafter which refers to insurgency Before we proceed to discuss and deal with the issue at hand it will be prudent to address an issue that goes to the very root of the jurisdiction of this <ORG> to entertain the present appeal In the said case no appeal was filed against the said finding of <ORG> upholding the constitutional validity of Section of the <ORG> However since the said issue was raised before this <ORG> during the course of arguments in the said case this <ORG> on a conjoint reading of the said provision with the object and purpose of the <ORG> held that there is no vagueness in the provision and the same also does not suffer from the vice of class legislation But we find that no cross appeal was filed by any of the respondents against the order of <ORG> upholding the constitutional validity of provisions of Section and and also that of Sections and of the <ORG> During the course of hearing Mr <NAME> the counsel appearing for one of the respondents herein tried to contend that the aforesaid provisions of Section and of the MCOCA are unconstitutional on the ground that they violate the requirement of Article of the Constitution and that they make serious inroads into the fundamental rights by treating unequals as equals and are unsustainably vague Since such issues were not specifically raised by filing an appeal and since only a passing reference is made on the said issue in the short three page affidavit filed by the respondent No it is not necessary for us to examine the said issue as it was sought to be raised more specifically in the argument stage only Even otherwise when the said definitions as existing in Section and of the MCOCA are read and understood with the object and purpose of the Act which is to make special provisions for prevention and control of organised crime it is clear that they are worded to subserve and achieve the said object and purpose of the Act There is no vagueness as the definitions defined with clarity what it meant by continuing unlawful activity organised crime and also organised crime syndicate As the provisions treat all those covered by it in a like manner and does not suffer from the vice of class legislation they cannot be said to be violative of Article of the Constitution Thus in the said case there was no specific challenge to the constitutional validity of Section of the MCOCA Moreover even in its observations this <ORG> had not gone into the question of constitutional validity of the said provision so far as it relates to insurgency on the ground of lack of legislative competence We may also refer to the findings of this Court in a situation of this nature where once the constitutional validity of a provision has been upheld and the same is again challenged on a ground which is altogether different from the earlier one SCC notwithstanding the fact that <ORG> of this Court had once upheld the constitutionality of the Public Premises Eviction of Unauthorized Occupants Act the petitioner therein had renewed his challenge on the ground that the <ORG> did not have the legislative competence to legislate on the subject of the said legislation On the facts before it this Court held that since that specific aspect had not been debated before <ORG> in the earlier case it would not be appropriate to shut out the petitioner from raising the plea by recourse to the argument that the point had been concluded in the earlier case regardless of whether the matter had been debated or not However since there was no specific challenge before this <ORG> to the constitutional validity of Section of the <ORG> and the point with reference to which the arguments were advanced in the present appeal was actually not decided in the earlier decision of this <ORG> we wish to proceed to examine the same The appellants have challenged the constitutional validity of Section of the MCOCA so far it relates to promoting insurgency on following two grounds a the Maharashtra State legislature did not have legislative competence to enact such a provision and the part of Section of the MCOCA so far as it covers case of insurgency is repugnant and has become void by enactment of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Amendment Act amending the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act The learned senior counsel appearing for the parties have advanced elaborate arguments before us on the aforesaid issues Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant in Civil Appeal No of submitted that insurgency is an offence falling within the ambit of Defence of India Entry of List I i the Union List as it threatens the unity integrity and sovereignty of India and in any event under the residuary power conferred on the <ORG> under Article read with Entry of the Union List and therefore the Maharashtra State legislature did not have legislative competence to enact the latter part of Section of the MCOCA which relates to promoting insurgency Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant in Civil Appeal No of in addition to the above noted submission submitted that Section of the <ORG> so far as it covers insurgency is repugnant and has become void by enactment of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Amendment Act amending the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act <ORG> hereinafter He submitted that insurgency and terrorism are two sides of the same coin and after the amendment the <ORG> exhaustively deals with the offence of terrorism and the meaning of the term insurgency as contained in Section of the <ORG> is very well included in the definition of terrorist act as contained in Section of the <ORG> He further submitted that due to the said anomaly an act would constitute an offence under Section of the <ORG> as also under Section of the <ORG> and that while <ORG> lays down a different procedure and envisages a different competent court to try that offence the <ORG> provides for a different procedure and different court for the trial of the same offence Thus according to him in the present case after the amendment to the <ORG> there is an implied repeal of the MCOCA so far as it covers insurgency As against this Mr <NAME> and Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing for the respondent State of Maharashtra submitted that the <ORG> deals with the activities of the organized gangs and the criminal syndicate and that no other law including the <ORG> deals with the said subject They further submitted that the aim objective and the area of operation of the <ORG> and the <ORG> are entirely different and that there is no overlapping in the working of the two Acts Hence the target of the <ORG> is the organised syndicate gangs whereas the <ORG> targets any person who indulges in terrorist activity be it an individual or a group They further submitted that at the first blush they may appear to be similar but a closer scrutiny would dispel any such notion and would show a vast area of dissimilarity between the two They further submitted that the law is settled on the point that a given act can constitute more than one offence under two or more statutes but merely because an act also becomes an offence under a subsequent statute does not automatically result in repugnancy or implied repeal of the offence defined in the earlier statue Mr <NAME> learned ASG appearing for <ORG> respondent No herein and Mr <NAME> learned ASG appearing for the <ORG> supported the contentions made by Mr <NAME> and Mr <NAME> In addition they submitted that the <ORG> creates and defines a new offence and even if it be assumed that the part of the <ORG> containing the term promoting insurgency incidentally trenches upon a field under the <ORG> list then the same cannot be held to be ultra vires applying the doctrine of pith and substance as in essence the <ORG> deals with the subject on which the State legislature has power to legislate under the Constitution Before we proceed further to deal with and answer the issues that have been raised for our consideration we wish to make note of a minor development which took place during the pendency of the present appeal Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel has in detail taken us through the provisions of the amendment At the time of hearing the counsel appearing for both the parties have fairly agreed that the amendment did not bring about any such change which would affect the decision of this <ORG> on the issues raised and urged The legislature of a State derives its legislative power from the provisions of Article of the Constitution of India Article confers on a State legislature the exclusive power to enact laws for the whole or any part of the territory of the State on any of the matters enumerated in List II in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution So far as the question of legislative competence of the Maharashtra <ORG> legislature to enact a law like MCOCA is concerned <ORG> in the impugned judgment has held that MCOCA in pith and substance falls in Entry No of List III which refers to the criminal law Though <ORG> has noted the fact that the <ORG> of Maharashtra could have relied upon Entry of List II i the <ORG> List which refers to public order to contend that the term promoting insurgency is relatable to that entry <ORG> refrained itself from analyzing the said aspect because the respondent <ORG> had before <ORG> taken a stand that promoting insurgency would be covered by Entry of List III i the Concurrent List This Court in <NAME> supra has already held that the subject matter of the <ORG> is maintaining public order and prevention by police of commission of serious offences affecting public order and thus would be within the purview of and be relatable to Entries and of List II as also to Entries and of List III of Schedule VII to the Constitution of India The question that needs to be determined in the present case is whether the said finding in <NAME> supra can be extended to the term promoting insurgency and also whether the term promoting insurgency would be within the purview and relatable to Entry of List II organised crime means any continuing unlawful activity by an individual singly or jointly either as a member of an organised crime syndicate or on behalf of such syndicate by use of violence or threat of violence or intimidation or coercion or other unlawful means with the objective of gaining pecuniary benefits or gaining undue economic or other advantage for himself or any other person or promoting insurgency Public order but not including the use of any naval military or air force or any other armed force of the <ORG> or of any other force subject to the control of the <ORG> or of any contingent or unit thereof in aid of the civil power This Court in para quoted a passage from Stephen Criminal Law of England wherein he observed as follows Unlawful assemblies riots insurrections rebellions levying of war are offences which run into each other and are not capable of being marked off by perfectly defined boundaries All of them have in common one feature namely that the normal tranquility of a civilized society is in each of the cases mentioned disturbed either by actual force or at least by the show and threat of it This Court further observed that though all these offences involve disturbances of public tranquility and are in theory offences against public order the difference between them is only one of degree The Constitution thus requires a line perhaps only a rough line to be drawn between the fields of public order or tranquility and those serious and aggravated forms of public disorder which are calculated to endanger the security of the <ORG> It will thus appear that just as public order in the rulings of this <ORG> earlier cited was said to comprehend disorders of less gravity than those affecting security of <ORG> law and order also comprehends disorders of less gravity than those affecting public order One has to imagine three concentric circles Law and order represents the largest circle within which is the next circle representing public order and the smallest circle represents security of <ORG> It is then easy to see that an act may affect law and order but not public order just as an act may affect public order but not security of the <ORG> The acts become more and more grave as we journey from the periphery of the largest circle towards the centre In this journey we travel first though public tranquility then through public order and lastly to the security of the <ORG> This Court further held that in the judgment of this Court the expression in the interest of public order as mentioned in the Constitution of India encompasses not only those acts which disturb the security of the <ORG> or acts within ordre publique as described but also certain acts which disturb public tranquility or are breaches of the peace It has been seen that the propositions laid down in the above noted cases have been time and again followed in subsequent judgments of this Court and still govern the field Maintenance of public order within a province is primarily the concern of that province and subject to certain exceptions which involve the use of His Majesty forces in aid of civil power <ORG> is given plenary authority to legislate on all matters which relate to or are necessary for maintenance of public order It is a well established rule of interpretation that the entries in the List being fields of legislation must receive liberal construction inspired by a broad and generous spirit and not a narrow or pedantic approach Each general word should extend to all ancillary and subsidiary matters which can fairly and reasonably be comprehended within it One of the proven methods of examining the legislative competence of a legislature with regard to an enactment is by the application of the doctrine of pith and substance This doctrine is applied when the legislative competence of the legislature with regard to a particular enactment is challenged with reference to the entries in various lists If there is a challenge to the legislative competence the courts will try to ascertain the pith and substance of such enactment on a scrutiny of the Act in question In this process it is necessary for the courts to go into and examine the true character of the enactment its object its scope and effect to find out whether the enactment in question is genuinely referable to a field of the legislation allotted to the respective legislature under the constitutional scheme Where a challenge is made to the constitutional validity of a particular State Act with reference to a subject mentioned in any entry in List I the <ORG> has to look to the substance of the State Act and on such analysis and examination if it is found that in the pith and substance it falls under an entry in the State List but there is only an incidental encroachment on any of the matters enumerated in the Union List the State Act would not become invalid merely because there is incidental encroachment on any of the matters in the Union List But then it must be remembered that we are construing a federal Constitution The scheme of distribution has varied with different Constitutions but even when the Constitution enumerates elaborately the topics on which the <ORG> and the States could legislate some overlapping of the fields of legislation is inevitable The British North America Act which established a federal Constitution for Canada enumerated in Sections and the topics on which the Dominion and the Provinces could respectively legislate Notwithstanding that the lists were framed so as to be fairly full and comprehensive it was not long before it was found that the topics enumerated in the two sections overlapped and <ORG> had time and again to pass on the constitutionality of laws made by the Dominion and <ORG> That is to say if a statute is found in substance to relate to a topic within the competence of the legislature it should be held to be intra vires even though it might incidentally trench on topics not within its legislative competence The extent of the encroachment on matters beyond its competence may be an element in determining whether the legislation is colourable that is whether in the guise of making a law on a matter within it competence the legislature is in truth making a law on a subject beyond its competence But where that is not the position then the fact of encroachment does not affect the vires of the law even as regards the area of encroachment This doctrine of pith and substance is applied when the legislative competence of a legislature with regard to a particular enactment is challenged with reference to the entries in the various lists i a law dealing with the subject in one list is also touching on a subject in another list On a scrutiny of the Act in question if found that the legislation is in substance one on a matter assigned to the legislature enacting that statute then that Act as a whole must be held to be valid notwithstanding any incidental trenching upon matters beyond its competence i on a matter included in the list belonging to the other legislature It is common ground that <ORG> does not have power to legislate upon any of the matters enumerated in the Union List However if it could be shown that the core area and the subject matter of the legislation is covered by an entry in the State List then any incidental encroachment upon an entry in the Union List would not be enough so as to render the State law invalid and such an incidental encroachment will not make the legislation ultra vires the Constitution It is likely to happen from time to time that enactment though purporting to deal with a subject in one list touches also on a subject in another list and prima facie looks as if one legislature is impinging on the legislative field of another legislature This may result in a large number of statutes being declared unconstitutional because the legislature enacting law may appear to have legislated in a field reserved for the other legislature To examine whether a legislation has impinged on the field of other legislatures in fact or in substance or is incidental keeping in view the true nature of the enactment the courts have evolved the doctrine of pith and substance for the purpose of determining whether it is legislation with respect to matters in one list or the other Where the question for determination is whether a particular law relates to a particular subject mentioned in one list or the other the courts look into the substance of the enactment This principle came to be established by <ORG> when it determined appeals from Canada or Australia involving the question of legislative competence of the federation or the States in those countries This doctrine came to be established in India and derives its genesis from the approach adopted by the courts including <ORG> in dealing with controversies arising in other federations In the last mentioned case it was held Where a law passed by <ORG> while being substantially within the scope of the entries in the State List entrenches upon any of the entries in the Central List the constitutionality of the law may be upheld by invoking the doctrine of pith and substance if on an analysis of the provisions of the Act it appears that by and large the law falls within the four corners of the State List and entrenchment if any is purely incidental or inconsequential Now that we have examined under what circumstances a State Law can be said to be encroaching upon the law making powers of <ORG> we may proceed to evaluate the current issue on merits Let us once again examine the provision at the core of this matter organized crime means any continuing unlawful activity by an individual singly or jointly either as a member of an organized crime syndicate or on behalf of such syndicate by use of violence or threat of violence or intimidation or coercion or other unlawful means with the objective of gaining pecuniary benefits or gaining undue economic or other advantage for himself or any person or promoting insurgency After examining this provision at length we have come to the conclusion that the definition of organized crime contained in Section of the <ORG> makes it clear that the phrase promoting insurgency is used to denote a possible driving force for organized crime We may also examine the Statement of Objects Reasons to support the conclusion arrived at by us Organised crime has been for quite some years now come up as a very serious threat to our society It knows no national boundaries and is fueled by illegal wealth generated by contract killing extortion smuggling in contrabands illegal trade in narcotics kidnappings for ransom collection of protection money and money laundering etc The illegal wealth and black money generated by the organised crime being very huge it has had serious adverse effect on our economy It was seen that the organised criminal syndicates made a common cause with terrorist gangs and foster narco terrorism which extend beyond the national boundaries There was reason to believe that organised criminal gangs have been operating in the <ORG> and thus there was immediate need to curb their activities Government has therefore decided to enact a special law with stringent and deterrent provisions including in certain circumstances power to intercept wire electronic or oral communication to control the menace of organized crime We find no merit in the contention that the <ORG> in any way deals with punishing insurgency directly From the ratio of the judgments on the point of public order referred to by us earlier it is clear that anything that affects public peace or tranquility within the <ORG> or the Province would also affect public order and the <ORG> Legislature is empowered to enact laws aimed at containing or preventing acts which tend to or actually affect public order This brings us to the second ground of challenge i the part of Section of the MCOCA so far as it covers case of insurgency is repugnant and has become void by the enactment of Unlawful Activities Prevention Amendment Act amending the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act The Bombay High Court in para of the impugned judgment has held that though promoting insurgency is one of the facets of terrorism the offence of terrorism as defined under the UAPA as amended by the Act is not identical to the offences under the MCOCA and the term terrorism and insurgency are not synonymous As per <ORG> both the enactments can stand together as there is no conflict between the two Chapter I of Part XI of the Constitution deals with the subject of distribution of legislative powers of the <ORG> and the legislature of the States Article of the Constitution provides that the <ORG> may make laws for the whole or any part of the territory of India and the legislature of a State may make laws for the whole or any part of the State Subject matter of laws made by <ORG> and by the legislature of States Notwithstanding anything in clauses and <ORG> has exclusive power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I in the Seventh Schedule in this <ORG> referred to as the Union List Notwithstanding anything in clause <ORG> and subject to clause the legislature of any State also have power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List III in the Seventh Schedule in this <ORG> referred to as the Concurrent List Subject to clauses and the legislature of any State has exclusive power to make laws for such State or any part thereof with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List II in the Seventh Schedule in this <ORG> referred to as the State List Parliament has power to make laws with respect to any matter for any part of the territory of India not included in a State notwithstanding that such matter is a matter enumerated in the State List Article of the Constitution which contains the mechanism for resolution of conflict between the Central and the <ORG> legislations enacted with respect to any matter enumerated in List III of the Seventh Schedule reads as under Inconsistency between laws made by <ORG> and laws made by the legislatures of States If any provision of a law made by the legislature of a State is repugnant to any provision of a law made by <ORG> which <ORG> is competent to enact or to any provision of an existing law with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List then subject to the provisions of Clause the law made by <ORG> whether passed before or after the law made by the legislature of such State or as the case may be the existing law shall prevail and the law made by the legislature of the State shall to the extent of the repugnancy be void Where a law made by the legislature of a State with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List contains any provision repugnant to the provisions of an earlier law made by <ORG> or an existing law with respect to that matter then the law so made by the legislature of such State shall if it has been reserved for the consideration of the President and has received his assent prevail in that State Provided that nothing in this clause shall prevent <ORG> from enacting at any time any law with respect to the same matter including a law adding to amending varying or repealing the law so made by the legislature of the State At para this Court held that repugnancy may result from the following circumstances Where the provisions of a Central Act and a State Act in the Concurrent List are fully inconsistent and are absolutely irreconcilable the Central Act will prevail and the State Act will become void in view of the repugnancy Where however a law passed by the <ORG> comes into collision with a law passed by <ORG> on an Entry in the Concurrent List the <ORG> Act shall prevail to the extent of the repugnancy and the provisions of the Central Act would become void provided the <ORG> Act has been passed in accordance with clause of Article Where a law passed by <ORG> while being substantially within the scope of the entries in the State List entrenches upon any of the Entries in the Central List the constitutionality of the law may be upheld by invoking the doctrine of pith and substance if on an analysis of the provisions of the Act it appears that by and large the law falls within the four corners of the State List and entrenchment if any is purely incidental or inconsequential Where however a law made by <ORG> on a subject covered by the Concurrent List is inconsistent with and repugnant to a previous law made by <ORG> then such a law can be protected by obtaining the assent of the President under Article of the Constitution The result of obtaining the assent of the President would be that so far as the <ORG> Act is concerned it will prevail in the <ORG> and overrule the provisions of the Central Act in their applicability to the <ORG> only Such a state of affairs will exist only until <ORG> may at any time make a law adding to or amending varying or repealing the law made by <ORG> under the proviso to Article That there is a clear and direct inconsistency between the Central Act and the State Act That the inconsistency between the provisions of the two Acts is of such nature as to bring the two Acts into direct collision with each other and a situation is reached where it is impossible to obey the one without disobeying the other That in order to decide the question of repugnancy it must be shown that the two enactments contain inconsistent and irreconcilable provisions so that they cannot stand together or operate in the same field That there can be no repeal by implication unless the inconsistency appears on the face of the two statutes That where the two statutes occupy a particular field but there is room or possibility of both the statutes operating in the same field without coming into collision with each other no repugnancy results That where there is no inconsistency but a statute occupying the same field seeks to create distinct and separate offences no question of repugnancy arises and both the statutes continue to operate in the same field <ORG> has exclusive power to legislate with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I notwithstanding anything contained in clauses and of Article The non obstante clause under Article indicates the predominance or supremacy of the law made by <ORG> in the event of an overlap of the law made by <ORG> with respect to a matter enumerated in List I and a law made by <ORG> with respect to a matter enumerated in List II of the Seventh Schedule There is no doubt that both <ORG> and <ORG> are supreme in their respective assigned fields It is the duty of the court to interpret the legislations made by <ORG> and <ORG> in such a manner as to avoid any conflict However if the conflict is unavoidable and the two enactments are irreconcilable then by the force of the non obstante clause in clause of Article the parliamentary legislation would prevail notwithstanding the exclusive power of <ORG> to make a law with respect to a matter enumerated in the State List Here again the courts are charged with the duty of interpreting the enactments of <ORG> and <ORG> in such manner as to avoid a conflict If the conflict becomes unavoidable then Article indicates the manner of resolution of such a conflict Thereafter this <ORG> in para held that the question of repugnancy between the parliamentary legislation and the <ORG> legislation could arise in following two ways First where the legislations though enacted with respect to matters in their allotted sphere overlap and conflict Second where the two legislations are with respect to matters in the Concurrent List and there is a conflict In both the situations parliamentary legislation will predominate in the first by virtue of the non obstante clause in Article in the second by reason of Article Clause of Article deals with a situation where the <ORG> legislation having been reserved and having obtained President assent prevails in that <ORG> this again is subject to the proviso that <ORG> can again bring a legislation to override even such <ORG> legislation According to its Preamble the said Act was enacted to make specific provisions for prevention and control of and for coping with criminal activity by organised crime syndicate or gang and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto The <ORG>ment of Objects and Reasons of the <ORG> inter alia states that organized crime has for quite some years now come up as a very serious threat to our society and there is reason to believe that organized criminal gangs are operating in the <ORG> and thus there is immediate need to curb their activities The <ORG>ment of Objects and Reasons in relevant part reads as under Organised crime has for quite some years now come up as a very serious threat to our society It knows no national boundaries and is fuelled by illegal wealth generated by contract killings extortion smuggling in contrabands illegal trade in narcotics kidnappings for ransom collection of protection money and money laundering etc The illegal wealth and black money generated by the organised crime is very huge and has serious adverse effect on our economy It is seen that the organised criminal syndicates make a common cause with terrorist gangs and foster narco terrorism which extend beyond the national boundaries There is reason to believe that organised criminal gangs are operating in the <ORG> and thus there is immediate need to curb their activities It is also noticed that the organised criminals make extensive use of wire and oral communications in their criminal activities The interception of such communications to obtain evidence of the commission of crimes or to prevent their commission is an indispensable aid to law enforcement and the administration of justice Government has therefore decided to enact a special law with stringent and deterrent provisions including in certain circumstances power to intercept wire electronic or oral communication to control the menace of the organised crime Clause of sub section of Section of the <ORG> defines the expression continuing unlawful activity to mean an activity prohibited by law for the time being in force which is a cognizable offence punishable with imprisonment of three years or more undertaken either singly or jointly as a member of an organised crime syndicate or on behalf of such syndicate in respect of which more than one charge sheets have been filed before a competent court within the preceding period of ten years and that court has taken cognizance of such offence Clause extracted earlier hereinabefore defines the expression organised crime to mean any continuing unlawful activity by an individual singly or jointly either as a member of an organised crime syndicate or on behalf of such syndicate by use of violence or threat of violence or intimidation or coercion or other unlawful means with the objective of gaining pecuniary benefits or gaining undue economic or other advantage for himself or any other person or promoting insurgency Clause defines organised crime syndicate to mean a group of two or more persons who acting either singly or collectively as a syndicate or gang indulge in activities of organised crime The Preamble of the UAPA was also amended to state that the said Act is enacted to provide for the more effective prevention of certain unlawful activities of individuals and associations and dealing with terrorist activities and for matters connected therewith It also makes reference to the order issued by <ORG> in exercise of power under Section of <ORG> Security Council Act which is known as the Prevention Suppression of Terrorism Implementation of Security Council Resolutions Order Whereas <ORG> of <ORG> in its th meeting adopted Resolution on th September under Chapter VII of the Charter of <ORG> requiring all the States to take measures to combat international terrorism And whereas Resolutions and of <ORG> of <ORG> require the <ORG> to take action against certain terrorists and terrorist organisations to freeze the assets and other economic resources to prevent the entry into or the transit through their territory and prevent the direct or indirect supply sale or transfer of arms and ammunitions to the individuals or entities listed in the Schedule And whereas the Central Government in exercise of the powers conferred by section of the United Nations Security Council Act has made the Prevention and Suppression of Terrorism Implementation of Security Council Resolutions Order And whereas it is considered necessary to give effect to the said Resolutions and the Order and to make special provisions for the prevention of and for coping with terrorist activities and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto terrorist act has the meaning assigned to it in section and the expression terrorism and terrorist should be construed accordingly Whoever with intent to threaten the unity integrity security or sovereignty of India or to strike terror in the people or any section of the people in India or in any foreign country does any act by using bombs dynamite or other explosive substances or inflammable substances or firearms or other lethal weapons or poisons or noxious gases or other chemicals or by any other substances whether biological or otherwise of a hazardous nature in such a manner as to cause or likely to cause death of or injuries to any person or persons or loss of or damage to or destruction of property or disruption of any supplies or services essential to the life of the community in India or in any foreign country or causes damage or destruction of any property or equipment used or intended to be used for the defence of India or in connection with any other purposes of <ORG> <ORG> or any of their agencies or detains any person and threatens to kill or injure such person in order to compel the Government in India or the Government of a foreign country or any other person to do or abstain from doing any act commits a terrorist act Whoever does any act with intent to threaten or likely to threaten the unity integrity security or sovereignty of India or with intent to strike terror or likely to strike terror in the people or any section of the people in India or in any foreign country a by using bombs dynamite or other explosive substances or inflammable substances or firearms or other lethal weapons or poisons or noxious gases or other chemicals or by any other substances whether biological radioactive nuclear or otherwise of a hazardous nature or by any other means of whatever nature to cause or likely to cause i death of or injuries to any person or persons or ii loss of or damage to or destruction of property or iii disruption of any supplies or services essential to the life of the community in India or in any foreign country or iv damage or destruction of any property in India or in a foreign country used or intended to be used for the defence of India or in connection with any other purposes of the Government of India <ORG> or any of their agencies or overawes by means of criminal force or the show of criminal force or attempts to do so or causes death of any public functionary or attempts to cause death of any public functionary or detains kidnaps or abducts any person and threatens to kill or injure such person or does any other act in order to compel <ORG> <ORG> or the Government of a foreign country or any other person to do or abstain from doing any act commits a terrorist act Sub Clauses and of sub Section of Section of the UAPA which define the term terrorist gang and terrorist organisation respectively read as under terrorist gang means any association other than terrorist organisation whether systematic or otherwise which is concerned with or involved in terrorist act terrorist organisation means an organisation listed in the Schedule or an organisation operating under the same name as an organisation so listed The following are the Terrorist Organisations which are mentioned in the First Schedule of the <ORG> The exhaustive list of terrorist organizations in the First Schedule to the <ORG> has been included in order to show the type and nature of the organizations contemplated under that Act A careful look of the same would indicate that all the organizations mentioned therein have as their aims and objects undermining and prejudicially affecting the integrity and sovereignty of India which certainly stand on a different footing when compared to the activities carried out by the forces like the appellant Section of the UAPA which defines the term unlawful activity reads as under unlawful activity in relation to an individual or association means any action taken by such individual or association whether by committing an act or by words either spoken or written or by signs or by visible representation or otherwise i which is intended or supports any claim to bring about on any ground whatsoever the cession of a part of the territory of India or the secession of a part of the territory of India from the Union or which incites any individual or group of individuals to bring about such cession or secession or ii which disclaims questions disrupts or is intended to disrupt the sovereignty and territorial integrity of India or iii which causes or is intended to cause disaffection against India Before we proceed to analyse the provisions of the two statutes in order to ascertain whether they are repugnant or not we may note that it is well settled that no provision or word in a statute is to be read in isolation In fact the statute has to be read as a whole and in its entirety Interpretation must depend on the text and the context One may well say if the text is the texture context is what gives the colour That interpretation is best which makes the textual interpretation match the contextual With this knowledge the statute must be read first as a whole and then section by section clause by clause phrase by phrase and word by word If a statute is looked at in the context of its enactment with the glasses of the statute maker provided by such context its scheme the sections clauses phrases and words may take colour and appear different than when the statute is looked at without the glasses provided by the context With these glasses we must look at the Act as a whole and discover what each section each clause each phrase and each word is meant and designed to say as to fit into the scheme of the entire Act No part of a statute and no word of a statute can be construed in isolation Statutes have to be construed so that every word has a place and everything is in its place The aim of the <ORG> on the other hand is to deal with terrorist and certain unlawful activities which are committed with the intent to threaten the unity integrity security
