In this case the plaintiff as purchaser of the equity of redemption sued to redeem and recover possession of certain thikans originally mortgaged with possession by the plaintiff vendors to the ancestors of defendants who on th April had by Exhibit transferred their rights to defendants for Rs Exhibit the registered instrument whereby defendants transferred their rights to defendants recited that the property in question was held in mortgage from one <NAME> under the mortgage bond of Exhibit and added that <NAME> direct heirs had received more moneys from the original mortgagee and passed separate documents on stamped paper and that if accounts were taken of the whole the amount would be very large but that Ra had been accepted by the original mortgagees from defendants and that in consideration of that sum all the mortgaged rights were accordingly sold to defendants and possession was given thereunder to tine mortgagees profits being taken by them in lieu of interest They were not handed over by the original mortgagees to the defendants either at date of Exhibit or at any time before suit nor were they specifically described in the written statements put in for the defence It recites the fact that the mortgage of for Rs All these three documents purporting to be more than thirty years old the question arose whether they were admissible as produced from proper custody Now the section itself admits a presumption of the genuineness of documents purporting to be thirty years old if produced from custody proved to have had a legitimate origin or an origin the legitimacy of which the circumstances of the case render probable vide explanation to Section and the section read with the explanation attached thereto seems be insist only on a satisfactory account of the origin of the custody and not on the history of its continuance the question of admissibility must be exclusively decided by the Judge however complicated the circumstances may be and though it may be necessary to weigh the conflicting testimony of numerous witnesses in order to arrive at a just conclusion Whether it were credible or not that the documents in question were originally left in the custody of the mortgagee in whose favour they were executed appears to me to be as much a question of fact as the question whether they were executed by the alleged obligors or not and even if it were a question of law it would I think be impossible to hold that the origin of the mortgagees custody was not both legitimate and probable The further question whether the alleged subsequent history of those documents was sufficient to throw suspicion on their authenticity and rebut any presumption arising under Section was I think undoubtedly one of fact with which it is impossible to interfere on second appeal regard being had to the decision of <ORG> in <NAME> <NAME> Cal In these circumstances I think there is no alternative but to accept the finding of the lower <ORG> that these Exhibits to were produced from custody which is proper within the meaning of Section of the Evidence Act and that they were duly executed by the persons by whom they purport to have been executed The objection that Exhibit bears only the mark of the alleged obligor appears to have no weight in face of the concluding words of the section for it is not contended that the document does not purport to have been executed by the person whose mark it purports to bear and this in the case of a document falling under Section is sufficient although had it been necessary to prove execution it would have been necessary to prove the identity of the executing party The other two documents Exhibits and being respectively dated February and March both come within the operation of Act XVI of and it is urged are both compulsorily registrable under Section thereof as though the consideration appearing on the face of the documents is in each case under Rs But in the present instance there is no plea that the plaintiff is not bound by the first mortgage He sues to redeem it and has never disputed liability to pay it off They do not therefore impose or create or in any way affect the undisputed liability for the mortgage of which arises aliunde and are a mere declaration of the fact of a liability which the plaintiff has throughout made no attempt to dispute In the case of <NAME> <NAME> cited above the liability of the <NAME> for their father mortgage was unquestioned but their father agreement to pay off a subsequent money bond for Rs A reference to that last cited case shows that the reason for holding such subsequent document inadmissible was that it had the effect of limiting the interest of the mortgagor to the extent of Rs But no such point has been taken and the time has long passed at which it might have been taken The next point taken for appellant is that the provisions of Section of the Registration Act apply to these documents Exhibits and viz that every registered document of the kind mentioned in Clauses a and of Section and therefore Exhibit which falls within that description shall take effect as regards the property comprised therein against every unregistered document relating to the same property and therefore as against such documents as Exhibits and as the new point is purely a question of law arising on the findings of the <ORG> below and not affected by any facts outside these findings The appellant contends that he is a purchaser bona fide without notice and on its being objected that Exhibit is a registered document containing a recital of incumbrances it is urged for appellant that registration is at most constructive notice and that the doctrine of constructive notice cannot be so extended as to cover unregistered documents under which the holders of registered documents derive title and <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> In that case the plaintiffs were out of possession and had purchased under a registered deed from a vendor whose title deed was unregistered and it was held that plaintiff and his grantors were mere strangers be the land unless they could rely on the unregistered conveyance which could take no effect upon the property when brought into competition with the registered conveyance to the defendant And when it was argued that the defendant had notice of the unregistered document through the registered document the <ORG> held that it would be pushing the doctrine of constructive notice beyond all bounds to held that it is notice of the unregistered documents under which the holders derived their title as authority for the position that constructive notice of a deed is constructive notice of its contents provided the deed is a deed relating to the title and forming part of the chain of title appears to exonerate the purchaser or lessee from the duty of enquiry as to a document of which he has contructive notice only in cases where he might get a complete chain of title without any notice of that document where he would be justified in resting assured that it could not affect him But <NAME> <NAME> was careful to say that line of cases has no bearing at all on a case where you know the deed does affect the land which is a case in which the <ORG> held that the circumstances wore not sufficient to fix the plaintiff with constructive notice or to put him upon enquiry wherein the principle appropriate rested upon the equity that where one man allows another to hold himself out as the owner of an estate and a third person purchases it for value from the apparent owner in the belief that he is the real owner the man who so allows the other to hold himself out shall not be permitted to recover upon his secret title unless he can show direct notice constructive notice or circumstances putting the purchaser on an enquiry It is clear that such a case can have no bearing in the present instance In the case cited there was no actual notice and the vendors had been placed in such a position as to be the apparent owners and it was with reference to those circumstances that the Calcutta High <ORG> held that unless there is wilful or fraudulent turning away from enquiry the doctrine of constructive notice would not apply That relates to a charge without notice on a chose in action and it appears that except so far as the actual notice was given subsequent incumbrancers could have no knowledge whatever of the existence of any prior charge It is clear that the principles of that case apply only to the duty of enquiry arising in cases where apart from constructive notice there is nothing to put the purchaser on enquiry In the present instance the appellant has put his case as if there were nothing but the constructive notice furnished by the registered deed of assignment to the defendants Exhibit and they rely therefore on the inadequacy of such notice as an all sufficient protection For this purpose they lay stress on the cases already cited of <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> And it has been held in a long series of cases in this <ORG> that possession is notice sea especially <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> it may be noted is not really opposed to this principle for the ratio decidendi there proceeded upon the fact that the plaintiff the prior unregistered mortgagee was not in actual possession and that his mortgagor was and that person subsequently dealing with the property had no reason to suppose that he was in possession otherwise than as owner And therefore the plaintiff had every reason to suppose that there was an incumbrance on the property and does not profess to have supposed that there was not Possession according to the <ORG> ruling in <NAME> <NAME> Bom has been deemed by Hindu and Mahomedan laws as interpreted in this Presidency to amount to notice of such title as the person in possession may have and any other person who bakes a mortgage or other charge upon or purchases immoveable property without ascertaining the nature of the claim of him in possession does so at his own risk This principle is quite distinct from that which was adopted in the same case on the authority of American cases as to registration being in itself notice to subsequent purchasers and mortgagees and appears from note on page of the <ORG> judgment so be based on the remark of <NAME> in <NAME> <NAME> Here vide that possession is prima facie evidence of a seisin in fee In the passage preceding that remark the Vice Chancellor stated as a proposition which he did not dispute that if a person purchases an estate which he knows to be in the occupation of another than the vendor he is bound by all the equities which the person in such occupation may have in the land where it was said pages assuming that the defendant was in possession when the mortgage deed was executed be plaintiff or that plaintiff had otherwise notice of defendant purchase it is dear that the latter could derive no advantage from the registration of his mortgage In all the Bombay decisions cited above the reason for withholding preference from the subsequent registered purchase was based not on the doctrine that registration was constructive notice for the prior alienation was in most of them unregistered but upon the long established and undisputed principle that a purchaser is always bound by all the equities of a third party in possession because possession presupposes bible and therefore is notice which ought to puts a purchaser on enquiry In all the cases relied on by appellant as to the inadequacy of constructive notice of documents mentioned in a registered deed this element of the prior purchaser being in possession was wanting and in such cases mere registration as held in Inderdawan Pershad Gobind Lal Cal It seems hardly necessary to observe that in <NAME> <NAME> Bom possession failed to give priority because it was obtained with constructive notice of a prior registered incumbrance so that the decision in no way questions the effect to be given to possession under a deed prior to that of a rival purchaser which cites with apparent approval the Bombay case of <NAME> <NAME> Bom which accepts the principle laid down in <NAME> <NAME> Cal It was contended for respondents that he had actual notice in the shape of direct information But he had full knowledge that there was some incumbrance apart from the registered assignment Exhibit to defendants He contends that at most he had constructive notice through that registered document and that it was not explicit or binding as to Exhibits and And this duty would not have been fulfilled by his assuming on the discovery of one of the liabilities attaching to the property that there were No others to support the claim of the person in possession That is to say he was not entitled merely because he may have known of the mortgage of to abstain from all further inquiry and profess that he could not be bound by any other title deed however genuine in favour of the person in possession The recent case of <NAME> <NAME> Ch seems to make this clear in the passage which says If a purchaser or mortgagee has notice that the vendor is not in possession of the property he must make inquiries of the person in possession of the tenant who is in possession and find out from him what Ms rights are and if he does not choose to do that then whatever title he acquires as purchaser or mortgagee will be subject to the title or right of the tenant in possession And it seems to me that if the Exhibits and are genuine as the lower <ORG> has found as a fact they are the plaintiff is no more exonerated in respect of those documents than he would have been if they had been the only liabilities justifying the possession of the defendants In the face of Exhibit it would be difficult if the plaintiff relied on that document as excusing him from further inquiry to say that the plaintiff had no reason because he had notice of Exhibit to make any further inquiry The lower <ORG> has found that on the rd December plaintiff purchased the equity of redemption from defendant for Rs But there is no allegation that he ever made inquiry and was refused information as to their existence And I think the plaintiff could escape liability for them only by showing that he had made inquiry and had no reason on inquiry to believe in their existence And neither <ORG> has dealt with the case at all with reference to the liability of the plaintiff as a purchaser who having notice of defendants possession had abstained from inquiry into the title The question of limitation as to Exhibits and does not appear to have been urged those documents being payable according to their tenour it would seem only when redemption was claimed so that till redemption was sought time would not begin to run in respect thereof under Article and the point does not seem to have been taken in the lower <ORG>s The only real questions in the case appear to be a whether the defendants possession was notice which bound plaintiff to inquire whether if this be so he could rely on Section of the Registration Act as giving him an absolute priority which could not be affected by the equitable doctrine of notice arising from possession in the defendants and whether if the plaintiff cannot rely on Section of the Registration Act as giving him absolute priority but was also bound by the possession of the defendants to inquire into the nature and extent of their rights he had made due inquiry and been misled or put of his guard or been refused information altogether This last question is one of fact which owing to the view the lower <ORG>s took of the case was not inquired into and decided and I would therefore send the case back to the lower <ORG> for a decision on the above question viz He brought this suit to redeem this one mortgage and recover possession on payment of Rs Defendants descendants of <NAME> replied that they had transferred their rights to defendants and that there is no mention in this defence of defendants of any claim in respect of any other mortgage or charge There is no mention of the number dates or amounts of the other bonds vaguely referred to they are expressly called money bonds and the plea raised in respect of them is not any claim to increase the redemption money payable but a plea that the sons and daughters of the original mortgagor should be made parties Nor is there any mention in the issues framed in the suit of any mortgage other than the one which the plaintiff <NAME> sued to redeem that is the mortgage of th December for Rs It not whether or not the plaintiff has a right to bring this suit What amount is due on the mortgage sought to be redeemed including cost of repairing and improving the property and the payment of dast thereon by <NAME> This decree was reversed in appeal on the finding that the plaintiff is entitled to redeem the mortgage in question and the suit was remanded for findings on the other issues and a fresh decision according to law After this remand the Subordinate Judge decided under the third issue already repeated above that Rs The th of Chaitra Vadya in Shake the th of April the cyclical name of the year being Vijaya On this day this sale deed is passed in writing to <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> Chambhars residing at Panchanadi by <NAME> residing at Kalthare taluka Dapoli at present at Ratnagiri I give in writing as follows I have this day taken from you Rs In consideration for the same sell the following property situate at the village of Kashe Panchanadi sub district Dapoli district Ratnagiri However on receiving from you now the amount above mentioned I have sold to you my right as mortgagee of this property I have sold the mortgage right of this property to you as stated above Should the owner come to you to pay the mortgage amount within the period prescribed by law you should receive the amount in accordance with terms of the deed executed by him and make over the property to him I have duly executed this sale deed of my own free will and pleasure It will be seen that there is mention of further sums having been borrowed on the security of the same property bat the further documents as to which no particulars are given as to number date or amount are not called mortgage bonds but are called documents on stamped papers Mention is made of an account being made up which by including expenses for repairs since amounted to a very large sum There is no express statement that the debts subsequently incurred were assigned to the persons in whose favour Exhibit was passed and the words I have sold to you my right as mortgagee of this property read with the express mention of the mortgage of and the passage later on Should the owner come to you to pay the mortgage amount within the period prescribed by law you should receive the amount in accordance with the terms of the deed executed by him and make over the property to him are sufficiently general to leave room for contention that this was a sale of the mortgage rights under the mortgage deed Exhibit of and nothing more It was contended for the appellant <NAME> original plaintiff that this was clearly what defendants understood as shown by their written statement and defence to this Suit already described above as well as by the fact that none of these further bonds called money bonds by defendants were made over by defendant to defendants The Subordinate Judge without discussing the custody from which these three unregistered documents had come into <ORG> considered them proved by the evidence of witness and because defendant who has no interest in the plaint property admits all these mortgages in his examination Exhibit The Assistant Judge who decided the appeal does not mention the evidence of witness Exhibit but held these three bonds Exhibits to be genuine and to be in the identical bonds mentioned in Exhibit without number dates or amounts His reasons for coming to this conclusion as far as can be gathered from his judgment recorded are first that defendants are illiterate men of the lowest caste while defendants are educated Brahmins who probably took advantage of the ignorance of defendants and therefore retained Exhibits for some purpose of their own instead of handing them over to defendants as they must have known perfectly well that they should have done secondly because Exhibit makes mention of other stamped documents passed by direct heirs of the original mortgagor and the evidence that there were any improvements which could have raised the purchase value of the mortgage rights from Rs It has been contended for the appellant <NAME> original plaintiff that the lower appellate Court finding of fact that Exhibits are genuine documents is vitiated by the method by which this conclusion is arrived at beause the Assistant Judge seems to have dispensed with formal evidence as to their execution by treating them as ancient documents coming from proper custody and by drawing the presumption permissible under Section of the Evidence Act I of as to handwriting execution and attestation I agree therefore with the view of the lower <ORG> that if Exhibits had been produced in this particular case from the custody of defendants they would have come from proper custody Nevertheless I read the judgment of the lower <ORG> as recognising this and as basing the finding of fact that these unregistered Exhibits are genuine and are the identical documents on stamped papers referred to in Exhibit and were assigned by defendant to defendants upon the evidence actually recorded in the suit such as it is There remains the question whether it was rightly decided that the appellant <NAME> is bound to pay the charges created by Exhibits in addition to the mortgage debt of Rs before he can recover possession of the plaint property from defendants Section of the Registration Act III of confers priority on documents required to be registered and accordingly registered since Act III of was passed over all prior unregistered documents of an antagonistic character <NAME> <NAME> Bom But in spite of the large words of the exacting part this Court has consistently limited them to the cases where the subsequent purchaser has no notice of the prior unregistered conveyance <NAME> <NAME> Bom The respondent pleader relying therefore on the equitable doctrine of notice contended that by reason of the registration of the deed of assignment Exhibit passed by defendant in April the appellant plaintiff had notice of the transactions set out in the unregistered documents Exhibits so far as they can be taken to be dealt with by Exhibit where it was said by <NAME> <NAME> the register may be notice and in most cases under the rulings of this Court doubtless is of the registered documents which it contains but it would be pushing the doctrine of constructive notice beyond all bounds to hold that it is notice of the unregistered documents under which the holders of registered documents derive their title and the respondents being in possession as assignees of the usufructuary mortgage of when appellant bought the equity of redemption from defendant No in the point has been raised without however any argument being specially directed to it at the hearing whether such possession was notice to appellant of the subsequent charges purporting to be created by the unregistered Exhibits In equity it is sufficient to charge a man with knowledge that he had that before him which if he had used due diligence would have afforded the knowledge he desires per Lord St In the case of <NAME> <NAME> there was neglect to make such inquiry At it was said by <NAME> Had he taken up another line of defence we might perhaps have given him an opportunity of showing that at the time of his purchase he did make inquiries and was informed and believed that the mortgage had been foreclosed In <NAME> <NAME> Ch where it was held that a purchaser or lessee having notice of a deed passing part of his vendor or lessor title has constructive notice of the contents of such deed it was said by <NAME> <NAME> Supposing you are buying land of a married man as in <NAME> <NAME> Hare and you are told at the same time that there is a marriage settlement but the deed does not affect the land in question you have no constructive notice of its contents because although you know there is a settlement you are told it does not affect the land at it was said by <NAME> These questions of notice and of the effect of notice are some of the most difficult questions which <ORG> has to deal with and I cannot help feeling that we must be very careful not to strain the doctrine of notice too far and to make it involve consequences of liability to persons who may be practically innocent And again at page If a man has notice that there is a deed or document and at the same time has notice that that deed or document is entirely worthless or does not affect the property with which he is going to deal he is put so completely off his guard that <ORG> does not treat him as fixed with knowledge of the document or the effect of it Under Section of the Transfer of Property Act IV of a person is said to have notice of a fact when he actually knows that fact or when but for wilful abstention from an inquiry or search which he ought to have made or gross negligence he would have known it or when information of the fact is given to or obtained by his agent under the circumstances mentioned in the Indian Contract Act Section Now in the present case though defendants and after parting with all their respective interest in the plaint land have shown a readiness to support the belated claim of defendants to hold the plaint land subject to the charges purporting to be created by Exhibits after the mortgage of it does not follow that this was the attitude adopted by defendants and all along They in fact resisted redemption until they were paid Rs the price paid to defendant and Rs There is nothing on the record to show that the plaintiff made no inquiry when he purchased the equity of redemption from defendant nor does the written statement of defendants suggest that any such inquiry would have led to an assertion by defendants in of any claim under Exhibits or to the production of those documents which were not in the custody of defendants at any time The point whether <NAME> was fixed with knowledge of the contents of Exhibits by means of the possession of defendants is a still later development and <NAME> the appellant plaintiff has not been given a proper opportunity to meet the new case thus brought forward for the defendants For the above reasons I concur entirely in the view that this appeal cannot be decided on the ground that plaintiff was at the time of his purchase fixed with the knowledge of the charges purporting to be created by Exhibits until the plaintiff has been given the opportunity to show whether at the time of his purchase from defendant he did make inquiries as to the possession of defendants and with what result so that it may be ascertained whether he was offered the same information as that given in the written defence of defendants and was misled or put off his guard as to the nature and extent of the rights of defendants
