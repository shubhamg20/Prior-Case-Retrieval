He was put on probation for a period of two years and the order of appointment specifically provided that he would be confirmed in service on the satisfactory completion of the period of probation and the passing of a departmental examination which may be prescribed during the period We are informed that he passed it while he was under suspension On the appellant was placed under suspension by an order passed on that date Along with the order a charge sheet containing as many as five charges was served on him The appellant showed cause by means of a lengthy document submitted on It appears from a letter of the Director that he thought that the appellant was obstinately refusing to furnish further explanation as to certain points raised by him in his memorandum and that he was insisting on the points being formally reduced to writing and formally served on him before he would undertake to answer them The report was duly considered by <ORG> and they came provisionally to the conclusion that the appellant should be punished with discharge from <ORG> service under Rule vi of the Civil Service A Rules The appellant did make a representation but it found no favour with the authorities They consulted <ORG> and on the recommendation received from that body they finally decided that the appellant should be discharged from <ORG> service The appellant then moved this Court under Article of the Constitution against the Director of <ORG> the Secretary in the Department of Forests and <ORG> and the State of West Bengal for a writ of mandamus commanding them to rescind the orders passed against him or to forbear from giving effect to them Aggrieved by that order the appellant preferred the present appeal The learned Judge held that the appellant had continued to be a probationer and I find no good reason to dissent from that view Admittedly he did not pass a departmental examination during the probationary period and obviously his work was not considered satisfactory It may have been wrong for <ORG> not to hold a departmental examination within the probationary period and the appellant if he was so minded might have taken appropriate steps at the appropriate time for forcing <ORG> to hold a timely examination The grievance was that he was entitled to the benefit of Article of the Constitution of India and therefore he was entitled to a proper enquiry into the charges against him and proper opportunities to show cause both against the charges and if the charges were found proved against the action proposed to her taken against him The learned Judge also pointed out that the appellant had been proceeded against under Rule of the Bengal Subordinate Services Discipline and Appeal Rules and that according to the explanation appended to that Rule the discharge of a person appointed on probation during the period of probation would not amount to removal or dismissal within the meaning of the Rule On the basis of the explanation the learned Judge held that since the appellant was only a probationer and since he had been discharged during the period of his probation he had neither been dismissed nor removed and therefore he could not complain that the protection of Article had not been made available to him The learned Judge found it unnecessary to decide whether what had taken place could be said to have been an enquiry as contemplated by Article or the relevant Service Rules because in his view the appellant having been a mere probationer was not entitled to an enquiry of that kind at all On the broad features of the case the learned Judge held that it could not fairly be said that the appellant had had no opportunity for establishing his innocence He pointed out that the authorities had proceeded on documents which had been fully dealt with by the appellant in his representations and that he had been given opportunity to show cause against both the charges and the penalty proposed to be imposed on him I should explain here that Rule provides that where it is proposed to terminate the employment of a probationer whether during or at the end of the period of probation for any specific fault on account of his unsuitability for the service he shall be apprised of the grounds of such proposal and given an opportunity to show cause against it There is no such Rule amongst the Bengal Subordinate Services Discipline and Appeal Rules and that explains why the learned Judge said even if Rule applies It appears to me that the view taken by the learned Judge of the proceedings had against the appellant is not warranted by the facts If the service of a probationer is terminated merely on the ground of his work being unsatisfactory and terminated in accordance with the terms of the employment no question of any penalty being imposed it is true arises But even a probationer can be proceeded against for misconduct and proceedings with a view to imposing a penalty can be taken against a probationer as well As I have explained elsewhere a probationer will normally servo up to the end of the probationary period and then be either confirmed if his work has been found satisfactory or discharged if the reverse has been the case but if before me probationary period is over or if although the period is over the <ORG> servant concerned is still holding the status of a probationer some misconduct if alleged against him and proceedings are started with a view to punishing him for such misconduct it can by no means be said that no more is being done than the terms of the employment are being worked out The I meaning of that provision is that if a person appointed on probation is discharged during the period of probation such discharge will not be a penalty of removal within the meaning of clause vi of Rule nor a penalty of dismissal within the meaning of clause vii of the same Rule The fact therefore that the authorities in the present case proceeded under Rule of the Bengal Subordinate Services Discipline and Appeal Rules proves rather than disproves that they were proceeding against the appellant with a view to imposing a penalty The explanation to Rule is an exception and if a case comes under the exception Rule will not apply at all and no proceedings under that Rule can be taken If it was a question of merely examining the record of the appellant with a view to taking a decision as to whether he should or should not be confirmed it could hardly be appropriate to serve him with a charge sheet Not merely was a charge sheet served but as I have already pointed out the appellant was asked to show cause why disciplinary action under Rule of the Bengal Subordinate Services Discipline and Appeal Rules should not be taken against him A charge sheet was served cause was directed to be shown against the charges then an enquiry of a kind was held at the end of the enquiry a particular penalty was tentatively decided on then the appellant was asked to show cause why that penalty should not be imposed and ultimately it was imposed The succession of these steps coupled with the fact that the authorities were on their own admission proceeding under Rule of the Bengal Subordinate Services Discipline and Appeal Rules shows conclusively that they were holding an enquiry with a view to imposing a penalty if the charges were proved There it was stated that Government bad come to the conclusion provisionally that the appellant should be punished with discharge from Government service and he was asked to show cause why he should not be punished in the manner stated Mr <NAME> who appeals for the respondents was asked by me whether he could in view of these facts contend that the appellant had been treated merely as a probationer and whether it was not a fact that the authorities had proceeded against him for alleged misconduct with a view to punishing him therefor It must therefore be held that the appellant was entitled to the protection of Article of the Constitution and that therefore was entitled to a proper opportunity at a proper enquiry to show cause against the charges framed against him The learned Judge has undoubtedly held that even if the appellant was entitled to the Constitutional protection he had in substance got it because the authorities had proceeded on nothing which he had not dealt with in his representations and because two opportunities one to show cause against the charges and another to show cause against the proposed punishment had in fact been given I pass over the appellant objection that the so called Enquiring Officer was the complainant himself but an enquiry had to be directed to be held and the appellant had to be given proper notice thereof All that happened after he had submitted the explanation was that he was asked by a telegram to appear before the Director of Fisheries in connection with a representation made by him The learned Judge has said that the appellant could not complain that he had not been given an opportunity to call witnesses because he had never asked for such an opportunity It appears to me that since no <ORG> or Enquiring Officer had ever been appointed and the appellant had merely been asked to see the Director of Fisheries which he did at least once it cannot fairly be said that an occasion had arisen when he could ask for an opportunity to call witnesses There was nothing to indicate to him that what was being held by the Director of Fisheries was anything but an interview between a superior Officer and a subordinate Officer and that it was a formal enquiry at which he would be entitled to call witnesses It is true as the learned Judge has observed that the appellant had not specifically asked for an opportunity to call any evidence but I do not think that anything ever happened which could put him in mind that he was appearing at a formal enquiry and that he was to ask for an opportunity to tender evidence if he wished to tender evidence I am therefore of opinion that since no <ORG> or Enquiring Officer was ever appointed and all that happened was that the appellant was summoned for interview with his superior Officer it cannot be said that having had an opportunity to call evidence the appellant had not claimed it and that therefore he is estopped The result as I see it is that the appellant being entitled to a proper enquiry and entitled to an opportunity to snow cause thereat in a proper manner was not granted such an opportunity In my view the proper order to make will be not merely to quash the order passed against the appellant but also to give further directions Certain charges were framed the appellant submitted his explanation and the position is that thereafter the matter did not proceed according to law and that all that happened subsequently must be quashed as having been illegal For the reasons given above this appeal is allowed the order of the learned Judge dated is set aside and the order of discharge dated passed against the appellant by the State Government is quashed We direct further that if Government be so minded they will be at liberty to continue the proceedings in accordance with law from the stage at which the appellant had furnished his explanation of the charges framed against him but no enquiry had yet been held and pass such orders as may be lawful and proper according to the result of such proceedings The appellant will have the costs of this appeal from respondent No the State of West Bengal hearing fee five gold mohurs
