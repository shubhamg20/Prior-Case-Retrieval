The relevant facts of the case are that <ORG> <ORG> had imported Video Magnetic Tapes in pancakes in terms of Advance Licence No dated under the <ORG> Scheme <ORG> Book No dated and cleared the goods free of duty under Bill of Entry No dated for the purpose of manufacture of Video Magnetic Tapes in hubs which were to be exported in discharge of export obligation under the said Scheme that in discharge of the export obligation they presented a consignment of what was declared as Video Magnetic Tapes in hubs for export under Shipping Bill No dated that these goods were detained and examined whereupon it appeared to <ORG> authorities that the consignment contained old used and junk video magnetic tapes in hubs of no commercial value and which did not appear to have been made out of the imported raw material Video Magnetic Tapes in Pancakes that <ORG> Agent of <ORG> <ORG> stated to the SIIB of <ORG> who investigated the case that they had filed the Shipping Bill at the instance of <NAME> partner of the exporting firm that <NAME> in his statements dated and under Section of the <ORG> Act admitted that the goods covered by the above Shipping Bill had been purchased by him from various suppliers of old and used hubs and tapes that <NAME> further admitted that he had sold off a part of the raw materials imported by his firm in October and had thereby earned a profit of Rs and detained the same that Shri <NAME> admitted that the said quantity of Video Magnetic Tapes in hubs had been manufactured by <ORG> Dipen Textiles at Palghar in May out of the imported Video Magnetic Tapes in Pancakes that it appeared to the Department that <ORG> <ORG> had removed the raw material from their premises to the premises of <ORG> Dipen Textiles Pvt Ltd that Central Excise officers seized the above packages each containing Video Magnetic Tapes in hubs under panchnama dated under Section of the <ORG> Act that the DGFT authorities by letter dated informed the <ORG> that the Advance Licence and the <ORG> book of <ORG> <ORG> had been cancelled that on account of the cancellation of Advance Licence and <ORG> book the <ORG> authorities considered the import of the raw material cleared free of duty under three Bills of Entry dated and to be unauthorized as the same were covered by the Negative List of import items under the relevant Exim Policy that it appeared to the <ORG> authorities that <ORG> <ORG> had deliberately misdeclared the goods covered by Shipping Bill No dated to make it appear that the said goods had been manufactured out of raw material Video Magnetic Tapes in pancakes cleared under Bill of Entry No dated that the said authorities held the view that the misdeclared goods were liable to confiscation under Section and i of the <ORG> Act read with Section of the Export Trade Control Order that <ORG> <ORG> and Shri <NAME> had rendered themselves liable to penalty under Section i of the Act that consequent upon cancellation of the Advance Licence and <ORG> book the imported Video Magnetic Tapes in pancakes which were cleared without payment of <ORG> duty became chargeable to duty to the extent of over Rs lakhs that <ORG> <ORG> and Shri <NAME> were also liable for penalty under Section of the Act that their CHA <ORG> Shipping Agency having aided and abetted the attempted fraudulent export of second hand goods by <ORG> <ORG> had rendered themselves liable to penalty under Section i of the Act and that a show cause notice was issued to <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> Dipen Textiles Pvt Ltd and Shri <NAME> proposing to i confiscate the goods covered by Shipping Bill No dated under Section of the Customs Act read with Section of the Export Trade Control Order ii confiscate the Video Magnetic Tapes on Pancakes converted into Video Magnetic Tapes in Hubs at Palghar under Section and read with Section of the Customs Act iii impose personal penalties under Sections i and a of the Act on the noticees iv recover duty of customs on the Video Magnetic Tapes on pancakes cleared under all the three Bills of Entry The <ORG> was also called upon to show cause why personal penalty should not be imposed on them under Section i of the Customs Act The Commissioner of <ORG> after considering the written submissions submitted by the noticees in reply to the show cause notice and after hearing their Counsel passed the impugned order dated We have heard both the sides The Counsel argued that where there was no prohibition for exporting the goods the goods were not liable to confiscation under Section of the Customs Act It was further submitted that as the goods which were declared as Video Magnetic Tapes in hubs were found to be so on visual examination there was no misdeclaration on the part of the appellants nor had they any intention to misdeclare the goods It was not correct on the part of the Commissioner to rely on the statements of panch witnesses as to the nature of the goods without giving the appellants an opportunity of cross examining them The Counsel added that the repeated requests made by the appellants for cross examination of the panchas were only ignored by the Commissioner The Department failed to discharge their burden of proving that the goods were old and used He concluded by submitting that there was nothing wrong with the confiscation of the goods or with the imposition of penalties on the appellants The observations contained in para of <ORG> judgment were in the nature of obiter dicta and did not provide any binding ratio We have carefully examined the submissions He also produced records showing sale of pancakes at the rate of Rs It was claimed that the statements dated and were retracted on and respectively and that the retracting letters were sent to the investigators <ORG> New Custom House Bombay under certificate of posting The impugned order says that there was nothing on record to show that the appellants had retracted the statements dated and We have also found no evidence of any retracting letter having been received by the departmental investigators It has been claimed by the appellants that this document is evidence of their retracting letter dated having been sent to the <ORG> By no stretch of imagination can a certificate of posting issued by postal authorities to the sender be considered as evidence of receipt of the postal article by the addressee Therefore in this case there is no sustainable evidence of any retraction of the statements dated and The statements have been rightly relied upon by the adjudicating authority He even went to the extent of admitting that the suppliers of the goods had told him that the goods were old and used ones It has been held by <ORG> in the case of <NAME> supra that misdeclaration of value of goods by exporter amounts to violation of prohibition deemed to have been imposed under Section of the Customs Act attracting the provisions of Section of the Act This view of <ORG> is contained in para of its judgment which reads as under Similarly under the Foreign Trade Regulation Rules which have been framed under the Foreign Trade Development and Regulation Act Rule i provides that value would have the same meaning as was assigned to it in Section of the act Thus the procedure for determination of value under Section of the act is brought in for the purposes of the Rules Rule of the Rules clearly states that the value of the goods must be stated whether the goods are liable to duty or not and such statement must be certified as being correct If an incorrect declaration of the value is made this would violate Section of the Act which forbids the export or import of goods in violation of the Rues This in turn would attract the provisions of Sections and of the Act as goods imported or exported contrary to law and give <ORG> the power to investigate the correct value of the gods in question and for that purpose utilize the method prescribed under Section The above ruling of <ORG> has been followed by this <ORG> in the case of <NAME> supra In the result it is the decision of <ORG> that should be followed in the instant case In the facts and circumstances of the case we do not find any reason to interfere with the quantum of redemption fine imposed by him under Section in lieu of confiscation We reduce it to Rs Therefore we set aside the penalty imposed on <NAME>
