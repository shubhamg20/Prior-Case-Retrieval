Section of the Act is void as the provision relating to the payment of annual contribution contained in it is a tax and not a fee and so it was beyond the legislative competence of <ORG> to enact such a provision The ingredients of both office and property of duties and personal interest are blended together in the rights of a <NAME> and the <NAME> has the right to enjoy this property or beneficial interest so long as he is entitled to hold his office It is not possible to formulate a definition of fee that can apply to all cases as there are various kinds of fees But a fee may generally be defined as a charge for a special service rendered to individuals by some governmental agency The amount of fee levied is supposed to be based on the expenses incurred by the <ORG> in rendering the service though in many cases such expenses are arbitrarily assessed The distinction between a tax and a fee lies primarily in the fact that a tax is levied as part of a common burden while a fee is a payment for a special benefit or privilege The Judgment of the Court was delivered by MUKHERJIA This appeal is directed against a judgment of <ORG> of <ORG> dated the th of December by which the learned Judges allowed petition presented by the respondent under article of the Constitution and directed a writ of prohibition to issue in his favour prohibiting the appellant from proceeding with the settlement of a scheme in connection with a Math known as the Shirur Math of which the petitioner happens to be the head or superior It may be stated at the outset that the petition was filed at a time when the Madras Hindu Religion Endowments Act Act II of was in force and the writ was prayed for against <ORG> constituted under that Act which was the predecessor in authority of the present appellant and had initiated proceedings for settlement of a scheme against the petitioner under section of the said Act In view of the Earlier Act being replaced by the new one leave was given to all the petitioners to amend their petitions and challenge the validity of the <NAME> Under section of the New Act notifications orders and acts under the Earlier Act are to be treated as notifications orders and acts issued made or done by the appropriate authority under the corresponding provisions of the New Act and in accordance with this provision the Commissioner <ORG> Madras who takes the place of the President <ORG> Board under the Earlier Act was added as a party to the proceedings Besides these eight <ORG> each one of which is presided over by a Sanvasi or Swami there exists another ancient religious institution at Udipi known as <ORG> also established by <NAME> which is supposed to contain an image of <NAME> originally made by <NAME> and miraculously obtained from a vessel wrecked at the coast of Tulava There is no <ORG> in <ORG> and its The petitioner was installed as <ORG> in the year when he was still a minor and he assumed management after coming of age some time in In however came the turn of his taking over management of the Shri Krishna <ORG> and he had had to incur debts to meet the heavy expenditure attendant on the Pariyayam ceremonies The financial position improved to some extent during the years that followed but troubles again arose in which was the year of the second Pariyayam of the <NAME> It appears that in pursuance of the direction of the <ORG> one <NAME> was appointed an agent and a Power of Attorney was executed in his favour on the th of December The agent it is alleged by the petitioner wanted to have his own way in all the affairs of the <ORG> and paid no regard whatsoever to the wishes of the <NAME> In this state of affairs the <NAME> on the th of September served a notice upon the agent terminating his agency and calling upon him to hand over to the <ORG> all account papers and vouchers relating to the institution together with the cash in hand Far from complying with this demand the agent who was supported by the aforesaid <NAME> questioned the authority of the <NAME> to cancel his agency and threatened that he would refer the matter for action to the <ORG> On the th of October the petitioner filed a suit against the agent in <ORG> for recovery of the account books and other articles belonging to the <ORG> for rendering an account of the management and also for an injunction restraining the said agent from interfering with the affairs of the <ORG> under colour of the authority conferred by <ORG> which the plaintiff had cancelled The said <NAME> anticipating this suit filed an application to the <ORG> on the rd of October complaining against the cancellation of <ORG> and his management of the <ORG> A copy of the plaint filed in that suit was also sent along with the reply The <ORG> it appears dropped that enquiry but without waiting for the result of the suit initiated proceedings suo moto under section of the Earlier Act and issued a notice upon the <NAME> on the th of November stating that it had reason to believe that the endowments of the said <ORG> were being mismanaged and that a scheme should be framed for the administration of its affairs The notice was served by affixture on the <NAME> and the th of December was fixed as the date of enquiry On the th of December an application was filed on behalf of the <NAME> praying to the <ORG> to issue a direction to the agent to hand over the account papers and other documents without which it was not possible for him to file his objections As the lawyer appearing for the <NAME> was unwell the matter was again adjourned till the th of January The <NAME> was not ready with his objections even on that date as his lawyer had no recovered from his illness and a telegram was sent to the <ORG> on the previous day requesting the latter to grant a further adjournment On the th of January the <NAME> it appears sent a written explanation to the <ORG> which the latter admittedly received on the th On the th of January the <NAME> received a notice from the <ORG> stating inter alia that the <ORG> was satisfied that in the interests of proper administration of the <ORG> and its endowments the settlement of a scheme was necessary A draft scheme was sent along with the notice and if the petitioner had any objections to the same he was required to send in his objections on or before the th of February as the On the th of February the peti tioner filed the petition out of which this appeal arises in <ORG> Madras praying for a writ of prohibition to prohibit the <ORG> from taking further steps in the matter of settling a scheme for the administration of the <ORG> It was alleged inter alia that the <ORG> was actuated by bias against the petitioner and the action taken by it with regard to the settling of a scheme was not a bona fide act at all The main contention however was that having regard to the fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution in matters of religion and religious institutions belonging to particular religious denominations the law regulating the framing of a scheme interfering with the management of the <ORG> and its affairs by the <ORG> conflicted with the provisions of art icles and of the Constitution and was hence void under article As has been stated already after the New Act came into force the petitioner was allowed to end his petition and the attack was now directed against the constitutional validity of the New Act which replaced the earlier legislation The learned Judges who heard the petition went into the matter with elaborate fullness both on the constitutional questions involved in it as well as on its merits On the merits it was held that in the circumstances of the case the action of the <ORG> was a perverse exercise of its jurisdiction and that it should not be allowed to proceed in regard to the settlement of the scheme On the constitutional issues raised in the case the learned Judges pronounced quite a number of sections of the New Act to be ultra vires the Constitution by reason of their being in conflict with the fundamental rights of the petitioner guaranteed under articles and of the Constitution In the result the rule nisi issued on the petition was made absolute and the Commissioner <ORG> Madras was prohibited from proceeding further with the framing of a scheme inregard to the petitioner <ORG> The Commisioner has now come up on appeal before us on the strength of a certificate granted by <ORG> under article of the Constitution The learned Advocate General for Madras who appeared in support of the appeal confined his arguments exclusively to the constitutional points involved in this case Although he had put in an application to urge grounds other than the constitutional grounds that application was not pressed and he did not challen the findings of fact upon which <ORG> based its decision on the merits of the petition The position therefore is that the order of <ORG> issuing the writ of prohibition against the appellant must stand irrespective of the decision which we light arrive at on the constitutional points raised before us It is not disputed that <ORG> is competent to enact laws on the subject of religious and charitable endowments which is covered by entry of List III in Schedule VII of the Constitution No question of legislative incompetency on the part of <ORG> to enact the legislation in question has been raised before us with the exception of the provision relating to payment of annual contribution contained in section of the impugned Act We will deal with this point separately later on All the other points canvassed before us relate to the constitutional validity or otherwise of the several provisions of the Act which have been held to be invalid by <ORG> on grounds of their being in conflict with the fundamental rights guaranteed under articles and of the Constitution In order to appreciate the contentions that have been advanced on these heads by the learned counsel on both sides it may be convenient to refer briefly to the scheme and the salient provisions of the Act As compared with the Earlier Act its scope is wider and it can be made applicable to purely charitable endowments by proper notification under section of the Act The State has also to be divided into a number of divisions and an Assistant Commissioner is to be placed in charge of each division Chapter III contains the general provisions relating to all religious institutions Under section the administration of religious endowments is placed under the general superintendence and control of the Commissioner and he is empowered to pass any orders which may be deemed necessary to ensure that such endowments are properly administered and their income is duly appropriated for the purposes for which they were founded or exist Section gives the Commissioner the Deputy and Assistant Commissioners and such other officers asmay be authorised in th is behalf the power to enter the premises of any religious institution or any place of worship for the purpose of exercising any power conferred or discharging any duty imposed by or under the Act The only restriction is that the officer exercising the power must be a Hindu Section makes it obligatory on the trustee of a religious institution to obey all lawful orders issued under the provisions of this Act by the <ORG> the Commissioner the Deputy Commissioner the <ORG> or the Assistant Commissioner Section imposes a duty on the trustee to furnish to the Commissioner such accounts returns reports and other information as the Commissioner may require Under section power is given to the Commissioner or any other officer authorised by him to inspect all movable and immovable properties appertaining to a religious institution Section lays down that although a trustee may incur expenditure for making arrangements for securing the health and comfort of pilgrims worshippers and other people when there is a surplus left after making adequate provision for purposes specified in section he shall be guided in such matters by all genera or special instructions which he may receive from the Commissioner or <ORG> Section deals with surplus funds which the trustee may apply wholly or in part with the permission in writing of the Deputy Commissioner for any of the purposes specified in section If the Commissioner thinks that a modification is necessary he shall submit the case to the <ORG> and the orders of the <ORG> would be final Section empowers the trustee to spend at his discretion and for purposes connected with the Math the Pathakanikas or gifts made to him personally but he is required to keep regular accounts of the receipts and expenditure of such personal gifts Under section a Deputy Commissioner is competent to frame a scheme for any religious institutions if he has reason to believe that in the interests of the proper administration of the trust any such scheme is necessary Section makes provision for application of the cy pres doctrine when the specific objects of the trust fail Chapter VI of the Act which comprises sections to deals with the notification of religious institutions A religious institution may be notified in accordance with the provisions laid down in this chapter Such notification remains in force for five years and the effect of it is to take over the administration and vest it in an executive officer appointed by the Commissioner Chapter VII deals with budgets accounts and audit and Chapter VIII relates to finance of their income on account of the services rendered to them by the <ORG> and their officers functioning under this Act Chapter IX is not material for our purpose and Chapter deals with provisions of a miscellaneous nature Section in Chapter prescribes the penalty for refusal by a trustee to comply with the provisions of the Act Section lays down that nothing contained in the Act shall be deemed to confer any power or impose any duty in contravention of the rights conferred on any religious denomination under clauses a and of article of the Constitution The learned Judges of <ORG> have taken the view that the respondent as <ORG> has certain well defined rights in the institution and its endowments which could be regarded as rights to property within the meaning of article of the Constitution The provisions of the Act to the extent that they take away or unduly restrict the power to exercise these rights are not reasonable restrictions within the meaning of article and must consequently be held invalid <ORG> has held in the second place that the respondent as the head and representative of a religious institution has a right guaranteed to him under article of the Constitution to practise and propagate freely the religion of which he and his followers profess to be adherents This right in the opinion of <ORG> has been affected by some of the provisions of the Act This religious denomination has a fundamental right under article to manage its own affairs in matters of religion through the <ORG> who is their spiritual head and superior and those provisions of the Act which substantially take away the rights of the <ORG> in this respect amount to violation of the fundamental right guaranteed under article This last point raises a wide issue and We propose to discuss it separately later on So far as the other three points are concerned we will have to examine first of all the general contentions that have been raised by the learned Attorney General who appeared for <ORG> as an intervener in this and other connected cases and the questions raised are whether these articles of the Constitution are at all available to the respondent in the present case and whether they give him any protection regarding the rights and privileges of the infraction of which he complains As regards article of the Constitution the question that requires consideration is whether the respondent as <NAME> has a right to property in the legal sense in the religious institution and its endowments which would enable him to claim the protection of this article A question is also formulated as to whether this article deals with concrete rights of property at all So far as article of the Constitution is concerned the point raised is whether this article which it is said is intended to protect religious freedom only so far as individuals are concerned can be invoked in favour of an institution or Organisation With regard to article the contention is that a <ORG> does not come within the description of a religious denomination as provided for in the article and even if it does what cannot be interfered with is its right to manage its own affairs in matters of religion only and nothing else It is said that the word it religion as used in this article should be taken in its strict etymological sense as distinguished from any kind of secular activity which may be connected in some way with religion on but does not form an essential part of it Reference is made in this connection to clause a of article and clause of article We will take up these points for consideration one after another As regards the property rights of a <NAME> it may not be possible to say in view of the pronouncements of <ORG> which have been accepted as good law in this country ever since that a <NAME> holds the <ORG> property as a lifetenant or that his position is similar to that of a Hindu widow in respect to her husband estate or of an English BishoP holding a benefice He may be as <ORG> says a manager or custodian of the institution who has to discharge the duties of a trustee and is answerable as such but he is not a mere manager and it would not be right to describe <ORG> as a mere office A superior of a <ORG> has not only duties to discharge in connection with the endowment but he has a personal interest of a beneficial character which is sanctioned by custom and is much larger than that of a <NAME> in the debutter property It was held by a Full Bench of <ORG> that <NAME>ship The effect of the first two decisions as <ORG> pointed out in the last case was to emphasise the propriet ary element in the <NAME> right and to show that though in some respects an anomaly it was an anomaly to be accepted as having been admitted into Hindu law from an early date There is no reason why the word property as used in article of the Constitution should not be given a liberal and wide connotation and should not be extended to those well recognised types of interest which have the insignia or characteristics of proprietary right As said above the ingredients of both office and property of duties and personal interest are blended together in the rights of a <NAME> and the <NAME> has the right to enjoy this property or beneficial interest so long as he is entitled to hold his office and as he is in charge of a public institution reasonable restrictions can always be placed upon his rights in the interest of the public A point was suggested by the learned AttorneyGeneral that as article deals only with the natural rights inherent in a citizen to acquire hold and dispose of property in the abstract without reference to rights to any particular property it can be of no real assistance to the respondent in the present case and article of the Constitution which deals with deprivation of property has no application here of decided by this court on the th December an opinion was expressed by <NAME> that article of the Constitution is concerned only with the abstract right and capacity to acquire hold and dispose of property and that it has no relation to concrete property rights This it may be noted was an expression of opinion by the learned Chief Justice alone and it was not the decision of the court for out of the other four learned Judges who together with the Chief Justice constituted the Bench two did not definitely agree with this view while the remaining two did not express any opinion one way or the other This point was not raised before us by the Advocate General for Madras who appeared in support of the appeal nor by any of the other counsel appearing in this case In our opinion it would not be proper to express any final opinion upon the point in the present case when we had not the advantage of any arguments addressed to us upon it We would prefer to proceed as this court has proceeded all along in dealing with similar cases in the past on the footing that article applies equally to concrete as well as abstract rights of property We now come to article which as its language indicates secures to every person subject to public order health and morality a freedom not only to entertain such religious belief as may be approved of by his judgment and conscience but also to exhibit his belief in such outward acts as he thinks proper and to propagate or disseminate his ideas for the edification of others it is his duty to practise and propagate the religious tenets of which he is an adherent and if any provision of law prevents him from propagating his doctrines that would certainly affect the religious freedom which is guaranteed to every person under article Institutions as such cannot practise or propagate religion it can be done only by individual persons and whether these person propagate their personal views or the tenets for which the institution stands is really immaterial for purposes The followers of <NAME> who are known by the name of <NAME> undoubtedly constitute a religious denomination and so do the followers of <NAME> and other religious teachers The question is whereas the line to be drawn between what are matters of religion and what are not It will be seen that besides the right to manage its own affairs in matters of religion which is given by clause the next two clauses of article guarantee to a religious denomination the right to acquire and own property and to administer such property in accordance with law The administration of its property by a religious denomination has thus been placed on a different footing from the right to manage its own affairs in matters of religion What then are matters of religion The word religion has not been defined in the Constitution and it is a term which is hardly susceptible of any rigid definition In an American case it has been said that the term religion has reference to one views of his relation to his Creator and to the obligations they impose of reverence for His Being and character and of obedience to His will Articles and of our Constitution are based for the most part upon article of the Constitution of Eire and we have great doubt whether a definition of religion as given above could have been in the minds of our Constitution makers when they framed the Constitution There are well known religions in India like Buddhism and Jainism which do not believe in God or in any Intelligent First Cause A religion may not only lay down a code of ethical rules for its followers to accept it might prescribe rituals and observances ceremonies and modes of worship which are regarded as integral parts of religion and these forms and observances might extend even to matters of food and dress The guarantee under our Constitution not only protects the freedom of religious opinion but it protects also acts done in pursuance of a religion and this is made clear by the use of the expression practice of religion in article It appears to me to be difficult to maintain this distinction as relevant to the interpretation of section The section refers in express terms to the exercise of religion and therefore it is intended to protect from the operation of any <ORG> laws acts which are done in the exercise of religion Restrictions by the <ORG> upon free exercise of religion are permitted both under articles and on grounds of public order Clause a of article reserves the right of the <ORG> to regulate or restrict any economic financial political and other secular activities which may be associated with religious practice and there is a further right given to the <ORG> by sub clause under which the <ORG> can Vide Adelaide Company The <ORG> legislate for social welfare and reform even though by so doing it might interfere with religious practices The contention formulated in such broad terms cannot we think be supported practices and should be regarded as matters of religion within the meaning of article We may refer in this connection to a few American and Australian cases all of which arose out of the activities of persons connected with the religious association known as <ORG> The legality of the action of the <ORG> was questioned by means of a writ petition before <ORG> and <ORG> held that the action of the <ORG> was justified and that section which guaranteed freedom of religion under the Australian Constitution was not in any way infringed by the National Security Regulations The point for decision by <ORG> was whether the requirement of participation in such a ceremony exacted from a child who refused upon sincere religious ground infringed the liberty of religion guaranteed by the First and the Fourteenth Amendments The court held by a majority that it did not and that it was within the province of the legislature and the school authorities to adopt appropriate means to evoke and foster a sentiment of There it was held overruling the earlier decision referred to above that the action of a <ORG> in making it compulsory for children in public schools to salute the flag and pledge allegiance constituted a violation of the First and the Fourteenth Amendments This difference in judicial opinion brings out forcibly the difficult task which a court has to perform in cases of this type where the freedom or religious convictions genuinely entertained by men come into conflict with the proper political attitude which is expected from citizens in matters of unity and solidarity of the <ORG> organization Here again it may be pointed out that a contrary view was taken only a few years before in the case of <NAME> <NAME> and it was held that a city ordinance which required that licence be procured and taxes paid for the business of selling books and pamphlets on the streets from house to house was applicable to a member of a religious Organisation who was engaged in selling the printed propaganda pamphlets without having complied with the provisions of the ordinance right to freedom of religion has been declared in unrestricted terms with An adjustment of the competing demands of the interests of Government and constitutional liberties is always a delicate and a difficult task and that is why we find difference of judicial opinion to such an extent in cases decided by the American courts where questions of religious freedom were involved Our Constitution makers however have embodied the limitations which have been evolved by judicial pronouncements in America or Australia in the Constitution itself and the language of articles and is sufficiently clear to enable us to determine without the aid of foreign authorities as to what matters come within the purview of religion and what do not or organization enjoys complete autonomy in the matter of deciding as to what rites and ceremonies are essential according to the tenets of the religion they hold and no outside authority has any jurisdiction to Of course the scale of expenses to be incurred in connection with these religious observances would be a matter of administration of property belonging to the religious denomination and can be controlled by secular authorities in accordance with any law laid down by a competent legislature for it could not be the injunction of any religion to destroy the institution and its endowments by incurring wasteful expenditure on rites and ceremonies A law which takes away the right of administration from the hands of a religious denomination altogether and vests it in any other authority would amount to a violation of the right guaranteed under clause of article Having thus disposed of the general contentions that were raised in this appeal we will proceed now to examine the specific grounds that have been urged by the parties before us in regard to the decision of <ORG> so far as it declared several sections of the new Act to be ultra vires the Constitution by reason of their conflicting with the fundamental rights of the respondent The sections of the new Act are sections section to the extent section is made applicable section though it sounds innocuous it is liable to abuse as we have already pointed out earlier in the judgment section clause of section section section section section because courts have ample powers to meet these contingencies section clause of section section clause of section sections to in Chapter VI clauses and of section section section and section to the extent it gives the <ORG> virtually complete control over the Matadhipati and Maths It may be pointed out at the outset that the learned Judges were not right in including sections and in this list as these sections are not applicable to Maths under the Act itself This position has not been disputed by Mr <NAME> who appears for the respondent Section of the Act describes the powers of the Commissioner in respect to religious endowments and they include power to pass any orders that may be deemed necessary to ensure that such endowments are properly administered and that their income is duly appropriated for the purposes for which they were founded Having regard to the fact that the <ORG> occupies the position of a trustee with regard to the <ORG> which is a public institution some amount of control or supervision over the due administration of the endowments and due appropriation of their funds is certainly necessary in the interest of the public and we do not think that the provision of this section by itself offends any fundamental right of the <NAME> No doubt the Commissioner is invested with powers to pass orders but orders can be passed only for the purposes specified in the section and not for interference with the rights of the <NAME> as are sanctioned by usage or for lowering his position as the spiritual head of the institution An apprehension that the powers conferred by this section may be abused in individual cases does not make the provision itself bad or invalid in law We agree however with <ORG> in the view taken by it about section This section empowers the Commissioner and his subordinate officers and also persons authorised by them to enter the premises of any religious institution or place of worship for the purpose of exercising any power conferred or any duty imposed by or under the Act There are also fixed hours of worship and rest for the idol when no disturbance by any member of the public is allowed We think that as the section stands it interferes with the fundamental rights of the <ORG> and the denomination of which he is head guaranteed under articles and of the Constitution We cannot agree with this contention Clause again does not say anything about custom or usage obtaining in an institution and it does not indicate by whom and in what manner the question of interference with the religious and spiritual functions of the <ORG> would be decided in case of any dispute arising regarding it Section imposes a duty upon the trustees to obey all lawful orders issued be the Commissioner or any subordinate authority under the provisions of the Act No exception can be taken to the section if those provisions of the Act which offend against the fund mental rights of the respondent are left out of account as being invalid is directed to obey orders issued in pursuance of valid legal authority The same reason would in our opinion apply to section As regards section <ORG> has taken exception only to clause of the section We are unable therefore to agree with the view expressed by the learned Judges ordinarily inalienable we fail to see why the restrictions placed by Section upon alienation of endowed properties should be considered bad In our opinion the provision of clause of section which enables the Commissioner to impose conditions when he grants sanction to alienation of endowed property is perfectly reasonable and to that no exception can be taken Clause of the section enables a trustee to incur expenditure out of the funds in his charge after making adequate provision for the purposes referred to in section for making arrangements for the health safety and convenience of disciples pilgrims etc If the trustee is to be guided but not fettered by such directions possibly no objection can be taken to this clause but if he is bound to carry out such instructions we do think that it constitutes an encroachment on his right Under the law as it stands the <NAME> has large powers of disposal over the surplus income and the only restriction is that he cannot spend anything out of it for his personal use unconnected with the dignity of his office But as the purposes specified in sub clauses a and of section are beneficial to the institution there seems to be no reason why the authority vested in the <NAME> to spend the surplus income for such purposes should be taken away from him and he should be compelled to act in such matters under the instructions of the Government officers The same reason applies in our opnion to section of the Act the meaning of which also is far from clear If after making adequate provision for the purposes referred to in section and for the arrangements mentioned in section there is still a surplus left with the trustee section enables him to spend it for the purposes specified in section with the previous sanction of the Deputy Commissioner One of the purposes mentioned in section is the propagation of the religious tenents of the institution and it is not understood why sanction of the Deputy Commissioner should be necessary for spending the surplus income for the propagation of the religious tenets of the order which is one of the primary duties of a <NAME> to discharge The next thing that strikes one is whether sanction is necessary if the trustee wants to spend the money for purposes other than those specified in section If the answer is in the nega tive the whole object of the section becomes meaningless If on the other hand the implication of the section is that the surplus can be spent only for the purposes specified in section and that too with the permission of the Deputy Commissioner it undoubtedly places a burdensome restriction upon the property rights of the <NAME> which are sanctioned by usage and which would have the effect of impairing his dignity and efficiency as the head of the institution There seems to be nothing wrong or unreasonable in section of the Act which provides for fixing the standard scale of expenditure The proposals for this purpose would have to be submitted by the trustee they are then to be published and suggestions invited from persons having interest in the amendment suggestions received and if in his opinion a modification of the scale is necessary he has to submit a report to the <ORG> whose decision will be final Section deals with a <NAME> power over Pathakanikas or personal gifts Ordinarily a <NAME> has absolute power of disposal over such gifts though if he dies without making any disposition it is reckoned as the property of the <ORG> and goes to the succeeding <NAME> It may be that according to customs prevailing in a particular institution such personal gifts are regarded as gifts to the institution itself and the <NAME> receives them only as the representative of the institution but the general rule is otherwise As section does not say that this rule will apply only when there is a custom of that nature in a particular institution we must say that the provision in this unrestricted form is an unreasonable encroachment upon the fundamental right of the <NAME> The same objection can be raised against clause of the section for if the Pathakanikas constitute the property of a <NAME> there is no justification for compelling him to keep accounts of the receipts and expenditure of such personal gifts As said already if the <NAME> dies without disposing of these personal gifts they may form part of the assets of the <ORG> but that is no reason for restricting the powers of the <NAME> over these gifts so long as he is alive It makes provision of an extremely drastic character Power has been given to the Commissioner to require the trustee to appoint a manager for administration of the secular affairs of the institution and in case of default the Commissioner can make the appointment The effect of the section really is that the Commissioner is at liberty at any moment he chooses to deprive the <NAME> of his right to administer the trust property even if there is no negligence or maladministration on his part We find nothing wrong in section of the Act which relates to the framing of the scheme by the Deputy Commissioner It is true that it is a <ORG> officer and not the court who is given the power to settle the scheme but we think that sample safeguards have been provided in the Act to rectify any error or unjust decision made by the Deputy Commissioner Section provides for an appeal to the Commissioner against the order of the Deputy Commissioner and there is a right of suit given to a party who is aggrieved by the order of the Commissioner with a further right of appeal to <ORG> Section simply provides a scheme for the application of the cy pres doctrine in case the object of the trust fails either from the inception or by reason of subsequent eve We think that this objection has not much substance Further an appeal has been provided from an order of the Deputy Commissioner under this section to the Commissioner Chapter VI of the Act which contains sections to relates to notification of religious institutions The provisions are extremely drastic in their character and the worst feature of it is that no access is allowed to the court to set aside an order of notification We hold therefore in agreement with <ORG> that these sections should Objection has been taken only to clause which empowers the Commissioner and <ORG> to make any additions to or alterations in the budget as they deem fit Section provides for penalties for refusal by the trustee to comply with the provisions of the Act Section vests an overall revisional power in the <ORG> This in our opinion is beneficial to the trustee for he will have an opportunity to approach the <ORG> in case of an irregularity error or omission made by the Commissioner or any other subordinate officer The only other point that requires consideration is the constitutional validity of section of the Act which runs as follows In respect of the services rendered by the Government and their officers every religious institution shall from the income derived by it pay to the Government annually such contribution not exceeding five per centum of its income as may be prescribed Every religious institution the annual income of which for the fasli year immediately preceding as calculated for the purposes of the levy of contribution under sub section is hot less than one thousand rupees shall pay to the Government annually for meeting the cost of auditing its accounts such further sum not exceeding one and a half per centum of its income as the Commissioner may determine The Government shall pay the salaries allowances pensions and other beneficial remuneration of the Commissioner Deputy Commissioners Assistant Commissioners and other officers and servants other than executive officers of religious institutions employed for the purposes of this Act and the other expenses incurred for such purposes including the expenses of Area Committees and the cost of auditing the accounts of religious institutions Thus the section authorises the levy of an annual contribution on all religious institutions the maximum of which is fixed at per cent The <ORG> is to frame rules for the purposes of fixing rates within the permissible maximums and the section expressly states that the levy is in respect of the I services rendered by the <ORG> and its officers The other is that the contribution being a tax or imposition the proceeds of which are specifically appropriated for the maintenance of a particular religion or religious denomination it comes within the mischief of article of the Constitution and is hence void <NAME> So far as the first ground is concerned it is not disputed that the legislation in the present case is covered by entries and of List III in Schedule VII of the Constitution If the contribution payable under section of the Act is a fee it may come under entry of the Concurrent List which deals with fees in respect of any of the matters included in that list On the other hand if it is a tax as this particular tax has not been provided for in any specific entry in any of the three lists it could come only under entry of List I or article of the Constitution and in either view <ORG> alone would be competent to legislate upon it On behalf of the appellant the contention raised is that the contribution levied is a fee and not a tax and the learned Attorney General who appeared for <ORG> as intervener in this as well as in the other connected appeals made a strenuous attempt to support this position The learned Attorney General has argued in the first place that our Constitution makes a clear distinction between taxes and fees It is true as <NAME> has pointed out that there are a number of entries in List I of the Seventh Schedule which relate to taxes and duties of various sorts whereas the last entry namely entry speaks of fees in respect of any of the matters dealt with in the list Extractly the same is with regard to entries to in List II all of which relate to taxes and here again the last entry deals only with fees leviable in respect of the different matters specified in the list It appears that articles II and of the Constitution which deal with Money Bills lay down expressly that a bill will not be deemed to be a Money Bill by reason only that it provides for the imposition of fines or for the demand or payment of fees for licences or fees for services rendered whereas a bill dealing with imposition or regulation It seems to us that though levying of fees is only a particular form of the exercise of the taxing power of the <ORG> our Constitution has placed fees uder a separate category for purposes of legislation and at the end of each one of the three legislative lists it has given a power to the particular legislature to legislate on the imposition of fees in respect to every one of the items dealt with in the list itself The question for our consideration really is what are the indicia or special characteristics that distinguish a fee from a tax proper On this point we have been referred to several authorities by the learned counsel appearing for the different parties including opinions expressed by writers of recognised treatises on public finance It is said that the essence of taxation is compulsion that is to say it is imposed under statutory power without the taxpayer consent and the payment is enforced by law The second characteristic of tax is that it is an imposition made for public purpose without reference to any special benefit to be conferred on the payer of the tax object of a tax is not to confer any special benefit upon any particular individual there is as it is said no element of quid pro quo between the taxpayer and the public authority Coming now to fees a fee is generally defined to be a charge for a special service rendered to individuals by some governmental agency The amount of fee levied is supposed to be based on the expenses incurred by the <ORG> in rendering the service though in many cases the costs are arbitrarily assessed Ordinarily the fees are uniform and no account is taken of the vary abilities of different recipients to pay As regards the distinction between a tax and a fee it is argued in the first place on behalf of the respondent that a fee is something voluntary which a person has got to pay if he wants certain services from the Government but there is no obligation on his part to seek such services and if he does not want the services I he can avoid the obligation If a man wants a licence that is entirely his own choice and then only he has to pay the fees but not otherwise The house tax has to be paid only by those who own houses the land tax by those who possess lands municipal taxes or rates will fall on those who have properties within a see <NAME> on Science of Public Finance Vol Persons who do not have houses land or Properties within municipalities would not have to pay these taxes but nevertheless these impositions come within the category of taxes and nobody can say that it is a choice of these people to own lands or houses or specified kinds of properties so that there is no compulsion on them to pay taxes at all Compulsion lies in the fact that payment is enforceable by law against a man in spite of his unwillingness or want of consent and this element is present in taxes as well as in fees The distinction between a tax and a fee lies primarily in the fact that a tax is levied he a part of a common burden while a fee is a payment for a special benefit or privilege Public interest seems to be at the basis of all impositions but in a fee it is some special benefit which the individual receives If as we hold a fee is regarded as a sort of return or consideration for services rendered it is absolutely necessary that the levy of fees should on the face of the legislative provision be co related to the expenses incurred by <ORG> in rendering the services As indicated in article of the Constitution ordinarily there are two classes of cases where <ORG> imposes fees upon persons If the money thus paid is set apart and appropriated specifically for the performance of such work and is not merged in the public revenues for the benefit of the general public it could be counted as fees and not a tax There is really no generic difference between the tax and fees and as said by <NAME> the taxing power of a State may manifest itself in three different forms known respectively as special assessments fees and taxes Our Constitution has for legislative purposes made a distinction between a tax and a fee and while there are various entries in the legislative lists with regard to various forms of taxes there is an entry at the end of each one of the three lists as regards fees which could be levied in respect of any of the matters that is included in it It is true that religious institutions do not want these services to be rendered to them and it Vide Spligman Essays on Taxation lbid may be that they do not consider the <ORG> interference to be a benefit at all We agree however with the learned Attorney General that in the present day concept of a <ORG> it cannot be said that services could be rendered by the <ORG> only at the request of those who require these services annually are excluded from the liability to pay the additional charges under clause of the section But the material fact which negatives the theory of fees in the present case is that the money raised by levy of the contribution is not ear marked or specified for defraying the expenses that the <ORG> has to incur in performing the services All the collections go to the consolidated fund of the <ORG> and all the expenses have to be met not out of these collections but out of the general revenues by a proper method of appropriation as is done in case of other <ORG> expenses That in itself might not be conclusive but in this case there is total absences of any co relation between the expenses incurred by the <ORG> and the amount raised by contribution under the provision of section and in these circumstances the theory of a return or counter payment or quid pro quo cannot have any possible application to this case It is a secular administration of the religious legislature seeks to control and the in the Act is to ensure that the institutions that the object as enunciated endowments attached to the religious institutions are properly administered and their income is duly appropriated for the purposes for which they were founded or exist The result therefore is that in our opinion sections and to are the only sections which should be declared invalid as conflicting with the fundamental rights of the respondent as <ORG>adhipati of the <ORG> in question and section is void as beyond the legislative competence of <ORG> The decision of <ORG> will be modified to this extent but as the judgment of <ORG> is affirmed on its merits the appeal will stand dismissed with costs to the respondent
