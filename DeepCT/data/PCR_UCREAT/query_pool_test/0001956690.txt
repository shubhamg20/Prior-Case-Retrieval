Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment rendered by <ORG> of <ORG> at Jodhpur confirming the death sentence awarded to the appellant for commission of offence punishable under Section of the Indian Penal Code in short the IPC Appellant also filed an appeal and both the case under reference and the appeal were taken up together and disposed of by a common judgment On this information police registered a case for offence punishable under Section I and proceeded with investigation After usual investigation police laid charge sheet against the appellant for offence punishable under Section I On being committed the appellant was tried of the charge of offence punishable under Section I by the court of Additional Sessions Judge Fast Track <NAME> The trial court on consideration of the evidence led by the prosecution found the appellant guilty of offence under Section I <ORG> relied upon the following circumstances to find the accused guilty Extra judicial confession made by the appellant before <NAME> PW <NAME> PW <NAME> PW and <NAME> PW The presence of the appellant in the house wherein the alleged incident took place At the time of hearing the reference and the appeal the primary stand taken by the accused appellant was that the extra judicial confession relied upon by the prosecution is not correct There is no reason as to why they would falsely implicate the accused appellant by making an untruthful statement The circumstances highlighted by the prosecution according to <ORG> presented a complete chain of circumstances Though it was submitted by the accused appellant that even if the prosecution case was accepted in its totality there was no special reason to impose the death sentence <ORG> was of the view that the appellant had acted in a most cruel and diabolic manner There was not even any remorse for such gruesome acts He made a declaration of his act of abusing his wife and children The stand taken by the accused appellant before <ORG> was re iterated in this appeal It has been consistently laid down by this Court that where a case rests squarely on circumstantial evidence the inference of guilt can be justified only when all the incriminating facts and circumstances are found to be incompatible with the innocence of the accused or the guilt of any other person The circumstances from which an inference as to the guilt of the accused is drawn have to be proved beyond reasonable doubt and have to be shown to be closely connected with the principal fact sought to be inferred from those circumstances wherein it has been observed thus In a case based on circumstantial evidence the settled law is that the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is drawn should be fully proved and such circumstances must be conclusive in nature Moreover all the circumstances should be complete and there should be no gap left in the chain of evidence AIR SC it was laid down that when a case rests upon circumstantial evidence such evidence must satisfy the following tests the circumstances from which an inference of guilt is sought to be drawn must be cogently and firmly established those circumstances should be of a definite tendency unerringly pointing towards guilt of the accused the circumstances taken cumulatively should form a chain so complete that there is no escape from the conclusion that within all human probability the crime was committed by the accused and none else and the circumstantial evidence in order to sustain conviction must be complete and incapable of explanation of any other hypothesis than that of the guilt of the accused and such evidence should not only be consistent with the guilt of the accused but should be inconsistent with his innocence It was also pointed out that the circumstances relied upon must be found to have been fully established and the cumulative effect of all the facts so established must be consistent only with the hypothesis of guilt Sir <NAME> in his admirable book Wills Circumstantial Evidence Chapter VI lays down the following rules specially to be observed in the case of circumstantial evidence the facts alleged as the basis of any legal inference must be clearly proved and beyond reasonable doubt connected with the factum probandum the burden of proof is always on the party who asserts the existence of any fact which infers legal accountability in all cases whether of direct or circumstantial evidence the best evidence must be adduced which the nature of the case admits in order to justify the inference of guilt the inculpatory facts must be incompatible with the innocence of the accused and incapable of explanation upon any other reasonable hypothesis than that of his guilt if there be any reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused he is entitled as of right to be acquitted There is no doubt that conviction can be based solely on circumstantial evidence but it should be tested by the touch stone of law relating to circumstantial evidence laid down by <ORG> as far back as in In <NAME> and <NAME> of Madhya Pradesh AIR SC wherein it was observed thus It is well to remember that in cases where the evidence is of a circumstantial nature the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should be in the first instance be fully established and all the facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused In other words there must be a chain of evidence so far complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for a conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and it must be such as to show that within all human probability the act must have been done by the accused Therein while dealing with circumstantial evidence it has been held that onus was on the prosecution to prove that the chain is complete and the infirmity of lacuna in prosecution cannot be cured by false defence or plea The conditions precedent in the words of this Court before conviction could be based on circumstantial evidence must be fully established The circumstances concerned must or should and not may be established the facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused that is to say they should not be explainable on any other hypothesis except that the accused is guilty the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency they should exclude every possible hypothesis except the one to be proved and there must be a chain of evidence so compete as not to leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and must show that in all human probability the act must have been done by the accused The only other thing which needs consideration is whether death sentence as awarded by trial Court is proper Section prescribes death or life imprisonment as the penalty for murder While doing so the Code instructs the court as to its application The changes which the Code has undergone in the last three decades clearly indicate that <ORG> is taking note of contemporary criminological thought and movement It is not difficult to discern that in the Code there is a definite swing towards life imprisonment There is another provision in the Code which also uses the significant expression special reason Section of the Code re enacts in substance Section of the Criminal Procedure Code in short the old Code Section which is a new provision in the Code makes it mandatory for the court to record special reasons for not applying the provisions of Section Section thus casts a duty upon the court to apply the provisions of Section wherever it is possible to do so and to state special reasons if it does not do so In the context of Section the special reasons contemplated by Section must be such as to compel the court to hold that it is impossible to reform and rehabilitate the offender after examining the matter with due regard to the age character and antecedents of the offender and the circumstances in which the offence was committed Section and Section have both entered the statute book at the same time and they are part of the emerging picture of acceptance by the legislature of the new trends in criminology It would not therefore be wrong to assume that the personality of the offender as revealed by his age character antecedents and other circumstances and the tractability of the offender to reform must necessarily play the most prominent role in determining the sentence to be awarded Special reasons must have some relation to these factors Criminal justice deals with complex human problems and diverse human beings A Judge has to balance the personality of the offender with the circumstances situations and the reactions and choose the appropriate sentence to be imposed It should be borne in mind that before the amendment of Section of the old Code by the Criminal Procedure Code Amendment Act which came into force on on a conviction for an offence punishable with death if the court sentenced the accused to any punishment other than death the reason why sentence of death was not passed had to be stated in the judgment After the amendment of Section of the old Code by Act of it is not correct to hold that the normal penalty of imprisonment for life cannot be awarded in the absence of extenuating circumstances which reduce the gravity of the offence The matter is left after the amendment to the discretion of the court The court must however take into account all the circumstances and state its reasons for whichever of the two sentences it imposes in its discretion Therefore the former rule that the normal punishment for murder is death is no longer operative and it is now within the discretion of the court to pass either of the two sentences prescribed in this section but whichever of the two sentences he passes the Judge must give his reasons for imposing a particular sentence The amendment of Section of the old Code does not affect the law regulating punishment under IPC This amendment relates to procedure and now courts are no longer required to elaborate the reasons for not awarding the death penalty but they cannot depart from sound judicial considerations preferring the lesser punishment Section of the Code marks a significant shift in the legislative policy underlying the old Code as in force immediately before according to which both the alternative sentences of death or imprisonment for life provided for murder were normal sentences The court is required to state the reasons for the sentence awarded and in the case of death sentence special reasons are required to be stated that is to say only special facts and circumstances will warrant the passing of the death sentence It is in the light of these successive legislative changes in the Code that the judicial decisions prior to the amendment made by Act of and again Act of have to be understood SCC has observed SCC pp Let us crystallize the positive indicators against death sentence under Indian law currently Where the murderer is too young or too old the clemency or penal justice helps him Where the offender suffers from socio economic psychic or penal compulsions insufficient to attract a legal exception or to downgrade the crime into a lesser one judicial commutation is permissible Other general social pressures warranting judicial notice with an extenuating impact may in special cases induce the lesser penalty Extraordinary features in the judicial process such as that the death sentence has hung over the head of the culprit excruciatingly long may persuade the court to be compassionate Likewise if others involved in the crime and similarly situated have received the benefit of life imprisonment or if the offence is only constructive being under Section read with Section or again the accused has acted suddenly under another instigation without premeditation perhaps the court may humanely opt for life even like where a just cause or real suspicion of wifely infidelity pushed the criminal into the crime On the other hand the weapons used and the manner of their use the horrendous features of the crime and hapless helpless state of the victim and the like steel the heart of the law for a sterner sentence We cannot obviously feed into a judicial computer all such situations since they are astrological imponderables in an imperfect and undulating society A legal policy on life or death cannot be left for ad hoc mood or individual predilection and so we have sought to objectify to the extent possible abandoning retributive ruthlessness amending the deterrent creed and accenting the trend against the extreme and irrevocable penalty of putting out of life In <NAME> case supra it has been observed that <ORG> para A real and abiding concern for the dignity of human life postulates resistance to taking a life through law instrumentality A balance sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances has to be drawn up and in doing so the mitigating circumstances have to be accorded full weightage and a just balance has to be struck between the aggravating and the mitigating circumstances before the option is exercised In order to apply these guidelines inter alia the following questions may be asked and answered a is there something uncommon about the crime which renders sentence of imprisonment for life inadequate and calls for a death sentence and are the circumstances of the crime such that there is no alternative but to impose death sentence even after according maximum weightage to the mitigating circumstances which speak in favour of the offender Another decision which illuminatingly deals with the question of death sentence is <NAME> case supra In <NAME> supra and <NAME> supra cases the guidelines which are to be kept in view when considering the question whether the case belongs to the rarest of the rare category were indicated In <NAME> case supra it was observed SCC para The following questions may be asked and answered as a test to determine the rarest of the rare case in which death sentence can be inflicted a Is there something uncommon about the crime which renders sentence of imprisonment for life inadequate and calls for a death sentence Are the circumstances of the crime such that there is no alternative but to impose death sentence even after according maximum weightage to the mitigating circumstances which speak in favour of the offender The following guidelines which emerge from <NAME> case supra will have to be applied to the facts of each individual case where the question of imposition of death sentence arises SCC para i The extreme penalty of death need not be inflicted except in gravest cases of extreme culpability ii Before opting for the death penalty the circumstances of the offender also require to be taken into consideration along with the circumstances of the crime Death sentence must be imposed only when life imprisonment appears to be an altogether inadequate punishment having regard to the relevant circumstances of the crime and provided and only provided the option to impose sentence of imprisonment for life cannot be conscientiously exercised having regard to the nature and circumstances of the crime and all the relevant circumstances iv A balance sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances has to be drawn up and in doing so the mitigating circumstances have to be accorded full weightage and a just balance has to be struck between the aggravating and the mitigating circumstances before the option is exercised In rarest of rare cases when collective conscience of the community is so shocked that it will expect the holders of the judicial power centre to inflict death penalty irrespective of their personal opinion as regards desirability or otherwise of retaining death penalty death sentence can be awarded The community may entertain such sentiment in the following circumstances When the murder is committed in an extremely brutal grotesque diabolical revolting or dastardly manner so as to arouse intense and extreme indignation of the community When the murder is committed for a motive which evinces total depravity and meanness murder by hired assassin for money or reward or a cold blooded murder for gains of a person vis vis whom the murderer is in a dominating position or in a position of trust or murder is committed in the course for betrayal of the motherland is committed not for personal reasons but in circumstances which arouse social wrath or in cases of bride burning or dowry deaths or when murder is committed in order to remarry for the sake of extracting dowry once again or to marry another woman on account of infatuation When the victim of murder is an innocent child or a helpless woman or old or infirm person or a person vis vis whom the murderer is in a dominating position or a public figure generally loved and respected by the community If upon taking an overall global view of all the circumstances in the light of the aforesaid propositions and taking into account the answers to the questions posed by way of the test for the rarest of rare cases the circumstances of the case are such that death sentence is warranted the court would proceed to do so A convict hovers between life and death when the question of gravity of the offence and award of adequate sentence comes up for consideration Mankind has shifted from the state of nature towards a civilized society and it is no longer the physical opinion of the majority that takes away the liberty of a citizen by convicting him and making him suffer a sentence of imprisonment Award of punishment following conviction at a trial in a system wedded to the rule of law is the outcome of cool deliberation in the court room after adequate hearing is afforded to the parties accusations are brought against the accused the prosecuted is given an opportunity of meeting the accusations by establishing his innocence It is the outcome of cool deliberations and the screening of the material by the informed man i the Judge that leads to determination of the lis The principle of proportion between crime and punishment is a principle of just desert that serves as the foundation of every criminal sentence that is justifiable Indeed the requirement that punishment not be disproportionately great which is a corollary of just desert is dictated by the same principle that does not allow punishment of the innocent for any punishment in excess of what is deserved for the criminal conduct is punishment without guilt The criminal law adheres in general to the principle of proportionality in prescribing liability according to the culpability of each kind of criminal conduct It ordinarily allows some significant discretion to the Judge in arriving at a sentence in each case presumably to permit sentences that reflect more subtle considerations of culpability that are raised by the special facts of each case Judges in essence affirm that punishment ought always to fit the crime yet in practice sentences are determined largely by other considerations Sometimes the desirability of keeping him out of circulation and sometimes even the traffic results of his crime Inevitably these considerations cause a departure from just desert as the basis of punishment and create cases of apparent injustice that are serious and widespread Proportion between crime and punishment is a goal respected in principle and in spite of errant notions it remains a strong influence in the determination of sentences The practice of punishing all serious crimes with equal severity is now unknown in civilized societies but such a radical departure from the principle of proportionality has disappeared from the law only in recent times Even now a single grave infraction that is thought to call for uniformly drastic measures Anything less than a penalty of greatest severity for any serious crime is thought then to be a measure of toleration that is unwarranted and unwise But in fact quite apart from those considerations that make punishment unjustifiable when it is out of proportion to the crime uniformly disproportionate punishment has some very undesirable practical consequences Section deals with act of a person incapable of judgment by reason of intoxication caused against his will There is no specific plea taken in the present case about intoxicant having administered without appellant knowledge The brutal acts done by the accused appellant are diabolic in conception and cruel in execution Merely because he claims to be a drunk at the relevant point of time that does not in any way get diluted not because of what is provided in Section but because one after another five lives were taken and that too of four young children This case squarely falls under the rarest of rare category to warrant death sentence The appeal deserves dismissal which we direct
