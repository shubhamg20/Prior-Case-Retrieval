These appeals arise from an order of <NAME> dismissing two connected petitions one to quash a penalty of Rs in lieu of confiscation of goods under Section a of the Madras General Sales Tax Act and the other for a direction to the respondents to deliver to the appellant the goods which had been seized and confiscated while on transit at Kandaigoundan Chavadi check post which is the border of Coimbatore district in this State and Calicut in the Kerala State On the ground that the lorry attempted to transport without any sale bill or delivery note for the maida and khandasari sugar and on suspicion that there was an attempt at evasion of tax the Check post Officer by an order dated nd March confiscated the goods but gave an option to the appellant to pay a penalty of Rs The Check post Officer declined to accept the explanation of the appellant which was that he had purchased in Madras bags of atta bags of maida and in Nellore bags of khandasari sugar he being of the view as we said that there was really an attempt to suppress the sales of the maida and khandasari sugar under the cloak of the sale bill and delivery note for atta only Before <NAME> no attempt appears to have been made to challenge the validity of the penalty order on its merits and the learned Judge proceeded on the basis that in the exercise of writ jurisdiction the finding of the Check post Officer that the explanation of the appellant was not acceptable could not be revised The section also provided for levy of penalty in lieu of such confiscation Clause a of the second proviso to Section which was introduced by a latter amendment stated that in cases where the goods are taxable under this Act in addition to the tax recoverable a sum of money not exceeding one thousand rupees or double the amount of tax recoverable whichever is greater may be levied as penalty in lieu of confiscation <ORG> with reference to this provision observed at page But under Clause a of the second proviso the tax is ordered to be recovered even before the sale in addition to the penalty not exceeding Rs In the words of <ORG> at page We are therefore of opinion that Clause a of the second proviso being repugnant to the entire scheme of the Act in so far as it provides for recovery of tax even before the first sale in this State which is the point of time in a large majority of cases for recovery of tax must fall on the ground of repugnancy We therefore agree with <ORG> and strike down Sub section but for reasons different from those which commended themselves to <ORG> In so holding <ORG> made it clear that it did not propose to decide the general question whether a power to confiscate goods found on search and not accounted for in the books of account of the dealer was an ancillary power necessary for the purpose of stopping evasion of tax Section of the Act with which we are concerned in the appeals before us is substantially in pari materia if not identical with Section the only difference being that unlike the latter which provides for goods searched and seized in the premises of the dealer which are not accounted for the former concerns itself with goods under transport by any vehicle or boat across the check post or barrier and not covered by the specified documents The separate and independent reasoning on the basis of which this <ORG> and the Supreme <ORG> struck down Section as invalid seems as we think to apply with equal force to the invalidity of Section <NAME> however felt that there was difference between Section and Section but he did not proceed to detail the difference As far as we are able to see except the difference which we mentioned there is no other existing between the language scheme object and effect of the two provisions The learned Judge having noticed the two decisions one of this <ORG> and the other of the Supreme <ORG> that the ratio or the principle of those decisions will not apply to the facts of the petitions before him because in his opinion it had been established by the finding of the Check post Officer that the taxable event had occurred and the transactions become exigible to tax In such a case the learned Judge was of opinion that there might be room to hold that the power to seize and confiscate the goods was ancillary to the power to tax and further the basis of the reasoning of the Supreme <ORG> that a power to confiscate even before the taxable event had occurred that is to say a sale or purchase was inconsistent with the scheme of the Act which was to charge first sales or purchases in the State was not present here Legislative competency to provide for confiscation of goods entirely depends on whether such a power is ancillary or incidental to a power to check evasion of tax or to make it unprofitable which is undoubtedly a part of the power to tax on sale or purchase of goods That conclusion rested entirely on the scope and ambit of Entry in List II of the Constitution not on the factual position whether a sale or purchase had in a given case taken place The learned Judge as we have already mentioned was of opinion that there might be room to hold that the power to seize and confiscate goods was ancillary to the power to tax sales where a sale in a given case had taken place Nor the fact that a sale or purchase had taken place in a given case could make any difference to the invalidity of Section because that question depended on the actual language employed by the <ORG> The vice according to the Supreme <ORG> which invalidated Section lay in the fact that it charged goods to tax even before the taxable event has occurred which is repugnant to the entire scheme of the Act That repugnancy is not solved by stating that the Check post Officer has found that there has been a sale or purchase in respect of the goods seized and confiscated Even so it is nobody case that the first sales or any sales for that matter have been effected by the appellant In such circumstances two things will follow one is if there is evasion of tax it is not on the part of the appellant Before we leave this case there is one other matter to which we would like to make reference That made all the difference as <ORG> itself pointed out because the main body of Sub section of Section as was held by <ORG> ought to be read as qualified by and in the sense of the two provisos to Section The appeals are allowed with costs throughout In the circumstances this will be taken note of and the respondents will pay the sale proceeds of the khandasari sugar to the appellant
