This is a reference to <ORG> made in certain appeals against orders which arose under the circumstances mentioned in the order of reference I shall proceed on the basis assumed in the order of reference that the question that has arisen relates to execution discharge or satisfaction of the decree within the meaning of Section and that all that we are asked is whether such a question arose between the parties to the suit in which the decree was passed or their representatives As I understand the facts the question in the appeal arose in execution of the mortgage decree and so far as the decree holder purchaser is concerned there can be no question of his position as he is a party to the suit <NAME> the other learned Judge did not express any dissent from that view but pointed out that the order was none the less an order under Section now Section because it was also passed under Sections and of the Code of Civil Procedure corresponding to Rules and of Order of the Code of Civil Procedure In this Court therefore the conflict of opinion on the point is such that one could not say that there is a clear preponderance of authority in support of one view rather than the other As regards the other <ORG> it was held by Jenkins <NAME> <NAME> I that an auction purchaser could not be regarded as the representative of the decree holder for the purposes of an application under Section A of the Old Code but Order Rule of the New Code now expressly provides that person owning property which has been sold or holding an interest therein by virtue of a title acquire before such sale may also apply to have the sale set aside on depositing the purchase money As regards Calcutta and Allahabad no express ruling on the question has been cited before us and I have not found any On the question whether an auction purchaser can be treated as the representative of the judgment debtor we find a similar conflict in <NAME> <NAME> I <NAME> and <NAME> have finally decided in favour of the view that the word representative when taken with reference to the judgment debtor does not mean only his legal representative that is his heir executor or administrator but it means his representative in interest and includes a purchaser of his interest whether by a private sale or at court auction who so far as such interest is concerned is bound by the decree has ruled contrary to the view of the law as laid down by the Calcutta and Allahabad <ORG>es But that the two terms are not used in a synonymous sense is obvious for while in Section the legislature uses the word representative it uses the phrase legal representative as it were by contrast in Sections and and so on Nor can there be any doubt that the word representative was intended to have a wider meaning than legal representative I think some light can be obtained on this question if we find out in what matters the purchaser of the interest of the judgment debtor in property sold in execution can apply to the executing <ORG> for redress or can be proceeded against in that <ORG> This seems to be made clear by the fact that under Rule which provides for attachment of immoveable property persons are prohibited from taking any benefit under any transfer made after attachment In the case of a person who claims a title to the property either independently of the defendant in the suit or if from the defendant he asserts a title anterior to the institution of the suit in which the decree under execution was passed his claim is placed on a different basis by the legislature If such a person is in possession of the property the <ORG> executing the decree cannot dispossess him and his right to establish his title by a separate suit is expressly recognised By Rule an application to set aside a sale by depositing the purchase money may be made by any person owning the property or holding an interest in the property under a title acquired before sale and such an application would clearly be one between the judgment debtor or a person who has acquired his interest on the one hand and the decree holder and the purchaser under the decree on the other By Rule an application to set aside the sale on the ground of irregularity may be made by the decree holder or any person entitled to rateable distribution or a person whose interests are affected by the sale and to such an application the purchaser would clearly be a necessary party and questions arising under the application may have to be determined between him and the decree holder or the judgment debtor as the case may be The purchaser may himself apply to have the sale set aside on the ground that the judgment debtor had no saleable interest and only on questions raised under Rules or being decided in favour of the purchaser that the sale will be confirmed The purchaser can apply for the delivery of the property purchased by him as against the judgment debtor or against any person claiming under a title created by the judgment debtor subsequently to the attachment If the holder of a decree for possession of immoveable property or the purchaser of any such property sold in execution of a decree is obstructed in obtaining possession that is a matter to be investigated by the executing <ORG> If the resistance or obstruction is by the judgment debtor or by a transferee from him after the institution of the suit in which the decree was passed in that case the question is to be decided finally in execution On the other hand if the obstructor is a bonafide claimant claiming under a title independent of the judgment debtor then as already mentioned he would have a right to sue in spite of the decision in execution I think these provisions of the Code show that the legislature intended that all questions affecting a purchaser of the interest of the judgment debtor in property which is either affected by the decree or is sold under a decree are to be decided in execution between parties interested if the purchase was after the institution of the suit whether at a private sale or at a sale in execution of a money decree against the defendant I may here also refer to Section which says that Save as otherwise provided by this code or by any law for the time being in force where any proceeding may be taken or application made by or against any person then the proceeding may be taken or the application may be made by or against any person claiming under him It seems to me that the purchaser of property in execution of a decree may well be said to claim under the decree holder for the purposes of proceedings under Section in which his rights are affected I do not see how the case of a purchaser in execution of a decree can well be distinguished on principle On the other hand where the interest of the purchaser of property either in execution of the same decree or of another decree is affected by any question raised in execution by the holder of the decree under execution the purchaser is entitled to defend his interest as a person claiming under the judgment debtor As has been pointed out time after time by <ORG> as well as by <ORG> Section corresponding to the old Section should be interpreted in as liberal a spirit as the language would reasonably admit of It is a well known principle that a purchaser in a <ORG> sale represents the judgment debtor to the extent of the right title and interest as he had in the property purchased at the date of sale and represents the execution creditor in so far as he had a right to bring such right title and interest to sale in satisfaction of the decree This principle was laid down by <NAME> and <NAME> in holding that the purchaser was a party claiming under the execution creditor within the meaning of Section of the old Civil Procedure Code and there was thus privity of law between the two No doubt the learned judges with reference to some cases cited against that proposition dismissed them with the remark that they were cases under Section and not under Section but they were not considering any question under the former section Their Lordships in laying down the law in these terms observed that as the respondent was not represented before them they had examined the rulings of <ORG> for themselves and they also mention that Mr <NAME> who appeared for the appellant admitted before them that it was the common practice to make the auction purchaser a party to an application for setting aside an execution sale in that case the appellant wanted by a suit to have the judicial sale of the Zamindari set aside on the ground of fraud on the part of the decree holder and it was held that the question was determinable by virtue of Section only by an order of the <ORG> executing the decree and not by a separate suit No doubt their Lordships do not say that the auction purchaser would be a representative of either the judgment debtor or the decree holder within the meaning of Section but they clearly intended to lay down that as a party most interested in the result he would be entitled to be heard in any application under Section and that if the question was one of the character described therein i relating to the execution discharge or satisfaction of the decree then it must be determined by a proceeding under that section in which the auction purchaser must be joined In <NAME> and <NAME> I abovementioned it is observed that <ORG> could not have intended to delete the words arising between the parties to the suit in which the decree was passed or their representatives from Section But there seems to be no inconsistency if I may respectfully say so in holding that that the question was one arising between the parties although an auction purchaser who was most interested in the dispute was entitled and bound to ask for a decision by the court executing the decree The law therefore in my opinion is that a person who has bought the property of the defendant in a suit since the institution of that suit whether at a court auction held in execution of a money decree passed in another suit or by private purchase is entitled and bound to have any question relating to the execution discharge or satisfaction of the decree decided under Section by the court executing the decree when his interest is affected either by the decree itself or by the sale held in execution of that decree and the same rule applies to a purchaser of the property under such sale whether he is the decree holder himself or a stranger Whether the purchaser in the one case or the auction purchaser in the other is to be regarded as the representative of the judgment debtor or the decree holder depends upon the nature of the question raised and who the contesting party is In fact there was in that case as I understand it no attempt to decide whether he had one and if the judgment in <NAME> <NAME> I Bom The Committee regarded it as sufficient to attract the application of Section that a question relating to execution had arisen between the parties to the decree without reference to the purchaser inclusion in the proceedings In the cases before us the terms of the reference assume and it is evident that a question relating to the execution of the decree has arisen It is therefore unnecessary to answer the third question referred directly or otherwise than by saying that the inclusion of the auction purchaser as a party to proceedings relating to an auction sale does not make Section inapplicable to them It is not suggested that they can be regarded as the representatives of the holder of the decree under execution in the present proceedings since he had no connection with the <ORG> sale and private sale under which they claim It appeared it may be observed in the course of argument that the statement of the parties characters in my order of reference was inaccurate in as much as in all these appeals and not only in Appeal Against Order No the contesting party was the vendee of the decree holder purchaser under the money decree It does not seem to me that any detailed discussion of the numerous decisions enumerated in the judgment just delivered is called for since the conflict between them is for the most part beyond reconciliation On two points however there is a distinct preponderance of authority in this <ORG> and I therefore take it as settled law that the representative mentioned in Section is not to be identified with a legal representative as defined in Section and that a purchaser at <ORG> auction represents some one i either the judgment debtor or the decree holder As regards money decrees it seems to me very difficult if not impossible to imagine a case in which the purchaser can become the representative of the decree holder the question arose regarding a purchaser from the decree holder purchaser at the <ORG> sale and in that case and <NAME> <NAME> the <ORG> sale was held under the decree in the execution of which the application of Section was proposed On the other hand as the learned Chief Justice has shown the purchaser at a <ORG> sale has been regarded so far as appears on general grounds as the representative of the judgment debtor in <NAME> <NAME> I Mad When it does it seems to me that his character as decree holder in one execution can have no effect on his position in another and that there is nothing in authority or on principle to debar us from treating him like any other stranger to the latter no reason appearing for according him any other rights than a stranger purchaser from the judgment debtor whether by execution or private sale would acquire The foregoing entails that the purchaser from a decree holder purchaser under a money decree is the representative of the judgment debtor for the purpose of enquiry into a question relating to the execution of a distinct decree affecting the same property I would answer the second question referred accordingly One <NAME> sued him in No of and obtained a money decree on the th of January They were sold on the th of October of the same year purchased by the decree holder and the sale was confirmed on the th of November He obtained a preliminary decree on the th of September The lower Court held that the purchase under the money decree was affected by the doctrine of lis pendens as the sale was subsequent to the institution of the mortgage suit The present appeals are by the representatives of the purchaser under the money decree against the order of <ORG> directing possession to be given to the purchasers under the mortgage decree It was under these circumstances the three questions have been referred for the opinion of <ORG> Upon one question there was no contest It was conceded by the counsel for the respondent that where the equity of redemption is purchased under a money decree in matters relating to execution of a mortgage decree the auction purchaser under the money decree will be the representative of the judgment debtor in the mortgage decree Although the point was not expressly decided by the Board I respectfully concur with the view taken in Calcutta that that decision is authority for the proposition enunciated But having regard to the decisions of <ORG> and of the two <ORG> cases referred to by me I am of opinion that the auction purchaser represents the judgment debtor in questions relating to the execution of decree in the second suit on the mortgage On principle it seems to me that this latter view is wrong The only provision in the Code of Civil Procedure which affects the decree holder is that which provides for an application by the auction purchaser for a refund of the money from the decree holder in case the sale is set aside In that case a suit was brought by a judgment debtor for setting aside the sale of his property on the ground that the decree holder acted fraudulently The auction purchaser at the execution sale was made a defendant <NAME> who appeared for the appellants admitted that the question at issue was one relating to execution discharge or satisfaction of the decree But he argued with much ingenuity that the suit was not barred by the provisions of Section because the question concerned the auction purchasers as much as anybody the italics are mine and therefore as he contended it could not properly be described as a question arising between the parties to the suit in which the decree was passed This statement shows that what the courts have to see is whether the issues arising for decision relate a to execution to deciding rival rights of the decree holder and of the judgment debtor in the subject matter If those conditions are satisfied the fact that others are interested in the result of the decision should not affect the jurisdiction and competency of the executing court to deal with the matter Their Lordships lay special emphasis on the cheapness and speediness of remedies expected of an application in execution If we turn to the language of Section which corresponds to Section of the Code of the same result would appear to follow The section lays down only two conditions which have been insisted on by <ORG> I am therefore of opinion that as extended an application should be given to the rule enunciated by <ORG> as is consistent with the language of Section there are observations of Sir <NAME> which may be regarded as enunciating the same principle The rule itself is so eminently a workable one and steers clear of many difficulties which have sprung round the application of Section that in my opinion both the letter of the law and the reason of it demand that this principle should be given wide effect by <ORG> in this country I would therefore answer all the questions referred to us by saying that if the points for decision in an application before the executing <ORG> relate to the rival rights of the decree holder and of the judgment debtor and also relate to execution discharge or satisfaction of the decree it should be dealt with in execution and not by separate suit
