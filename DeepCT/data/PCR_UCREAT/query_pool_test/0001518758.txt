He purchased bags of vegetables on in a village known as Ayyapareddipalem and loaded the same in a trailer of a tractor bearing No MH He was immediately shifted to Peddapadu where he breathed his last A claim petition was filed by the respondents herein before <ORG> Nellore claiming a sum of Rs The Appellant herein denied and disputed its liability to pay any amount to the Respondents by way of compensation inter alia on the ground that the deceased was traveling in the said tractor as a paid passenger <ORG> by reason of the impugned judgment has dismissed the appeal preferred by the Appellant herein from the said judgment and award holding that as the deceased was traveling in the trailer alongwith his goods being vegetables it was liable to pay compensation Mr <NAME> learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant would submit that as this Court in <ORG> Vs <NAME> and Others SCC overruled its earlier decision in <ORG> Vs <NAME> SCC holding that the insurance company would not be liable for paying compensation to a passenger in a goods vehicle whether he was travelling as an owner of the goods when that vehicle meets with an accident the impugned judgment is not sustainable Mrs <NAME> learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents on the other hand would submit that a tractor is not a goods carriage vehicle and as carrying of vegetables in a tractor would be for agricultural purpose the appellant cannot be absolved from its liability to pay the amount of compensation In the year Section was amended by reason of Act of with effect from in terms whereof the words including owner of the goods or his authorized representative carried in the vehicle were added after the words against any liability which may be incurred by him in respect of the death of or bodily injury to any person On an erroneous impression this Court came to the conclusion that the insurer would be liable to pay compensation in respect of the death or bodily injury caused to either the owner of the goods or his authorised representative when being carried in a goods vehicle the accident occurred In view of the changes in the relevant provisions in the Act vis a vis the Act we are of the opinion that the meaning of the words any person must also be attributed having regard to the context in which they have been used i a third party Furthermore sub clause i of clause of sub section of section speaks of liability which may be incurred by the owner of a vehicle in respect of death of or bodily injury to any person or damage to any property of a third party caused by or arising out of the use of the vehicle in a public place whereas sub clause ii thereof deals with liability which may be incurred by the owner of a vehicle against the death of or bodily injury to any passenger of a public service vehicle caused by or arising out of the use of the vehicle in a public place We may consider the matter from another angle Section of the Act enables the insurers to raise defences against the claim of the claimants In terms of clause of sub section of section of the Act one of the defences which is available to the insurer is that the vehicle in question has been used for a purpose not allowed by the permit under which the vehicle was used There is no provision similar to clause ii of the proviso appended to section of the old Act prescribing requirement of insurance policy There is no reference to any passenger in goods carriage In Asha Rani supra it has been noticed that sub clause i of clause of sub section of Section of the Act speaks of liability which may be incurred by the owner of a vehicle in respect of death of or bodily injury to any person or damage to any property of a third party caused by or arising out of the use of the vehicle in a public place It is therefore manifest that in spite of the amendment of the effect of the provision contained in Section with respect to persons other than the owner of the goods or his authorized representative remains the same Emphasis supplied An insurance for an owner of the goods or his authorized representative travelling in a vehicle became compulsory only with effect from i from the date of coming into force of Amending Act of The goods carriage has been defined in Section to mean any motor vehicle constructed or adapted for use solely for the carriage of goods or any motor vehicle not so constructed or adapted when used for the carriage of goods whereas tractor has been defined in Section to mean a motor vehicle which is not itself constructed to carry any load other than equipment used for the purpose of propulsion but excludes a road roller It may be as has been contended by Mrs <NAME> that carriage of vegetables being agricultural produce would lead to an inference that the tractor was being used for agricultural purposes but the same by itself would not be construed to mean that the tractor and trailer can be used for carriage of goods by another person for his business activities However even if it be assumed that the trailer would answer the description of the goods carriage as contained in Section of the Motor Vehicles Act the case would be covered by the decisions of this Court in Asha Rani supra and other decisions following the same as the accident had taken place on i much prior to coming into force of amendment
