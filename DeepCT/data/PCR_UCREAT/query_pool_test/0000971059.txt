been registered in respect of each of the respondent companies under section of the Act by <ORG> the BIFR in short and the matters were adjourned on more than one occasions awaiting further steps to be taken in view of section of the Act As a common question as to the effect of section of the Act is involved I have heard several counsel for the petitioners and also counsel for the respondent companies who have appeared They have also addressed arguments on the action to be taken by the court in the event section is held applicable The points that arise for consideration are a Whether the mere proof of a reference being registered by the <ORG> under section of the Act attracts the provisions of section If section is held applicable its effect on these company petitions The Act has received the assent of the President on January and some of its Provisions were enforced from January and others from May Its section contains a declaration and it is for giving effect to the <ORG> towards securing the directive principles specified in article and of the Constitution According to the Objects and Reasons A need has therefor been felt to enact in public interest a legislation to provide for timely detection of sickness in industrial companies and for expeditious determination by a body of experts of the preventive ameliorative remedial and other measures that would need to be adopted with respect to such companies and for enforcement of the measures considered appropriate with utmost practicable despatch Section gives overriding to the Act on other laws as mentioned in it Section bars the jurisdiction of civil courts in respect of any matter which <ORG> is empowered to decide under the Act Section saves certain proceedings mentioned in it Section confers power on <ORG>

certain statutory functions Section of the Act defines a sick industrial company Chapter III which comprises sections to provides for references of cases to be dealt with under the Act inquiry and the measures that may be taken by <ORG> in respect of sick industrial companies Section casts an obligation on the management of an industrial company which has become a sick industrial undertaking to make a reference to the <ORG> for appropriate action Under section of the Act the <ORG> may make such inquiry as it deems fit for determining whether any industrial company has become a sick industrial company such an inquiry may be taken up either on receipt of a reference under section or upon information received with respect to such company or upon its own knowledge Sections to provide for various measures the <ORG> may adopt to revive rehabilitate reconstruct or take steps for winding up a sick industrial company in the circumstances mentioned in the said provisions Sub section enables the <ORG> to pass certain orders which may suspend the operation of the contracts etc Sub section gives overriding effect to the passed by the <ORG> under subsection and sub section provides for suspension of period of limitation for enforcement of any right or privilege during which its remedy for enforcement was suspended under this section The <ORG> may make such inquiry as it may deem fit for determining whether any industrial company has become a sick industrial company a upon receipt of a reference with respect with to such company under section or upon information received with respect to such company or upon its own knowledge as to the financial condition of the company The board may if it deems necessary or expedient so to do for the expeditious disposal of an inquiry under sub section require by order any operating agency to inquire into and make a report with respect to such matters as may be specified in the order The <ORG> or as the case may be the operating agency shall complete its inquiry as expeditiously as possible and endeavour shall be made to complete the inquiry within days from the commencement of the inquiry Where the Board deems it fit to make an inquiry or to cause an inquiry or to cause an inquiry to be made into any industrial company under sub section or as the case may be under sub section it shall appoint one of more persons to be a special director or special directors of the company for safeguarding the financial and other interests of the company Where in respect of an industrial company an inquiry under section is pending or any scheme referred to under section is under preparation or consideration or a sanctioned scheme is under implementation or where an appeal under section relating to an industrial company pending then notwithstanding anything contained in the companies Act or any other law or the memorandum and articles of association of the industrial company or any other instruments having effect under the said Act or other law no proceedings for the winding up of the industrial company or for the execution distress or the like against any of the properties of the industrial company or for the appointment of a receiver in receiver in respect there of shall lie or be proceeded with further except with the consent of the <ORG> or as the case may be the appellate authority Where a receiver or an official liquidator has been appointed in any proceeding pending immediately before the commencement of this Act in any <ORG> for winding up of an industrial company such proceeding shall not abate but continue in the that <ORG> However if there is a controversy as to whether the industrial company has become sick within the meaning of section the <ORG> may conduct an inquiry on that aspect keeping in view the provisions of other subsections of section The main objects of an inquiry under section is to determine whether the provisions of section apply and therefore it is a sick company with a view to take measures under section is to determine whether the provisions of section apply and therefore it is a sick company with a view to take measures under sections to Point a The commencement of an inquiry under section a will be either consequent on a reference made by the sick industrial company itself or a financial institution named in section The question whether an industrial company is sick company or not has to be determined with reference to the criteria laid down in the definition under section which is to be generally on the basis of documents available with the Register of companies financial institutions or the company itself Apparently in a reference under section and there is no dispute about the applicability of section and therefore the secretary or the Registrar has been given the authority to take action for registration under section a However in cases where the company itself disputes the applicability of section to it and <ORG> on the basis of information has reason to believe that it is applicable an inquiry into that aspect become necessary as contemplated by section and certain provisions to help a speedy after the inquiry if it is found that section applies the <ORG> has to take one of the alternative measures contemplated by sections to <NAME> <NAME> learned counsel appearing for one of the petitioners contended that the mere registration of a reference under section will not make section applicable or be a ground for stopping the winding up proceedings in this court It is contended that unless an inquiry contemplated by any the sub sections to has commenced section does not become applicable In view of the various provisions noticed above the inquiry contemplated by section will commence either on the receipt of a reference under section or or on the basis of any other information received by <ORG> In the case of references the secretary is empowered to hold a preliminary inquiry and register it and thereafter the Board will make such inquiry as it considers necessary in with the alternative measures to be adopted under sections to Where there is no reference and the <ORG> chooses to commence an inquiry naturally there will be a contest by the company itself and in such cases the <ORG> will conduct an inquiry keeping in view the provisions of the other sub section If the <ORG> comes to the conclusion that section applies to the company in respect of which the inquiry is being held it will then consider one of the alternative measures under sections to In view of the scheme of the Act the jurisdiction of the court under the Companies Act is excluded by implication The jurisdiction of the civil court is however excluded by section Therefore the registration of a referenced by the <ORG> for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction may be by the Secretary under the powers conferred on him is prima facie proof that the inquiry before the <ORG> is pending and the <ORG> has to take further steps for taking one of the alternative measures under section to It was contended by several counsel for the petitioners that the matters should be adjourned from time to time awaiting the further progress before <ORG> After it is determined that section applies to a company broadly three alternatives are possible under sections to viz a measures to revive a company where its net worth can be increased framing a scheme and taking steps for winding up The <ORG> is given wide powers and the petitioners can be certainly approach the <ORG> for relief during this stage Till the <ORG> passes an order under section there is no restraint against the companies in alienating their properties and probably the petitioners may be able to move the <ORG> if considered necessary I therefore consider it appropriate to pass the following order a The management of respondent i shall once in every six months viz on first January and first July of every calendar year inform the respective petitioners and their counsel at the address shown in the company petition or to any other changed address which may be intimated the progress of the case before <ORG> by registered post ii shall not alienate the assets without leave of <ORG> for a period of six months The winding up petitions are closed with liberty to the petitioners to make an application for reviving them in the event it becomes permissible by virtue of any subsequent of <ORG>
