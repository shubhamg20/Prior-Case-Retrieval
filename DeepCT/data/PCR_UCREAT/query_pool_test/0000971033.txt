Part First Schedule Whether tax can exceed taxable income Finance Act Nature and scope of Whether can impose fresh charge Harshness of a taxing statute if a ground for challenge Business income of a cooperative society doing banking Whether additional surcharge a tax Whether additional surcharge Can be levied on income exempted from payment of tax HEADNOTE The appellant is <ORG> engaged in the business of banking According to section i a of the Income Tax Act <ORG> engaged in the business of banking is not liable to pay income tax on its business income The tax amounting to Rs Applying the Finance Act of the residual income of the appellant was computed at Rs Thus the total tax imposed on the appellant came to Rs The relevant provisions of the Finance Act were challenged as invalid on the ground that i they imposed additional surcharge on income which was exempt from tax under the provisions of the Income Tax Act and that ii the additional surcharge was intended as additional levy on the income tax and had no independent existence apart from it <ORG> rejected these contentions It assumes what has to be examined that no part of the income exempted from Income Tax and Super Tax under the Income Tax Act can be brought to tax by a Finance Act The concession of the counsel for the appellant giving up challenge to the power of the Constitution <ORG> has the exclusive power to make laws with respect any of the matters in List of the Seventh Schedule Entry in List I relates to tax on income other than agricultural income The Income Tax Act and the annual Finance Act are enacted by the <ORG> in exercise of the powers conferred by Art read with entry of List I Once the <ORG> has the legislative competence to enact a law with respect to certain subject matter the limits of that competence cannot be judged further by the form or manner in which that power is exercised Therefore what is not income under the Income Tax Act can be made income by the Finance Act There the essential point for determination was whether surcharge is additional mode or rate for charging income tax The additional surcharge though levied by the Finance Act independently of the Income Tax Act is but a mode of levying tax on a portion of the assessee income computed in accordance with the definition in section of the Finance Act Under section read with section of the Income tax Act income tax is not payable by the appellant Similarly super tax is not payable under section i read with section The primary purpose of the annual Finance Act as envisaged by section of the Income tax Act is to prescribe the rates of income tax on the total income of an assessee and this function as contemplated by section is to be subject to the other provisions of this Act namely the Income tax Act which would include inter alia section The history of Indian income tax shows that surcharges by way of increase to the amount of income tax which are added to the basic amount in view of article of the Constitution of India are nothing other than income tax and a part of income tax alone The main part of section a says that Income tax shall be charged at the rates specified in Part I of the First Schedule and clause ii of that section provides in the ease referred to therein that income tax shall further be increased by an additional surcharge for the purpose of the <ORG> calculated in the manner provided in the First Schedule Section of the Finance Act also applies to a stage of computation only and in regard to relief rebate etc It does not impose any liability or any tax Section of the Finance Act defining residual income which requires deduction from the total income of income tax surcharge and special surcharge to ascertain residual income also does not have the effect of imposing any liability or any tax but merely provides for computation There is no room for any intendment There is no equity about a tax There is no presumption as to tax The court will be very slow in reading an implied amendment in a tax law because there is no intendment The to are inclusive for the purpose of imposing tax but they are not one levy only The appellant filed a writ petition in <ORG> under Article of the Constitution to challenge an assessment order dated August made by the respondent levying additional surcharge on its residual income <ORG> dismissed the writ petition by its judgment dated October IS but it has granted to the appellant a certificate to file an appeal to this Court under Articles a and of the Constitution The appellant is a co operative society engaged in the business of banking Its total income for the assessment year was computed by the respondent at Rs Since under section i a of the Income tax Act a co operative society engaged in the business of banking is not liable to pay income tax on its business income the tax amounting to Rs Thus the total tax levied on the appellant came to Rs Section of the Income tax Act was deleted by the Finance Act XX of with effect from April but its provisions were incorporated by the same Finance Act in section Income tax shall not be payable by a co operative society i in respect of the profits and gains of business carried on by it if it is a a society engaged in carrying on the business of banking or providing credit facilities to its members It is indisputable that by reason of this provision the tanking income of the appellant amounting to Rs Section a of the Finance Act provides that Income tax and super tax Subject to the provisions of sub section and for the assessment year commencing on the st day of April a income tax shall be charged at the rates specified in Part I of the First Schedule and i in the cases to which paragraphs A and of that Part apply shall be increased by a surcharge for purposes of the Union and except in the cases to which the said paragraph applies a special surcharge calculated in either case in the manner provided therein and ii in the cases to which paragraphs A and of the aforesaid Part apply shall further be increased by an additional surcharge for purposes of the <ORG> hereinafter referred to as additional surcharge calculated in the manner provided in the said Schedule Section provides that For the purposes of paragraphs A and of Part I of the First Schedule the expression residual income means the amount of the total income as reduced by a the amount of the capital gains if any included therein and the amount of tax exclusive of additional surcharge which would have been chargeable on such reduced total income if it had been the total income no part of which had been exempt from tax and on no portion of which deduction of tax had been admissible under any provisions of the Income tax Act or this Act Section provides that Notwithstanding anything contained in the provisions of Chapter VII or Chapter VIII A or section of the Income tax Act or sub section of section of this Act in calculating any relief rebate or deduction in respect of income tax payable on the total income of an assessee which includes any income on which no income tax is payable or in respect of which a deduction of income tax is admissible under any of the aforesaid provisions no account shall be taken of the additional surcharge Clause provides for the levy of a special surcharge Clause with which we are concerned provides for the levy of an additional surcharge for the purposes of the <ORG> calculated on the amount of the residual income at the rates mentioned therein It assumes what has to be examined that no part of the income exempted from income tax and super tax under the Income tax Act can be brought to tax by a Finance Act The total income of the appellant was computed at Rs By reason of sections i a and of the Income tax Act the appellant enjoys an exemption from income tax and super tax in respect of its business income which amounts to Rs Thus on the assumption that the Finance Act validly and on a true interpretation imposes the additional surcharge on residual income the tax imposed on the appellant is Rs By Article of the Constitution <ORG> has the exclusive power to make laws with respect to any of the matters in List I of the Seventh Schedule Entry in List I relates to taxes on income other than agricultural income The Income tax Act and the annual Finance Act are enacted by the <ORG> in exercise of the power conferred by Article read with Entry of List I Once the <ORG> has the legislative competence to enact a law with respect to a certain subject matter the limits of that competence cannot be judged further by the form or manner in which that power is exercised If the <ORG> has the legislative competence to introduce a new charge of tax it may exercise that power either by incorporating that charge in the Income tax Act or by introducing it in the Finance Act or for the matter of that in any other Statute Therefore what is not income under the Income tax Act can be made income by a Finance Act an exemption granted by the Income tax Act can be withdrawn by the Finance Act or the efficacy of that exemption may be reduced by the imposition of a new charge an assessee challenged the scheme of Annuity Deposits of the ground that the <ORG> has no competence to incorporate ill the Income tax Act a provision which was substantially one relating to borrowings by <ORG> from a class of tax payers The challenge was repelled by this Court on the ground that if the parliament had the legislative competence to pass an Act for collecting Annuity Deposits from tax payers nothing contained in the Constitution disentitled it as a matter of legislative arrangement to incorporate the provisions relating to borrowing from tax payers in the Income tax Act or any other statute We will now proceed to consider the provisions of the Finance Act under which the respondent has levied additional surcharge on the appellant residual income To put it differently the argument is that the exemption granted by section i a extends to surcharges also as a result whereof a co operative society engaged in the business of banking is neither liable to pay income tax nor any of the surcharges on its business income After considering the report of <ORG> the provisions of the Government of India Act the provisions of Articles and of the Constitution and the various Finance Act this Court held differing from <ORG> that the word income tax in section of the Finance Act includes surcharges and the additional surcharge Section a of the Finance Act did not by itself refer to any surcharge but it provided that in making the assessment for the assessment year commencing on April the income tax payable by the assessee on his salary income shall be an amount bearing to the total amount of income tax payable according to the rates applicable under the operation of the Finance Act on his total income the same proportion as the salary income bears the total income The question which arose for consideration was under the total income The question which arose for consideration was whether the words income tax payable according to the rates applicable under the operation of the Finance Act included surcharges which were leviable under the Act of The question was answered by this Court in the affirmative As the judgment shows the essential point for determination was whether surcharge is an additional mode or rate for charging income tax The question before us is whether even if the surcharger is but an additional mode or rate for charging income tax the Finance Act of authorises by its terms the levy of additional surcharge on income which is exempt from income tax under the Income tax Act In <NAME> case the Court declined to express any opinion on the distinction made by <ORG> that surcharges are levied under the Finance Act while income tax was levied under the Income tax Act What we have to determine is whether the Act of provides for the levy of additional surcharge Granting that the word income tax includes surcharges it may be arguable that the exemption from the payment of income tax under section i a of the Act would extend to surcharges If while legislating on a matter within its competence the <ORG> can grant an exemption it is surely competent to it to withdraw that exemption in exercise of the self same power Such innovations fall within the legitimate scope of Finance Act Section of the Indian Finance Act made in the amount of excess profits tax repaid under section of the Finance Act income for the purpose of the Indian Income tax Act and further provided that income shall be treated for purposes of assessment to income tax and super tax as the income of the previous year We are unable to accept this contention Article of the Constitution provides that the duties and taxes mentioned therein shall be levied and collected by <ORG> but shall be assigned to the States in the manner provided in clause Article provides that Taxes on income other than agricultural income shall be levied and collected by <ORG> and distributed between the <ORG> and the States in the manner provided in clause By Article notwithstanding anything in Articles and <ORG> may increase any of the duties or taxes referred to in those Articles by a surcharge for purposes of the <ORG> Section a ii of that Act provides in so far as relevant that for the assessment year commencing on April income tax shall be charged at the rates specified in Part I of First Schedule and in cases to which Paragraph A of Part I applies the income tax shall further be increased by an additional surcharge for purposes of the <ORG> calculated in the manner provided in the First Schedule taxes and duties mentioned in Article though levied and collected by the <ORG> have to be assigned to the States in the manner provided in clause of that Article Then again the additional surcharge levied for purposes of the <ORG> is to be calculated not on total income like the income tax but it is to be calculated on the residual income Section of the Act of defines residual income as total income reduced by a capital gains if any included in that total income and the amount of tax exclusive of additional surcharge which would have been chargeable on such reduced total income if it had been the total income no part of which had been exempt from tax and on no portion of which deduction of tax had been admissible In order that the exemption granted to co operative banks by section i a may not lose its meaning and content section of the Finance Act introduces the concept of residual income on which alone the additional surcharge is payable For ascertaining the residual income the total income is reduced by the amount of capital gains and further by the amount of tax other than additional surcharge which would have been charged on such reduced total income on the assumption that the whole of it was liable to be brought to tax It is levied on the residual income of Rs which is arrived at after deducting Gross taxes exclusive of additional surcharge amounting to Rs By section of the Finance Act of no account can be taken of the additional surcharge in calculating any relief rebate or deduction in respect of income tax payable on the total income of an assessee which includes any income on which no income tax is payable or in respect of which a deduction of income tax is admissible That section uses the language that income tax shall further be increased by an additional sur charge not for making the assessability to surcharge dependent upon Assessability to income tax but for the simple reason that if an assessee total income includes income on which no tax is payable tax has all the same to be computed for purposes of rate Section of the Income tax Act provides that where there is included in the total income of an assessee any income on which no income tax is payable the assessee shall be entitled to deduction from the amount of income tax with which he is chargeable on his total income of an amount equal to the income tax calculated at the average rate of income tax on the amount on which no income tax is payable If the intention was to limit the liability to pay additional surcharge to income which can be brought to income tax appropriate language could have been used to convey that simple sense This is so not because additional surcharge is payable by law on non business income but because it is payable on residual income and residual income by definition includes non business income as reduced In fact it consists of the amount of total income as reduced by the amounts mentioned in clauses a and of section This partly is the same argument in a different disguise that an assessee who is not liable to pay income tax cannot be made liable to pay additional surcharge under the Finance Act We have rejected that contention Partly the argument is designed to establish correlation with section of the income tax Act by which when any tax interest penalty fine or any other sum is payable in consequence of any order passed under the Act <ORG> office has to serve upon the assessee a notice of demand in the prescribed form specifying the sum so payable The interpretation put by us on the Finance Act does no violence to section of the Income tax Act under which income tax at the rates prescribed by the Finance Act is to be charged in accordance with and subject to the provisions of The learned Judges were in error in holding that section of the Finance Act does not provide for the levy of a tax other than income tax and that therefore additional surcharge is not payable to the extent of the income which is exempt under section of the Income tax Act One of the difficulties which the learned Judges felt in accepting the revenue contention was that if the additional surcharge mentioned in the Finance Act of was not partake of the nature of income tax it will not be possible to demand and realise it under the provisions of the income tax Act and the notice of demand and recovery proceedings would be vitiated on that account It is a tax on residual income and by reason of the definition contained in section of the Act of residual income would include non business income which under the Income tax Act is charge able to income tax Thus the additional surcharge though levied by the Finance Act independently of the Income tax Act is but a mode of levying tax on a portion of the assessee income computed in accordance with the definition in section of the Act of Therefore the notice of demand under section of the Income tax Act can lawfully call for the payment of amount due from an assessee by way of additional surcharge For these reasons we confirm the judgment of <ORG> but in the circumstances there will be no order as to costs
