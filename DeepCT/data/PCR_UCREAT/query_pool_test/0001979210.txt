RAJENDRA BABU The first respondent which is <ORG> filed a complaint against the appellant for unfair labour practices under Section of the Maharashtra Recognition of Trade Unions Prevention of Unfair Labour Practices Act for short the Act under Item a by way of victimisation not in good faith but in the colourable exercise of the employers right for patently false reasons and in utter disregard of the principles of natural justice in the conduct of domestic enquiry or with undue haste of Scheduled IV of the Act Before <ORG> at Bombay it was claimed by the respondent herein that the statutory duty of the appellant is not only to keep the factory premises clean hygienic and dust free but also the surroundings thereof in terms of Schedule of Drugs Cosmetics Act and the employees engaged for such process are therefore employees of the company itself that in fact the appellant had been directly employing the workmen to attend such work and the appellant used to appoint such persons on casual or temporary basis and terminate their services from time to time with a view to depriving them of the permanent status and wages and other benefits as applicable to permanent workmen of the appellant that this situation continued till the year when such casual or temporary workmen engaged in cleaning process joined the respondent Union in order to protect their rights for permanency in the appellant company that since about the appellant has been engaging persons but on paper they are shown as contract workmen working for contractor respondent No herein that the second respondent is only a name lender whereas the appellant is the real employer of the workmen that the appellant through the second respondent terminated the services of such workmen employed through second respondent the moment the persons completed months of services thereby depriving them of the status of permanent workmen that the entire effort being made to avoid giving permanency to the workmen concerned with sanitation sweeping and in keeping the factory premises and surrounding thereof in a hygienic condition It is further alleged that there are about such workmen who were engaged in such activities that in keeping with the past practice the respondent had reasons to apprehend that the moment any of the workmen completes months of service the services of such employee would be terminated It is submitted on behalf of the respondent that the recruitment of such workmen is done by the appellant and upon selection such workmen are sent to appellants doctor for medical check up They claimed that they are the workmen working under the direct supervision control and direction of the officers of the appellant who assign work to them and they are granted leave by the officers of the appellant and are also paid by the appellant that the company is the real employer apart from being the employees because of statutory obligation of the company to employ such workmen that however the appellant denied the relationship of employer employee from various stages that such denial of relationship is only to deprive the workmen of permanency in the company and payment of wages as are applicable to the permanent workmen of the company that the company has denied this relationship as employer and thus this cause of action has arisen in this complaint that the appellant has engaged in unfair labour practices in terms of Act and it be directed to cease and desist from continuing to do so The appellant apart from denying that it is guilty of unfair labour practices under Items a and of Scheduled IV of the Act contended that the persons listed in Exhibit A and referred to in the complaint are not the employees of the company nor are they employed ostensibly through the second respondent The appellant categorically denied that they are the employees of the company and there has never been any employer employee relationship between them and therefore the question of terminating the services of the employees employed by the second respondent would not arise The appellant contended that since it is engaged in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products for which a high degree of cleanliness and hygiene is required to be maintained and therefore it is necessary for the company to seek the services of the specialised agencies and this practice has been in vogue for several years and in the last eight year such services have been obtained from three different agency and they are i <ORG> ii <ORG> and iii <ORG> The second respondent had been engaged as an agency for rendering house keeping and hygiene services and the terms of the engagement were set out in a letter dated Pursuant to such rendering of services the second respondent had engaged services of the persons named in Exhibit A The appellant contended that the named persons in the Exhibit A to the complaint are those who have joined the second respondent only during the last to months The appellant denied that it interviewed and selected the persons to be employed by the second respondent but it was expected that persons employed by the second respondent were subjected to periodical medical examination in order to comply with the statutory requirements for maintaining proper hygiene integrity of the manufacturing processes of the company It is also denied by the appellant that the workmen are working under the direct control and supervision of the officers of the company and there is any employer employee relationship between them It was submitted that the second respondent pays wages to those employees in accordance with or more than the minimum wages It is also contended that the appellant has obtained registration as required under the earlier Act and the copy of which was produced in the proceedings Does he prove that he is entitled the relief as prayed for Whether this <ORG> has jurisdiction to entertain the complaint <ORG> after elaborate consideration of the pleadings and evidence on record came to the following JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ conclusion JJJJJJJJJJJ It can be seen from the evidence on record and the documents filed by the parties that different contractors engaged by the first respondent company and these workmen had never worked in the first respondent company but they had worked through second respondent The second respondent has also obtained licence No under the provisions of Contract Labour Regulation Abolition Act which is at Exh It is also independently and separately registered under the provisions of Employees Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act From these documents it is crystal clear that it is a separate entity and there is a contract between the first respondent and second respondent in respect of sweeping and cleaning in the company premises After further examination it was held that the arrangement between the appellant and the second respondent can only be termed as legal and bona fide and hence the matter of abolition of contract labour in the process of house keeping and maintenance of the premises of the factory can be agitated only under the provisions of Contract Labour Regulation and Abolition Act In the writ petition <ORG> of <ORG> took a different view of the matter and allowed the complaint In that case the complaint of the <ORG> was that workmen who were working in one of the canteens of the respondent company were not given the service conditions as were available to the other workmen of the company and there was also a threat of termination of their services This Court proceeded to consider the case on the basis that their complaint was that the workmen were the employees of the company and therefore the breach committed and the threats of retrenchment were cognizable by <ORG> or <ORG> under the Act Even in the complaint no case was made out that the workmen had ever been accepted by the company as its employees On the other hand the complaint proceeded on the basis as if the workmen were a part of the work force of the company This Court noticed that the workmen were never recognised by the company as its workmen and it was the consistent contention of the company that they were not its employees In that case it was the admitted position that the workmen were employed by a contractor who was given a contract to run the canteen in question SCC wherein it was noticed that the first question to be decided would be whether an industrial dispute could be raised for abolition of the contract labour system in view of the provisions of the Act and if so who can do so supra would make it clear that such a question can be gone into and that the observations would not mean that the workmen had to establish by some other proceedings before the complaint is filed or that if the complaint is filed the moment the employer repudiates or denies the relationship of employer and employees the court will not have any jurisdiction The observation of this Court that it is open to the workmen to raise an appropriate industrial dispute in that behalf if they are entitled to do so has to be understood in the light of the observations of this Court made earlier On that basis <ORG> proceeded to further consider the matter and reversed the findings recorded by the two courts and gave a finding that the workmen in question are the workmen of the appellant company The industrial tribunal had adjudicated the matter and held that the workmen concerned in the reference could not be the workmen of the contractors and therefore all the workmen employed by the contractor should be deemed to be the workmen of the <ORG> The industrial tribunal also gave consequential directions to the <ORG> for payment of wages etc The contention put forth before this Court was that after coming into force of the Act it is only the appropriate Government which can abolish the contact labour system after consulting the Central <ORG> or the State <ORG> as the case may be and no other authority including the industrial tribunal has jurisdiction either to entertain such dispute or to direct abolition of the contract labour system and neither the appropriate Government nor the industrial tribunal has the power to direct that the workmen of the erstwhile contractor should be deemed to be the workmen of the <ORG> contract covered by But one thing is clear if the employees are working under a the Contract Labour Regulation Abolition Act then it is clear that the labour court or the industrial adjudicating authorities cannot have any jurisdiction to deal with the matter as it falls within the province of an appropriate Government to abolish the same The respondent union came to <ORG> with a complaint that the workmen are engaged by the appellant through the contractor and though that is ostensible relationship the true relationship is one of master and servant between the appellant and the workmen in question That exercise of repudiation of the contract with one and establishment of a legal relationship with another can be done only in a regular industrial tribunal court under the I Act <NAME> the learned senior Advocate appearing for the respondent submitted that under Section of the Act the labour court has the power to decide all matters arising out of any application or complaint referred to it for the decision under any of the provisions of the Act If under other provisions of the Act the industrial tribunal or the labour court has no jurisdiction to deal with a particular aspect of the matter Section does not give such power to it In the cases at hand before us whether a workmen can be stated to be the workman of the appellant establishment or not it must be held that the contract between the appellant and the second respondent is a camouflage or bogus and upon such a decision it can be held that the workman in question is an employee of the appellant establishment In cases of this nature where the provisions of the Act are summary in nature and give drastic remedies to the parties concerned elaborate consideration of the question as to relationship of employer employee cannot be gone into If at any time the employee concerned was indisputably an employee of the establishment and subsequently it is so disputed such a question is an incidental question arising under Section of the Act In determining whether the wages had been appropriately paid or not the authority under the Payment of Wages Act was held to have jurisdiction to decide the incidental question of whether the applicant was in the employment of the railway administration during the relevant period It means that at one time or the other the concerned employee was indisputably in employment and later on he was found to be not so employed and in those circumstances the court stated that it was an incidental question to be considered <ORG> Next decision relied upon by <NAME> is <ORG> SCR to contend that even in cases arising under Section of the Industrial Disputes Act the scope though very limited certain incidental questions can be gone into like a claim for special allowance for operating adding machine which may not be based on the Sastry Award made under the provisions of Chapter A Therefore we are afraid that the contention advanced very ably by <NAME> on behalf of the respondents cannot be accepted The correct interpretation of these decisions will lead to the result which we have stated in the course of this order In the view we have taken on the question of jurisdiction of <ORG> under the Act the decision given by <ORG> on other questions need not be considered In the circumstances we allow this appeal set aside the order of <ORG> and restore that of the industrial court affirming the order of the labour court
