HEADNOTE The assessee company which derived its income from the manufacture and sale of sugar and confectionery was as sessed for the years by the Income Tax Officer under the Income Tax Act by making additions of Rs for cane cost Rs for shortage in cane and Rs for salary of outstation staff Later in the year the Income Tax Officer issued notice under read with of the Income Tax Act in respect of the assessment year for imposing penalty Before the Inspecting Assistant Commissioner the assessee admitted that these amounts which were not included in the return by the compa ny represented income On finding that there was deliberate understatement of income he imposed a penalty of Rs On appeal the <ORG> held that the mere fact that the amounts were agreed to be taken into account by the assessee did not ipsofacto indicate any criminality in its action to conceal any portion of the income and that the assessee could very well have argued against the additions of the two sums namely Rs and Rs As regards the sum of Rs it found that the assessee had agreed to similar addition in the earlier years and so the penalty was war ranted in similar amount for this year and taking into consideration that the sum involved was Rs it con sidered that a smaller penalty of Rs was imposable <ORG> took the view that the onus of proving concealment was on the <ORG> because proceedings for penalty were penal in character and held that so far as the sum of Rs was concerned it was not proved that there was any deliberate concealment that the <ORG> had not set aside the finding of the Assistant Inspecting Com missioner that the assessee surrendered the amount of Rs when it was faced with facts which clearly estab lished concealment that the assessee in fact had surren dered the amount only after the Income Tax Officer had conclusive evidence in his possession that the amount repre sented its income that acceptance by the assessee was material to give proper weight to judge the criminality of the action which in its opinion was not given and that the <ORG> omitted to take into account the fact that the assessee had admitted that the amount of Rs repre sented its income Allowing the appeal HELD In an income tax reference a finding on a question of pure fact could be reviewed by <ORG> only on the ground that there was no evidence to support it or that it was perverse If <ORG> found that there was no such evidence those circumstances would give rise to question of law and could be agitated in a reference A A When a conclusion has been reached on an apprecia tion of a number of facts established by the evidence whether that is sound or not must be determined not by considering the weight to be attached to each single fact in isolation but by assessing the cumulative effect of all the facts in their setting as a whole Where an ultimate finding on an issue is an inference to be drawn from the facts found on the application of any principles of law there would be a mixed question of law and fact and the inference from the facts found in such a case would be a question of law It took into account all the relevant facts in a proper light in rendering a finding of fact <ORG> was wrong in saying that proper weight had not been given to all the evidence and admissions made by the assessee jurisdiction under the Income Tax Reference in answering the question of law The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This appeal by special leave is from the judgment and order of <ORG> dated rd December in the Income Tax Reference On th March the Income Tax Officer issued notice under section read with section of the Income Tax Act hereinafter called the Act in respect of the assessment year for imposing penalty After considering the reply the Inspecting Assistant Commissioner on st October imposed a penalty of Rs under section read with section of the Act holding inter alia that there was concealment of income to the tune of Rs and the maximum penalty of Rs was imposable in law but a sum of Rs was imposed as penalty considering the facts and circumstances of the case The assessee preferred an appeal against the said order Whether there is any material to warrant the finding that the assessee company had concealed the particulars of its income or deliberately furnished inaccurate particulars thereof within the meaning of section of the Income Tax Act and Whether on the facts and in the circum stances of the case the <ORG> is correct in reducing the penalty under section from Rs to Rs <ORG> was of the opinion that the third question did not clearly bring out the matter in dispute between the parties and as such it was reframed as follows Whether on the facts and in the circum stances the finding of the <ORG> that the assessee had not concealed income to the extent of Rs and Rs within the meaning of section of the Indian Income Tax Act is correct in law <ORG> noted that the Income Tax Officer had made certain additions and disallowed certain expenses and of the various amounts disallowed only three amounts were required to be considered by <ORG> namely i inflation in price of sugar cane of an amount of Rs ii excess shortage claimed for cane Rs and iii salary of out station staff of loading contractors of Rs So far as the first question is concerned <ORG> held in favour of revenue and answered the question in the negative There is no dispute about that question too in so far as there is no appeal by the revenue The assessee has come up in appeal to this Court challenging the correctness of that answer In this appeal we are con cerned with the correctness or otherwise of the answer given to this question and the appeal must be confined to the correctness of the answer given to the third question as reframed The Income Tax Officer in his assessment order out of which this penalty proceedings arose noted that there were several disallowances in various accounts and he mentioned altogether items totalling Rs All these were on account of disallowances Main item was shortage in cane and the amount was Rs Another items was salary of out station staff and the amount was Rs There was also addition of Rs on account of inflation in the price of sugar cane Salary amounting to Rs paid by the contractors to their staff working at out centres was debited in the books and while it was claimed that the staff working at these centres were actually employed by the company on investigation the claim was found to be false In this connec tion a reference was made to the statement of one <NAME> He had stated that he had employed five per sons at the out centres and there was no employee of the mill working at the centres He confirmed that he had paid the employees out of his own funds and had categorically denied that they were the employees of the mill or that they were paid by it The salary bill was thereby inflated by Rs The Inspecting Assistant Commissioner therefore held that the assessee had concealed income to the extent of Rs He had also come to the conclusion that the cane purchases noted against these last entries were false and fictitious and the quantity covered by these entries was Mds It was also borne out by records that the amounts were not included in the return by the company He therefore found that the tax sought to be evaded came to Rs and the maxi mum penalty worked out to Rs He came in only for a later year In fact he had gone to the extent of and stated as to what staff was maintained in that centre there was a man in charge of the centre a weighment clerk a cane clerk and three to four chowkidars The <ORG> was of the view that the mere fact that the amounts were agreed to be taken into account by the assessee did not ipso facto indicate any criminality in its action to conceal any portion of the income In that view of the matter <ORG> was of the opinion that so far as Rs was concerned it was not proved that there was any deliber ate concealment <ORG> highlighted that so far as Rs was concerned only on being faced with facts from which there could possibly be no escape from the inference that the amount represented his income that the assessee agreed to its inclusion So far as this question was answered in favour of the assessee and there is no challenge by the revenue it is not material any more It was urged before us that as the second question which was in general form has been answered in favour of the assessee the third question as reframed could not have been answered otherwise As evident from the discussion by <ORG> <ORG> confined to second question with regard to disallowance in respect of purchase of cane that amounted to Rs So therefore it cannot be said that in view of the answer given to the second question the third question was no longer open The second question was confined to only Rs So far as whether there was justification for the answer given to the reframed third question or was proper or not has to be judged on the basis as to how far <ORG> in a reference could interfere with a finding of fact and transform the same into a question of law on the ground that there has been non consideration of all relevant facts When a conclusion had been reached on an appreciation of a number of facts established by the evidence whether that was sound or not must be determined not by considering the weight to be attached to each single fact in isolation but by assessing the cumulative effect of all the facts in their setting as a whole Where an ultimate finding on an issue was an inference to be drawn from the facts found on the application of any principles of law there would be a mixed question of law and fact and the inference from the facts found was in such a case a question of law In the instant case there is a finding of fact and unless it could be said that all the relevant facts had not been considered in a proper light no question of law arises At least in the background of the law as it stood at the rele vant time that was the position It was necessary however that every fact for and against the assessee must have been considered with due care and the <ORG> must have given its finding in a manner which would clearly indicate what were the questions which arose for determination what was the evidence pro and contra in regard to each one of them and what were the findings reached on the evidence on record before it The conclusions reached by the <ORG> should not be coloured by any irrelevant considerations or matters of prejudice and if there were any circumstances which required to be ex plained by the assessee the assessee should be given an opportunity of doing so We find that the assessee admitted that these were the income of the assessee but that was not an admission that there was deliberate concealment The <ORG> must in deciding an appeal consider with due care all the material facts and record its findings on all contentions raised by the asses see and the Commissioner in the light of the evidence and the relevant law An order recorded on a review of only a part of the evidence and ignoring the remaining evidence could not be regarded as conclusively determinative of the ques tion of fact raised before the <ORG> In our opinion the <ORG> has properly considered all the evidence in the instant case If <ORG> found that there was no such evidence to support the finding of fact of the <ORG> those circumstances would give rise to a question of law and could be agitated in a reference This Court again reiterated that it was also well established that when a <ORG> acted on material which was irrelevant to the enquiry or considered material which was partly relevant and partly irrelevant or based on conjectures surmises and suspicions and partly on evidence then in such a situation an issue of law arose and the finding of the <ORG> could be interfered with <ORG> was wrong in saying that proper weight had not been given to all the evidence and admissions made by the asses see We are further of the opinion that the reframed question must be answered in the affirmative and in favour of the assessee The appeal is allowed and the judgment and order of <ORG> in so far as answer to the question No is concerned is set aside The assessee is entitled to the costs of this appeal
