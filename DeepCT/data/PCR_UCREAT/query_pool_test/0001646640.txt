indigenously manufac tured bulk drug shall be sold Clause of Paragraph provides that while so fixing the price of a bulk drug the <ORG> may take into account the average cost of produc tion of such bulk drug manufactured by a efficient manufac turer and allow a reasonable return on net worth Paragraph empowers the <ORG> to fix leader prices of formula tions of categories I and II while paragraph empowers the <ORG> to fix retail prices of formulations of category III The Central <ORG> issued notifications under paragraph of the Order fixing the maximum prices at which various indigenously manufactured bulk drugs could be sold <ORG> quashed those notifications on the ground of failure to observe the principles of natural justice Since prices of formulations are primarily dependent on prices of bulk drugs the notifications fixing the retail prices of formulations issued during the pendency of review petitions were also quashed In the appeal by <ORG> it was contended that the fixation of maximum price under paragraph of the Order was a legislative activity and therefore not subject to any principle of natural justice that paragraph of the Order gave a remedy to the manufacturers to seek a review of the order fixing the maximum price under paragraph that such review did not partake the character of a judicial or quasi judicial proceedings and that at the time of the hearing of the review application the matter under went thorough and detailed discussion between the parties and the <ORG> as well as <ORG> and that the prices had not been fixed in an arbitrary manner For the respondents it was contended that unlike other price control legislations the Drugs Prices Control Order was designed to induce better production by providing for a fair return to the manufacturers that the provision for an enquiry proceeding the determination of the price of a bulk drug the prescription in paragraph clause that the average cast of production of the bulk drug manufactured by an efficient manufacturer should be taken into account and that a reasonable return on net worth should be allowed and the provision for a review of the order determining the price established that price fixation under the Order was a quasi judicial activity obliging the observance of the rules of natural justice that the review for which provision is made by paragraph was certainly of quasi judicial char acter and therefore it was necessary that the manufactur ers should be informed of the basis for the fixation of the price that the price had been fixed in an arbitrary manner and the <ORG> was not willing to disclose the basis on which the prices were fixed on the pretext that it may involve disclosure of matters of confidential nature that since the price of formulations were dependent on the prices of bulk drugs these should not have been prescribed until the review application was disposed of that the undertaking given by the parties before <ORG> while obtaining ex parte interim order to main tain the stanus quo on the prices of bulk drugs and formula tions prevailing before the issue of notifications and in case of dismissal of their petitions to deposit the differ ence in the prices of the formulations in the <ORG> lapsed with the disposal of the writ petition and it could no longer be enforced and that the delay in filing special leave petitions against other manufacturers should not be condoned as the <ORG> was well versed litigant as compared to private litigants But it has jurisdiction to en quire into the question in appropriate proceedings whether relevant considerations have gone in and irrelevant consid erations kept out of the determination of the price For example if the legislature has decreed the pricing policy and prescribed the factors which should guide the determina tion of the price the <ORG> will if necessary enquire into the question whether the policy and factors were present to the mind of the authorities specifying the price The right of the citizen to obtain essential articles at fair prices and duty of the <ORG> to provide them are thus transformed into the power of the <ORG> to fix prices and obligation of the producer to charge no more than the price fixed A price fixation measure does not concern itself with the interests of an individual manufacturer or produc er It is intended to operate in future It is conceived in the interest of the general consumer public Legislation is the process of formulating a general rule of conduct without reference to particular cases and usually operating in future administration is the process of performing particu lar acts of issuing particular orders or of making deci sions which apply general rules to particular cases Price fixation may occasionally assume an adminis trative or quasi judicial character when it relates to acquisition or requisition of goods or property from indi viduals and it becomes necessary to fix the price separately in relation to such individuals Such situations may arise when the owner of property or goods is compelled to sell his property or goods to the <ORG> or its nominee and the price to be paid is directed by the legislature to be deter mined according to the statutory guidelines laid down by it In such situations the determination of price may acquire a quasi judicial character In the case of subordinate legislation it may happen that Parlia ment may itself provide for a notice and for a hearing in which case the substantial non observance of the statutorily prescribed mode of observing natural justice may have the effect of invalidating the subordinate legislation But where the legislature has not chosen to provide for any notice or hearing no one can insist upon it and it will not be permissible to read natural justice into such legislative activity A Occasionally the legislature directs the subordinate legislating body to make such enquiry as it think fit before making the subordinate legislation In such a situa tion while such enquiry by the subordinate legislating body as it deems fit is a condition precedent to the subordinate legislation the nature and the extent of the enquiry is in the discretion of the subordinate legislating body and the subordinate legislation is not open to question on the ground that the enquiry was not as fur as it might have been It is differ ent from an enquiry in which an opportunity is required to he given to persons likely to he affected The former is an enquiry leading to a legislative activity while the latter is an enquiry which ends in an administrative or quasi judicial decision Such an enquiry as it thinks fit contemplated by it is an en quiry of the former character to he made for the purposes of fixing the maximum price at which a bulk drug may he sold with a view to regulating its equitable distribution and making it available at a fair price for the benefit of the ultimate consumer in consonance with Art In fixing the price of a bulk drug the <ORG> is expressly required by the Order to take into account the average cost of production of such bulk drug manufactured by an efficient manufacturer and allow a reasonable return on net worth It is a curious amalgam of a hearing which occa sianally precedes a subordinate legislative activity such as the fixing of municipal rates etc The reviewing authority has the fullest freedom and discretion under paragraph of the Order to prescribe its own procedure and consider the matter brought before it so long as it does not travel beyond the parameters prescribed by paragraph in the case of a review against an order made under that paragraph and the respective other paragraphs in the case of other orders It is open to the subordinate legislating body to prescribe and adopt its own mode of ascertaining the cost of production and the items to be included and excluded in so doing It could not therefore be said in the instant case that the subordinate legislating authority acted unreasona bly in prescribing the norms in the manner it has done From the legislative nature of the activity of the <ORG> it is clear that it is under no obligation to make any disclosure of any information received and consid ered by it in making the order but in order to render effec tive the right to seek a review given to an aggrieved per son the <ORG> if so requested by the aggrieved manu facturer is under an obligation to disclose any relevant information which may reasonably be disclosed pertaining to the average cost of production of the bulk drug manufac tured by an efficient manufacturer and the reasonable return on net worth In the instant case the procedure followed by the <ORG> in furnishing the requisite particulars at the time of the hearing of the review applications and discuss ing across the table the various items that hod been taken into account was sufficient compliance with the demands of fair play in the case of the class of persons claiming to by affected by the fixation of maximum price under the Drugs Prices Control Order It cannot therefore be said that there was anything unfair in the procedure adopted by the <ORG> The ques tions that obsolete quantitative usages had been taken into consideration proximate cost data had been ignored and the data relating to the year ending November had been adopted as the basis that there were errors in totalling errors in the calculation of prices of utilities errors in the calculation of net worth and many other similar er rors were questions to be raised before the <ORG> in the review application under paragraph Where prices of essential commodities are fixed in order to maintain or increase their supply or for securing their equitable distribution and availability at fair prices the court should not make any interim order staying the implementation of the notification fixing the prices There was no doubt in anyone mind that the matter would be taken up in appeal to the Supreme <ORG> whichever way the writ petitions were decided The undertakings given by the parties in the present cases were thus intended to and do continue to subsist The <ORG> is directed to dispose of the review applications after giving notice of hearing to the manufac turer In this group of cases we are faced with a different problem of alleged exploitation by big manufacturers of bulk drugs By way of illustration we may straightaway mention a glaring instance of such high pricing which was brought to our notice at the very commencement of the hear ing The Government however fixed the price at Rs per Kg For the moment ignoring the price fixed by the Government we see that the price of Rs per Kg at which the manu facturer was previously selling the drug and at which he continues to market the drug to this day because of the quashing of the order fixing the price by <ORG> is so unconsciously high even compared with the price claimed by himself that it appears to justify the charge that some manufacturers do indulge in profiteering It is in pursuance of the powers granted to <ORG> by the Essential Commodi ties Act that first the Drugs Prices Control Order and later the Drugs Prices Control Order were made Armed with authority under the Drugs Prices Control Order <ORG> issued notifications fixing the maximum prices at which various indigenously manufactured bulk drugs may be sold by the manufacturers These notifica tions were questioned on several grounds by the manufactur ers and they have been quashed by <ORG> on the ground of failure to observe the principles of natural justice Since prices of formulations are primarily de pendent on prices of buli drugs the notifications fixing the retail prices of formulations were also quashed Nevertheless <ORG> gave detailed directions regarding the manner of disposal of the review petitions by <ORG> <ORG> has preferred these appeals by Special leave of this Court against the judgment of <ORG> Before we turn to the terms of the Drugs Prices Con trol Order we would like to make certain general observations and explain the legal position in regard to them We concern ourselves neither with the policy nor with the rates But we do not totally deny ourselves the jurisdiction to enquire into the question in appropriate proceedings whether relevant considerations have gone in and irrelevant consid erations kept out of the determination of the price For example if the <ORG> has decreed the pricing policy and prescribed the factors which should guide the determina tion of the price we will if necessary enquire into the question whether the policy and the factors are present to the mind of the authorities specifying the price We will not deluge ourselves with more facts and figures The assem bling of the raw materials and the mechanics of price fixa tion are the concern of the executive and we leave it to them And we will not revaluate the considerations even if the prices are demonstrably injurious to some manufacturers or producers The <ORG> will of course examine if there is any hostile discrimination In the case of subordinate legislation it may happen that <ORG> may itself provide for a notice and for a hearing there are several instances of the legislature requiring the subordinate legislating authority to give public notice and a public hearing before say for example levying a municipal rate in which case the substantial non observance of the statutorily prescribed mode of observing natural justice may have the effect of invalidating the subordinate legislation The right here given to rate payers or others is in the nature of a concession which is not to detract from the character of the activity as legislative and not quasijudi cial But where the legislature has not chosen to provide for any notice or hearing no one can insist upon it and it will not be permissible to read natural justice into such legislative activity Occasionally the legislature directs the subordinate legislating body to make such enquiry as it thinks fit before making the subordinate legislation In such a situa tion while such enquiry by the subordinate legislating body as it deems fit is a condition precedent to the subordinate legislation the nature and the extent of the enquiry is in the discretion of the subordinate legislating body and the subordinate legislation is not open to question on the ground that the enquiry was not as full as it might have been The provision for such enquiry as it thinks fit is generally an enabling provision intended to facilitate the subordinate legislating body to obtain relevant information from all and whatever source and not intended to vest any right in any one other than the subordinate legislating body It is true that with the proliferation of delegated legislation there is a tendency for the line between legis lation and administration to vanish into an illusion Admin istrative quasi judicial decisions tend to merge in legis lative activity and conversely legislative activity tends to fade into and present an appearance of an administrative or quasi judicial activity Any attempt to draw a distinct line between legislative and administrative functions it has been said is difficult in theory and impossible in practice Legislation is the process of formulating a general rule of conduct without reference to particular cases and usually operating in future adminis tration is the process of performing particular acts of issuing particular orders or of making decisions which apply general rules to particular cases It has also been said Rule making is normally directed toward the formulation of requirements having a general application to all members of a broadly identifiable class while an adjudication on the other hand applies to specific individuals or situa tions A price fixation measure does not concern itself with the interests of an individual manufacturer or producer It is intended to operate in the future It is conceived in the interests of the general consumer public The right of the citizen to obtain essential articles at fair prices and the duty of the <ORG> to so provide them are transformed into the power of the <ORG> to fix prices and the obligation of the producer to charge more than the price fixed Price fixation may occasionally assume an administrative or quasi judicial character when it relates to acquisition or requisition of goods or property from individuals and it becomes necessary to fix the price separately in relation to such individuals Such situations may arise when the owner of property or goods is compelled to sell his property or goods to the <ORG> or its nominee and the price to be paid is directed by the legislature to be determined accord ing to the statutory guidelines laid down by it In such situations the determination of price may acquire aquasi judicial character We also wish to clear a misapprehension which appears to prevail in certain circles that price fixation affects the manufacturer or producer primarily and therefore fairness requires that he be given an opportunity and that fair opportunity to the manufacturer or producer must be read into the procedure for price fixa tion We do not agree with the basic premise that price fixation primarily affects manufacturers and producers It is for their protection that price fixation is resorted to and any increase in price affects them as seriously as any decrease does a manufacturer if not more If the prices of yarn or cloth were fixed in such a way to enable the manufacturer or producer recover his cost of production and secure a reasonable margin of profit no aspect of infringe ment of any fundamental right could be said to arise It was to be remembered that the mere fact that some of those were engaged in the industry trade or commerce alleged that they were incurring loss would not render the law stipulating the price unreasonable It was observed The control of prices may have effect either on maintaining or increasing supply of com modity or securing equit able distribution and availability at fair prices The controlled price has to retain this equilibrium in the supply and demand of the commodity The producer must have an incentive to produce In fixing the prices a price line has to be held in order to give preference or pre dominant consideration to the interest of the consumer or the general public over that of the produc ers in respect of essential commodities The aspect of ensuring availability of the essen tial commodities to the consumer equitably and at fair price is the most important considera tion He may have to bear loss in the same way as he does when he suf fers losses on account of economic forces operating in the business If an essential commodity is in short supply or there is hoarding concerning or there is unusual demand there is abnormal increase in price There is no justification that the producer should be given the benefit of price increase attributable to hoarding or cornering or artificial short supply The controlled price will enable both the consumer and the producer to tide over difficulties therefore any restriction in excess of what would be neces sary in the interest of general public or to remedy the evil has to be very carefully considered so that the producer does not perish and the consumer is not crippled The cases of <ORG> and <ORG> were distinguished on the ground that they were governed by sub section of sec The case of <ORG> was distinguished on the ground that the deci sion was rendered by invitation and on the agreement of the parties irrespective of technical and legal questions The Court quoted with approval a passage from Secretary of <ORG> <ORG> US stating Suffice it to say that since <ORG> fixed the quotas on a historical basis it is not for this Court to reweigh the relevant factors and per chance substitute its notion of expediency and fairness for that of <ORG> It could not there fore give rise to a complaint that a rule of natural justice has not been followed in fixing the price Reasonableness for purposes of judging whether there was an excess of power or an arbitrary exercise of it is really the demonstration of a rea sonable nexus between the matters which are taken into account in exercising a power and the purposes of exercise of that power in <ORG> that it was enough compliance with the Constitutional man date if the basis adopted for price fixation was not shown to be so patently unreasonable as to be in excess of the power to fix the price He observed In the ultimate analysis the mechanics of price fixation has necessarily to be left to the judgment of the Executive and unless it is patent that there is hostiled discrimination against a class of operators the processual basis of price fixation has to be accepted in the generality of cases as valid reaf firmed the approval accorded to the statement in Secretary of Agriculture <ORG> supra that <ORG> could not be converted into tribunals for relief from the crudities and inequities of complicated experimental economic legislation <ORG> was consid ered and it was affirmed that the judgment in that case could not be treated as precedent and could not afford any appreciable assistance in the decision of price fixation cases as it proceeded partly on agreement between the par ties and partly on concessions made at the bar who delivered a separate opinion for himself and for <NAME> agreed that the judgment in <ORG> was not to provide a precedent in price fixation case He indicated the indicia which led him to the conclusion that price fixation was a legislative measure He observed We think that unless by the terms of a particular statute or order price fixation is made a quasi judicial function for speci fied purposes or cases it is really legisla tive in character in the type of control order which is now before us because it satisfies the tests of legislation It is meant to lay down a general rule applicable to all persons or objects or transactions of a particular kind or class In the case before us the Control Order applies to sales of mustard oil anywhere in India by any dealer Its validity does not depend on the observance of any procedure to be complied with or particular types of evi dence to be taken on any specified matters as conditions precedent to its validity The test of validity is constituted by the nexus shown between the order passed and the purposes for which it can be passed or in other words by reasonableness judged by possible or probable consequences The former had said There is no doubt that a minister or any other body in making legislation for example by statutory instrument or by law is not subject to the rules of natural justice <NAME> Lord <NAME>m of St The latter had said There is no right to be heard before the making of legislation whether primary or dele gated unless it is provided by statutes Pani pat and Anakapalle were both cases where the question was regarding the price payable to a person who was required to sell to the <ORG> a certain percentage of the quantity of sugar produced in his mill It provides that in calculating the amount to be paid for the commodity required to be sold regard is to be had to a the minimum price if any fixed for sugarcane by <ORG> under this section the manufac turing cost of sugar the duty or tax if any paid or payable thereon and the securing of a reasonable return on the capital employed in the business of manufacturing sugar It is further prescribed that different prices may be determined from time to time for different areas or for different factories or for different kinds of sugar We may refer at this juncture to some illuminating passages from <NAME> book on Administrative Law He said If a particular function is termed legisla tive or rulemaking rather than judicial or adjudication it may have substantial effects upon the parties concerned If the function is treated as legislative in nature there is no right to notice and hearing unless a statute expressly requires them XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX As a federal court has recently pointed out there is no bright line between rule making and adjudication The most famous pre APA attempt to explain the difference between legislative and judicial functions was made by Justice <NAME> in <NAME> <ORG> A judicial inquiry said he investigates declares and enforces liabili ties as they stand on present or past facts and under laws supposed already to exist Legislation on the other hand looks to the future and changes existing conditions by making a new rule to be applied thereafter to all or some part of those subject to its power According to Chief Justice <NAME> Rulemaking is nor mally directed toward the formulation of requirements having a general application to all members of a broadly identifiable class An adjudication on the other hand applies to specific individuals or situations The Drugs Prices Control Order defined Bulk Drugs as follows Bulk drugs means any unprecessed phamaceu tical chemical biological and plant product or medicinal gas conforming to pharmacopocial or other standards accepted which is used as such or after being processed into formula tions and includes an essential bulk drug Bulk drugs were divided into essential bulk drugs which were included in the schedule and bulk drugs which were not so included In the case of bulk drugs which were not included in the schedule a manufacturer was entitled to continue to market the product at the same price at which he was market ing the products at the time of the commencement of the order It was said The concern about drug prices therefore really arises from the fact that many of them are essential to the health and welfare of the community and that there is no justification for the drug industry charging prices and having a production pattern which is based not upon the needs of the community but on aggres sive marketing tactices and created demand Yet another variant of a selectivity according to <ORG> would be to identify product groups which individually are important and which collec tively constitute the bulk of the output of the industry retention price in relation to a bulk drug means the price fixed under paras and for individual manufacturers or importers or distributors or such bulk drugs Paragraph of the Order enables the <ORG> with a view to regulating the equitable distribution of any indigenously manufactured bulk drug specified in the first or the second schedule and making it available at a fair price and after making such enquiry as it deems fit to fix from time to time by notification in the official gazette the maximum price at which the bulk drug shall be sold Clause of Paragraph provides that while so fixing the price of a bulk drug the <ORG> may take into account the average cost of production of such bulk drug manufac tured by an efficient manufacturer and allow a reasonable return on net worth By way of an explanation efficient manufacturer is defined to mean a manufacturer i Whose production of such bulk drug in relation to the total pro duction of such bulk drug in the country is large or ii who employs efficient technology in the production of such bulk drug It is then prescribed by clause No person shall sell a bulk drug at a price exceeding the price notified under sub para graph plus local taxes if any payable provided that until the price of bulk drug is so notified the price of such bulk drug shall be the price which prevailed immediately before the commencement of this order and the manufacture of such bulk drug at a price exceeding the price which prevailed as afore said Paragraph a requires a manufacturer commencing production of the bulk drug specified in the First or Second Schedule the price of which has already been notified by the <ORG> not to sell the bulk drug at a price exceeding the notified price Paragraph provides that where the price of a bulk drug has not been notified by the <ORG> the manufac turer shall within days of the commencement of the the production of such bulk drug make an application to the <ORG> in Form I and intimate the <ORG> the price at which he intends to sell the bulk drug and the <ORG> may after making such an enquiry as it thinks fit by order fix a provisional price at which such bulk drug shall be sold Paragraph of the order provides that notwith standing anything contained in paragraph the <ORG> may if it considers necessary or expedient so to do for increasing the production of an indigenously manufactured bulk drug specified in the first or second schedule by order fix a a retention price of such bulk drug a common sale price for such bulk drug taking into account the weighted average of the retention price fixed under clause a It is meant to provide a fillip to individual manufacturers of bulk drugs whose production it is necessary to increase drugs specified in First and Second Schedules Paragraph deals with the power of the <ORG> to fix retention price and pooled price for the sale of bulk drugs specified in the First and Second Schedules which are both indigenously manufactured and imported Paragraph empowers the <ORG> to direct manufacturers of bulk drugs to sell bulk drugs to manufacturers of formulations Paragraph empowers the <ORG> to fix leader prices of formulations of categories I and II specified in the third schedule Paragraph empowers the <ORG> to fix retail price of formulations specified in category III of third schedule Paragraph contains some general provisions regarding prices of formulations Paragraph empowers the <ORG> to revise prices of formulations Paragraph provides that where any manufacturer importer or distributor of any bulk drug or formulation fails to furnish information as required under the order within the time specified therein the <ORG> may on the basis of such information as may be available with it by order fix a price in respect of such bulk drug or formu lation as the case may be It is provided that the amount credited to the Drugs Prices Equaliza tion Account shall be spent for paying to the manufacturer the shortfall between his retention price and the common selling price or as the case may be the pooled price Form No which is referred to in paragraphs and is titled Form of application for fixation or revision of prices of bulk drug It was only thereafter that notifications fixing the prices were issued He further submitted that paragraph of the Central Order gave a remedy to the manufacturers to seek a review of the order fixing the maximum price under paragraph The review contemplated by paragraph in so far as it related to the notification under paragraph it was sub mitted by the learned Additional Solicitor General did not partake the character of a judicial or quasi judicial pro ceeding Reference was made to the <ORG> report which had recommended a return of to post tax return on equity that is paid up capital plus reserves and the Statement on Drug Policy which mentioned that ceiling prices may be determined by taking into account production costs and a reasonable return Great emphasis was laid on the second clause of paragraph of the Order which provides that in fixing the price of a bulk drug the Gov ernment may take into account the average cost of production of such bulk drug manufactured by an efficient manufacturer and allow a reasonable return on networth It was submitted that the provision for an enquiry preceding the determina tion of the price of a bulk drug the prescription in para graph clause that the average cost of production of the drug manufactured by an efficient manufacturer should be taken into account and that a reasonable return on networth should be allowed and the provision for a review of the order determining the price established that price fixation under the Drugs Prices Control Order was a quasi judicial activity obliging the observance of the rules of natural justice The suggestion of the learned counsel was that the nature of the review under paragraph was so apparently quasi judicial and that the need to know the reasons for the order sought to be reviewed was so real if the manufacturer was effectively to exercise his right to seek the quasijudicial remedy of review that by necessary implication it became obvious that the Order fixing the maximum price must be considered to be quasi judicial and not legislative in character The provision for enquiry in the first clause of paragraph and the prescrip tion of the matters to be taken into account in the second clause of paragraph further strengthened the implication according to the learned counsel It was contended that in any case whatever be the nature of the enquiry and the order contemplated by paragraph the review for which provision made by paragraph was certainly of a quasi judicial character and therefore it was necessary that the manufacturers should be informed of the basis for the fixa tion of the price and furnished with details of the same in order that they may truly and effectively avail themselves of the remedy of review It was argued with reference to various facts and figures that the price had been fixed in an arbitrary manner and the Government was not willing to disclose the basis on which the prices were fixed on the pretext that it may involve disclosure of matters of confi dential nature It was stated that the applications of the manufacturers for review of the notifications fixing the prices had not been disposed of for years though time was really of the very essence of the matter The prices of formulations were dependent on the prices of drugs and it was not right that prices of formulations should have been fixed even before the applications for review against the notifications fixing the price of bulk drugs were disposed of It was suggested that the delay in disposing of the review applications had the effect of rendering the original notifications fixing the prices unreal and out of date and liable to be struck down on that ground alone We are unable to agree with the submissions of the learned counsel for the respondents either with regard to the applicability of the principles of natural justice or with regard to the nature and the scope of the enquiry and review contemplated by paragraphs and while making our preliminary observations we pointed out that price fixation is essentially a legislative activity though in rare circum stances as in the case of a compulsory sale to the Govern ment or its nominee it may assume the character of an administrative or quasijudicial activity Nothing in the scheme of the Drugs Prices Control Order induces us to hold that price fixation under the Drugs Prices Control Order is not a legislative activity but a quasi judicial activity which would attract the observance of the princi ples of natural justice In the present case the enquiry contemplated by paragraph of Drugs Prices Control Order is to be made for the purposes of fixing the maximum price at which a bulk drug may be sold with a view to regulating its equitable distribution and making it available at a fair price So information may be gathered from whatever source considered desirable by the <ORG> Such enquiry as it thinks fit is an enquiry in which information is sought from whatever source considered necessary by the enquiring body and is different from an enquiry in which an opportunity is required to be given to persons likely to be affected The former is an enquiry leading to a legislative activity while the latter is an enquiry which ends in an administrative or quasi judicial decision The legislative activity being a subordinate or dele gated legislative activity it must necessarily comply with the statutory conditions if any no more and no less and no implications of natural justice can be read into it unless it is a statutory condition It is a curious amalgam of a hearing which occasionally precedes a subordinate legislative activity such as the fixing of municipal rates etc It is a hearing which follows a subordinate legislative activity intended to provide an opportunity to affected persons such as the manufacturers the industry and the consumer public to bring to the notice of the subordinate legislating body the difficulties or problems experienced or likely to be experienced by them consequent on the price fixation whereupon the Government may make appropriate orders Since the maximum price of a bulk drug is required by paragraph to be notified any fresh decision taken in the proceeding for review by way of modification of the maximum price has to be made by a fresh notification fixing the new maximum price of the bulk drug Once we have ascertained the nature and character of the review the further question regarding the scope and extent of the review is not very difficult to answer The reviewing authority has the fullest freedom and discretion to prescribe its own procedure and con sider the matter brought before it so long as it does not travel beyond the parameters prescribed by paragraph in the case of a review against an order under paragraph and the respective other paragraphs in the case of other orders Manufacturers of any bulk drug are either one or a few in number and generally they may be presumed to be well informed persons well able to take care of themselves who have the assistance of Accountants Advocates and experts to advise and espouse their cause In the context of the Drug industry with which we are concerned and in regard to which the Control Order is made we must proceed on the basis that the manufacturers of bulk drugs are generally persons who know all that is to be known about the price fixed by the <ORG> From the legislative nature of the activity of the <ORG> it is clear that the <ORG> is under no obligation to make any disclosure of any information received and considered by it in making the order but in order to render effective the right to seek a review given to an aggrieved person we think that the <ORG> if so requested by the aggrieved manufacturer is under an obligation to disclose any relevant information which may reasonably be disclosed pertaining to the average cost of production of the bulk drug manufactured by an efficient manufacturer and the reasonable return on net worth For example the manufacturer may require the Gov ernment to give information regarding the particulars de tailed in Form No of the Fourth Schedule which have been taken into account and those which have been excluded The manufacturer may also require to be informed the elements which were taken into account and those which were excluded in assessing the free reserves entering into the calcula tion of net worth That we think is the nature and scope of the review contemplated by Paragraph in relation to orders made under Paragraphs and The decision rendered without disclosing the report of <ORG> and without affording reasonable opportuni ty to the appellants to present their case was contrary to natural justice was therefore void supra it was decided by the court that the power of review granted to <ORG> under Rule of the Mineral Concession Rules required the authority to act judicially and its decision would be a quasi judicial act and the fact that Rule gave power to <ORG> to pass such order as it may deem just and proper did not negative the duty to act judicial ly In <ORG> it was observed that in cases where owing to the compulsion of the fact situation or the necessity of taking speedy action no pre decisional hearing is given but the action is followed soon by a full post decisional hear ing to the person affected there is in reality no exclusion of the audi alteram partem rule The court pointed out that it would be impermissible to interpret a statutory instrument to exclude natural justice unless the language of the instru ment left no option to the court As we said these cases have no application to a review of subordinate legislation by the subordinate legislating body at the instance of a party It may also be questioned on any ground on which a subordi nate legislation may be questioned such as being contrary to constitutional or other statutory provisions It may be questioned on the ground of a denial of the right guaranteed by Art There is no question before us that paragraph prescribes any arbitrary guideline It was however submitted that the guidelines were not adhered to and that facts and figures were arbitrarily assumed We do not propose to delve into the question whether there has been any such arbitrary assumption of facts and figures We think that if there is any grievance on that score the proper thing for the manufacturers to do is bring it to the notice of the <ORG> in their applications for review As already stated by us manufacturers of bulk drugs who claim to be affected by the Drugs prices Control Order belong to a class of persons who are well and fully informed of every intricate detail and particular which is required to be taken into account in determining the price The affidavits filed on behalf of <ORG> show that the procedure which is adopted in hearing the review applications is to discuss across the table the various items that have been taken into account We do not consider that there is anything unfair in the procedure adopted by the <ORG> Indeed we find that the hearing given to the manufacturers is often protected As we said we do not propose to examine this ques tion as we do not want to constitute ourselves into a court of appeal over the <ORG> in the matter of price fixa tion The learned counsel argued that there were several patent errors which came to light during the course of the hearing in <ORG> It was submitted that there were errors in totalling errors in the calculation of prices of utilities errors in the calcula tion of net worth and many other similar errors As we pointed out earlier these are all matters which should legitimately be raised in the review application if there is any substance in them We think that the question has to be decided with reference to the defini tion of free reserve in paragraph of the Control Order and not on any assumed principle of accountancy Referring to the proforma attached to Form No of the Fourth Schedule in which are set out several items which have to be taken into account in assessing the cost of production the learned counsel at tacks the notes at the end of Item No which mentions the various items of expenses to be excluded in ascertaining the cost The notes is as follows Notes i Items of expenses to be excluded from costs a Bonus in excess of statutory minimum In particular he argued that Item a bonus in excess of statutory minimum should not have been excluded so also items of expenditure coming under the other heads to which had been allowed by Income tax authorities as legiti mate expenses His submission was that where bonus in excess of statutory minimum was payable under the provisions of the Bonus Act there was no option left to the manufacturer not to pay the excess bonus Similarly where expenses have been legitimately incurred and allowed by Income tax authorities there was no justification for excluding those items of expenditure from the cost It was open to the subordinate legislating body to prescribe and adopt its own mode of ascertaining the cost of production and the items to be included and excluded in so doing We do not agree with the submission While on the question on formulations we would like to refer to the Oration of Dr <NAME> at the th Annual Convocation of the National Academy of Medical Sciences where he posed the question Why do we produce formulations of drugs worth Rs crores which reach only of the population when <ORG> recommends only drugs and Rs crores worth would suf fice for all our people if used in an ethical manner A general submission of the learned counsel was that the price of formulations should not have been prescribed until the review application filed by the manufacturer in regard to the patent bulk drugs was disposed of He submitted that the price of a formulation was dependant on the price of the bulk drug and it was therefore not right to fix the price of formulation when the price of bulk drug was in question in the review application and there was a prospect of the price of the bulk drug being increased We do not see any force in the submission If a review application is allowed and the price of the bulk drug is raised and if in the meanwhile the formulation had been ordered to be sold at a low price it may result in consid erable loss to the manufacturer Another submission of <NAME> was that there was considerable delay in the disposal of the review applica tions by the Govern ment and that even now no orders had been passed in several cases If review applications are not disposed of expeditiously the notifications fixing the prices must be struck down as having become obsolete But it does not follow that the notification fixing the maximum price must necessarily be struck down as obsolete by the mere passage of time We notice that in all these matters <ORG> granted stay of implementation of the notifications fixing the maximum prices of bulk drugs and the retail prices of formulations We think that in matter of this nature where prices of essential commodities are fixed in order to main tain or increase supply of the commodities or for securing the equitable distribution and availability at fair prices of the commodity it is not right that the court should make any interim order staying the implementation of the notifi cation fixing the prices In the present case on ex parte interim order was made on April in the following terms In the meanwhile on the petitioners giving an undertakings to maintain prices both for bulk and formulation as were prevailing prior to the impugned notification we stay implemen tation of the impugned bulk drug prices as well as formulation prices Thereafter on November a further order was made to the following effect After hearing learned counsel and with their consent and arrangement has been worked out as on interim measure We there fore confirm till further orders the interim order made by us on April The terms of the said order that is on the undertaking given on behalf of the petitioners to maintain status quo on the prices prevail ing prior to the issue of the impugned notifi cation the petitioners through their counsel further given an undertaking to this court that in case the petition is dismissed and the rule is discharged the petitioners shall within eight weeks of the dismissal of the petition by this court deposit in this court the difference in the prices of the formula tions in question for being equaliza tion account It is made clear that the under taking is without prejudice to the petition ers right to take appropriate directions from <ORG> if so advised in this re gard It was argued by the learned counsel that the undertaking given by the parties lapsed with the disposal of the writ petition by <ORG> and that it could no longer be enforced We do not agree with this submission Apart from the fact that an appeal is ordinarily considered to be a continuation of the original proceeding in the present case we notice that further orders of <ORG> were also in contempla tion and such further orders could only be if appeals were preferred to <ORG> We do not think that there was any doubt in anyone mind that the matter would be taken up in appeal to <ORG> whichever way the writ petitions were decided We are of the view that the undertakings given by the parties in the present cases were intended to and do continue to subsist On the conclusions arrived at by us we have no doubt that the appeal must be allowed and the writ petition in <ORG> dismissed However we think that it is necessary to give a direction to the Government to dispose of the review applications after giving a notice of hearing to the manufacturer Any information sought by the manufacturer may be given to him at the hearing in terms of what we have said in the judgment It appears that although several writ petitions filed by different manufacturers were disposed of by <ORG> by a common judgment <ORG> filed an appeal within the prescribed period of limitation against one of the manufacturers <ORG> only This was apparently done under some misapprehension that it would be enough if a single appeal was filed As these petitions were filed beyond the prescribed period of limitation petitions for condoning the delay in filing the petitions for special leave to appeal had to be and were filed It is con tended that the <ORG> is a well verse litigant as compared with private litigants and even if there is justi fication of adopting a liberal approach in condoning delay in the case of private litigants there was no need to adopt such approach in the case of the <ORG> In cases like the present where parties have acted on the assumption that no appeals had been filed against them and have proceeded to arrange their affairs accordingly it would be unjust to condone the delay in filing the appeals at the instance of the <ORG> Though we see considerable force in the submission of <NAME> we think that the circumstances of the instant cases do justify the exercise of our discretion to condone the delay One is that all the writ petitions were disposed of by a common judgment and an appeal had been filed in the principal case We therefore condone the delay grant special leave in all the petitions for special leave and direct the ap peals to be listed for hearing on May
