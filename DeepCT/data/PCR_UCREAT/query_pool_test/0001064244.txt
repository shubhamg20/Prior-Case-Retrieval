Though reference is made in the grounds of appeal to the carton being a piece of artistic work within Section of the Copyright Act arguments were mainly focussed on trade dress The appellants grievance in the suit as well as in the IA was that the carton was likely to confuse the buyers of corn flakes and there was every likelihood of consumers purchasing the respondent goods in the belief that they were of the appellant I would have had no hesitation to accept the arguments of Mr <NAME> Applying the test laid down therein I am of the view that the trade dress of the defendant in this case is entirely different from the trade dress of the plaintiff and there is absolutely no scope for any confusion In this appeal we have heard learned counsel for the appellant at the stage of admission It was contended before us that the learned single Judge having accepted the legal principles relied upon for the appellant in respect of trade dress erred on facts in holding that there was no scope for confusion among the consumers It was pointed that the size and shape of the carton was similar being rectangular that in the words FLAKES in the appellant carton the words and A were joined together closely or rather touch each other that respondent also described his goods as original and the best that both contain a picture of the corn flakes that there was a small square on the left hand top where the words <ORG> CORN FLAKES were written inside the square and that the respondent had also put a square on the left hand top with the words AIMS ARISTO CORN FLAKES It was further stated that in all the cartons of <ORG> in regard to various commodities there was a red band at the top which took off from the square on the left top and ran horizontally across on the front top into the right and to the other sides and respondent also used a similar red band taking off horizontally from the square on the left top It was submitted that there was a presumption that the consumer memory was short and if a consumer had purchased a carton of appellant at one point of time he would easily mistake the respondent carton for the appellant Before we go into the above aspects it is necessary to refer to a few more facts In <ORG> <NAME> RPC the plaintiff bag displayed the words Fison Gro Bag while the defendant bag contained the words <ORG> Crop Bag and it was held that the prominence given to the name overshadowed the other similarities in get up While refusing injunction <ORG> observed that even accepting that the plaintiff had a get up reputation in their growing bags and though there were obvious similarities between the bags in issue it was inconceivable that any one seeing the defendant grow bag could fall to observe that it was a product of the defendants and that a normal purchaser could not be misled He further said that if the <ORG> Gro Bag had not contained the name <ORG> or if the name <ORG> had not been so prominently displayed by the defendants he might have reached a different conclusion He doubted whether they could have done more to signify to a buyer that he was watching at a product of <ORG> and not at a product of <ORG> The plaintiff was selling for years dried materials for soup in packets of certain size shape and printing put in steel boxes of a peculiar kind with the words <NAME> displayed thereon <ORG> refused to grant injunction and in <ORG> while confirming his order <NAME> observed that the word <NAME> being printed prominently on the packets and the words <ORG> printed on defendant packets there was no scope for confusion in spite of the similarity in the packets and boxes It was held by <ORG> that a fraudulent intent cannot be presumed inspite of the similarities in the bottles labels colour and medallion because the distinguishing feature of name adopted by defendants showed that they had no intention to deceive purchasers He said I can quite understand a case in which although colourably a defendant has introduced his own name yet the nature of the wrapping up the nature of the package itself or in this case the shape of the bottle may all have been so closely imitated that the mere introduction of some distinctive mark to which no ordinary observer would have applied his mind will not get rid of the obvious intention to pass one goods off as the other but to apply the proposition to this case appears to me to be a little short of ridiculous It was held that the name of <ORG> was so plainly placed upon the bottle as it could possibly be and it was in the place where Schweppes was on the bottle of the appellant and there was no intention to deceive In the present case in spite of any other close resemble ness in the cartons the name <ORG> written prominently on the respondents carton would in our view prima facie as in case before Lord <NAME> show that there was no intention on the part of the defendant to play fraud by misrepresenting his goods as the goods of the appellant He said Inasmuch as you and certainly not to impute fraud without proof you are not to suggest that people are fradulently committing some commercial trick without sufficient evidence and I cannot conceive here how anybody could gravely argue that the one thing could be mistaken for the other by anybody who looked as it That brings us finally to the question of the failing memory of the customer It has now been held that there are limitations to the theory of imperfect memory It says The <ORG> must bear in mind that the marks will not normally be seen side by side and quard against the danger that a person seeing the new mark may think that it is the same as one he has seen before or even that it is a new or associated mark of the proprietor of the formal mark Marks are often remembered by general impressions of by same essential feature <ORG> RPC PC on appeal RPC who are the persons who go to purchase <ORG> Corn Flakes Prima facie in our opinion these people belong to a middle class or upper middle class and above who are fairly educated in English and are able to distinguish <ORG> and what is not <ORG> para page it is said that it is necessary to note the fact that customers for fasteners are sophisticated and discerning that defendant acted with goods faith <NAME> in fact observed in the above case Of course one knows that the persons who buy these articles are generally persons of some education my opinion is having regard to the nature of the customer the article in question and the price at which it is likely to be sold and all the surrounding circumstances no man of ordinary intelligence is likely to be deceived We are on the facts of the case before us prima facie of the same opinion in regard to <ORG> and <ORG> Learned counsel for the appellant placed reliance on <ORG> <NAME> supra Prima facie the case goes against the view expressed by <ORG> in the cases referred to above Further this case has been placed in a special category by writers because here the picture of the sweets on the top of the boxes was so similar spreading over the entire face of the box and the learned Judge felt more impressed by that fact though the names were not so similar this view appears from Halsbury Law of England th Ed <NAME> says para that this case was treated as a case of deliberate copying offending plaintiff copyright It was also held that there was infringement of registered trade mark So far as passing off was concerned it was seen as a case where having regard to the arrangement of the picture of the sweets on the top of the box that a person with imperfect memory could be misled In the result on our prima facie conclusions we reject the plea of similarity or likelihood of confusion we reject the plea of fraud as well as the one based on imperfect memory We are of the view prima facie that even though the get up is similar the different names <ORG> and <ORG> prominently displayed make all the difference and this is not a fit case for interference with the order of the learned Single Judge refusing injunction These are prima facie views and it is made clear that the suit will be disposed of on the basis of such evidence as may be produced therein without being influenced by anything said here
