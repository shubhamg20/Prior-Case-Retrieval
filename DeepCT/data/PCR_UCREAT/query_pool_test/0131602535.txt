<ORG> through its Secretary has filed the above Writ Petition to issue a Writ of Declaration declaring the ceiling on the wages of the employees with regard to entitlement for Bonus in Section of the Payment of Bonus Act as illegal and unconstitutional and consequently direct the respondents and not to impose ceiling on the wages of the employees Class III and IV Categories with regard to entitlement for Bonus and direct the respondents and to pay arrears of bonus for the period from to Most of the employees of the third respondent were getting bonus until they crossed the limit of Rs The Secretary of the petitioner Union who is the deponent of the affidavit filed in support of the above writ petition was getting bonus till and thereafter became eligible as a result of the ceiling on wages at Rs <ORG> of which the petitioner <ORG> is an affiliate made representations to <ORG> for amendment of Section to remove the ceiling so as to make all employees particularly Class IV and III eligible to get bonus Joint Director <ORG> first respondent herein has filed a counter affidavit disputing various averments made by the petitioner Section of the Payment of Bonus Act defining Employees by which employee drawing more than rupees would be ineligible for bonus The scheme of payment of Bonus to persons employed in certain establishments is on the basis of profit or productivity The Government can revise a ceiling on salary or wage for entitlement of bonus depending on the conditions prevailing in the country The amendment is with reference to salary or wages earned by the employees and not with reference to class III or IV employees Section of the Payment of Bonus Act provides for payment of statutory minimum bonus of percent and maximum of per cent In the light of the above pleadings I have heard Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the petitioner Employees Association Mr <NAME> learned Additional Solicitor General for respondents and and Mr <NAME> for third respondent He also contended that there is no such ceiling under Gratuity Act Workmen Compensation Act and other Social Welfare Legislation On the other hand Mr <NAME> learned Additional Solicitor General appearing for respondents and after pointing out the history of the enactment contended that it is a legislation policy and it is for the <ORG> which alone can prescribe and increase the ceiling According to him it must be left to the wisdom of the <ORG> Mr <NAME> appearing for the third respondent adopted the argument of the learned Additional Solicitor General In order to appreciate the rival contentions it is useful to refer the definition employee in Section of the Payment of bonus Act hereinafter referred to as the Act Section employee means any person other than an apprentice employed on a salary or wage not exceeding three thousand and five hundred rupees per mensem in any industry to do any skilled or unskilled manual supervisory managerial administrative technical or clerical work of hire or reward whether the terms of employment be express or implied Section of the Act is also relevant which speaks about calculation of bonus with respect to certain employees It is to be noted that at the time of enactment of the Act in the ceiling of a salary or wage was fixed at Rs it was subsequently enhanced to Rs and by Amendment Act the ceiling was raised to Rs with effect from It is also stated that there is no ceiling to claim gratuity under the Payment of Gratuity Act or compensation under Workmen Compensation Act Now I shall consider decisions cited by Mr <NAME> in support of his claim that ceiling provided under Section of the Act is bad and irrational <ORG> has accepted the first contention namely that the ceiling of Rs is unrealistic On the other hand we are dealing with bonus under a statute namely Payment of Bonus Act In that case the tenants of residential buildings were paying monthly rent exceeding Rs excepted from the protection of the Tamil Nadu Buildings Lease and Rent Control Act After holding that there is no justification at all for picking out the class of tenants of residential buildings paying a rent of more than four hundred rupees per month to deny them the rights conferred generally on all tenants of buildings residential or non residential by the Act that the tenants of non residential buildings cannot be said to be in a disadvantageous position as compared with tenants of residential buildings and that the argument based on protection of the weaker section of the community is entirely inconsistent with the protection given to tenants of non residential buildings who are in a position to pay much higher rents than the rents which those who are in occupation of residential buildings can ever pay <ORG> struck down Section ii of the Act as violative of Article of the Constitution of India Mr <NAME> learned Additional Solicitor General by pointing out that unless those provisions are in pari materia with Payment of Bonus Act the same cannot be cited as a binding decision for the issue in question The following conclusion of Their Lordships is relevant para It is true that the courts while construing a provision of an enactment often follow the decisions by the courts construing similar provision of an enactment in pari materia The object behind the application of the said rule of construction is to avoid contradiction between the two statutes dealing with the same subject But in the present case what we find is that the Madhya Bharat Land Revenue and Tenancy Act contains one integrated scheme providing for remedy to a pucca tenant claiming restoration of possession under Section and of the Act In the repealing Act i Land Revenue Code we do not find any provision like Section of the Act It is not a sound principle of construction to interpret a provision of an enactment following the decisions rendered on a similar provision of an enactment when two statutes are not in pari materia We have considered the arguments of both the parties In our view it is clear that the interpretation has to be on the basis of the expression agricultural produce as set out in Section a of the said Act All the cases relied upon by Mr <NAME> are cases under the taxing statutes where the interpretation has been given on the basis of the terms as defined in those statutes We have considered the submission made by the parties The settled principles of interpretation are that the court must proceed on the assumption that the legislature did not make a mistake and that it did what it intended to do The court must as far as possible adopt a construction which will carry out the obvious intention of the legislature Undoubtedly if there is a defect or an omission in the words used by by legislature the court would not go to its aid to correct or make up the deficiency The court could not add words to a statute or read words into it which are not there especially when the literal reading produces an intelligible result There is no provision in the Act which negates the power of <ORG> to grant pardon <ORG> has power to grant pardon at any stage of the proceedings Learned Solicitor General in our view rightly contends that the other statutes are only an external aid to the interpretation and to rely upon the omission of a provision which is contained in another different enactment it has to be shown that the two Acts are similar which is not the position here We find that Kantilal Trikamlal case supports the view taken in Getty Chettiar case Added to this Section of the Estate Duty Act defining property came up for consideration in Kantilal Trikamlal case cited supra We may state here itself that the words and expressions defined in one statute as judicially interpreted do not afford a guide to construction of the same words or expressions in another statute unless both the statutes are pari materia legislation or it is specifically so provided in one statute to give the same meaning to the words as defined in the other statute All the above decisions of <ORG> make it clear that the words and expression defined in one statute as judicially interpreted do not afford a guide to construction of the same words or expressions in another statute unless both the statutes are pari materia legislations Further it is clear that the other statutes are only an external aid to the interpretation and to rely upon the omission of a provision which is contained in another different enactment it has to be shown that the two Acts are similar It is also stated that the <ORG> while construing a provision of an enactment often follow the decisions by the courts construing similar provision of an enactment in pari materia The object behind the application of the said rule of construction is to avoid contradiction between the two statutes dealing with the same subject The cases relied on by Mr <NAME> are cases under Tamil Nadu Buildings Lease and Rent Control Act and Bombay Rent Control Act where the interpretation has been given on the basis of the terms as defined in those statutes Accordingly as rightly argued by the learned Additional Solicitor General those principles cannot be applied to the present case Before <ORG> one of the contentions of the petitioner was that the bonus which the <ORG> has directed the Management to pay was in the nature of deferred wages that impugned legislation had the effect of freezing wages and that <ORG> not being vested with the power to reduce the wages the legislation is invalid on that account as well On behalf of <ORG> it was contended before <ORG> that the power of legislation is plenary and it is open to the law maker to amend or repeal existing legislation so long as it acts within its field of legislative competence and that such power extends to taking away vested rights The amendment made by the impugned enactment is to the <ORG> <ORG> of India Act and other enactments concerning other public sector <ORG>s By Section of the <ORG> <ORG> of India Act the <ORG> was vested with the power to change the conditions of service of those of its employees who had earlier served in the Imperial <ORG> Those employees cannot assert that they have a vested unalterable right in their terms and conditions of the employment So far as other employees are concerned by Section of the Act the <ORG> is empowered to determine the terms and conditions of service <ORG> has undoubted power to legislate on the topic of bonus and <ORG> is not precluded from legislating on that topic in enactments other than the Payment of Bonus Act The bonus though calculated on basis of wages can no longer be termed as a deferred wage though that description had been given to it by the <ORG> prior to the enactment of the Bonus Act While bonus may form part of wages for purpose of some of the other enactments governing employees the right to receive bonus and the extent is as regulated or permitted under the Bonus Act It is settled that in matters of economic policy the <ORG> must have a larger area in which to make its decisions without the supervision of the <ORG> as the <ORG> is the better Judge of what the policy should be in relation to matters of economic Likewise <ORG> has power to legislate on the topic of bonus The right to receive bonus and extent is as regulated or permitted under the Bonus Act To sum up after the enactment of the Payment of Bonus Act the right to receive bonus and the extent is as regulated or permitted under the Bonus Act There is no scope for claiming bonus de hors the provisions therein In such a circumstance it is not fair principle of construction to interpret a provision of enactment following a decision rendered in a similar provision of the enactment when the statutes are not in pari materia The cases relied on by Mr <NAME> are cases under different statutes where the interpretation has been given on the basis of the terms given in those statutes In our case I have already referred to the fact that at the time of enactment of Bonus Act the ceiling was fixed at Rs and the same was increased to Rs and again by Act it was further increased to Rs Likewise the figure mentioned in Section of the Act also increased periodically I hold that Section of the Payment of Bonus Act defining an employee is constitutional and the same is valid in law The scheme of payment of bonus to persons employed in certain establishments is on the basis of profit or productivity With the above observation I hold that Section defining an employee in the Payment of Bonus Act is constitutional valid in law and the same is not liable to be struck down Accordingly the Writ Petition fails and the same is dismissed
