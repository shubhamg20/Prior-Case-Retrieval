This is an appeal by special leave from the judgment of <ORG> confirming the death sentence imposed upon each of the three appellants under Section read with Section of the Penal Code for the murder of five persons belonging to one family Because of the family disputes and rivalry a serious occurrence took place at about sun set time on the nd of December resulting in the death of five members of the same family The two brothers amely <NAME> and <NAME> who could throw light on this aspect of the atter are both killed in the occurrence Saying they went towards a well and the fields of <NAME> where <NAME> and <NAME> were Since <NAME> did not notice as to whether any person was dead or alive and himself had seen the attack on <NAME> only in the report which he lodged he mentioned only that part of the occurrence which he had seen with his own eyes He however convicted the three appellants under Section read with Section of the Penal Code imposing death sentence on each of them as also a fine of Rs Mr <NAME> learned Counsel for the appellants made several submissions to persuade us to acquit them or in any event to commute the death sentence imposed upon each of them We have considered all the submissions made many of them were of such a nature that we had no hesitation in rejecting them outright At the outset it may be mentioned that the prosecution had also led evidence of recoveries of certain articles said to have been made at the instance of the accused But finding infirmities in that evidence <ORG> did not rely upon them He was therefore acquitted The three appellants were convicted for the murder of <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> chiefly upon the evidence of <NAME> PW <NAME> PW and partly upon the evidence of <NAME> PW Mr <NAME> asked us to reject the evidence of <NAME> and <NAME> in its totality because they had implicated <NAME> also On the facts and in the circumstances of this case we find no substance in this argument The two courts of fact have rightly believed theirevidence The other criticism was that Sarpanch <NAME> and another Sarpanch named <NAME> to whom one of the prosecution witnesses had gone were not examined They were not eye witnesses and it is not possible for us to take the view that their non examination in any way affected the prosecution case There were two dying declarations of <NAME> one oral and the other written which was recorded by the Assistant Sub Inspector of Police PW on We do not mean to suggest that such dying declarations are always untrustworthy but what we want to emphasize is that better and more reliable methods of recording a dying declarations of an injured person should be taken recourse to and the one recorded by the Police Officer may be relied upon if there was no time of facility available to the prosecution for adopting any better method There is a dying declaration of <NAME> Ext At the direction of the Assistant Sub Inspector of Police PW he recorded the statement of <NAME> at the spot It could not be rejected on the ground that it was recorded by a Police Officer as he was in a critical condition and no other person could be available in the village to record the dying declaration of <NAME> But we find that there is a difficulty in relying upon this dying declaration The dying declaration seems to be otherwise truthful but for the fact that it could not be within the knowledge or vision of <NAME> that <NAME> was murdered by the appellants In all probability they had committed the murder of these two person also because after having raised the Lalkara they went towards the field where <NAME> and <NAME> were We are not impressed with the argument advanced on behalf of the appellants that the occurrence did not take place at about sun set time or that the First Information Report was ante timed merely because the Illaqa Magistrate received the said report late by a few hours It is difficult to accept the suggestion in this case that the appellants were falsely implicated and some unknown two persons had committed the murder of so many family members of <NAME> For the reasons stated above we maintain the conviction of all the three appellants under Section read with Section of the Penal Code for the murder of <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> We also maintain their other convictions There is no infirmity on that account at all Special reasons have been given by both the courts for imposing the extreme penalty of death on each of three appellants While generally agreeing with those reasons we feel persuaded to take a somewhat lenient view in the case of <NAME> In the result we uphold the conviction of all the appellants under various counts to the extent and in the manner indicated above We uphold the sentence of death awarded to appellants <NAME> and <NAME> but set aside the imposition of fine of Rs We commute the sentence of death imposed upon <NAME> and instead sentence him to undergo imprisonment for life The appeals are dismissed subject to the modification in the sentence as made above
