Petitioners have further pleaded that the amendment also seeks to alter the fundamental right of equality which is part of the basic structure of the Constitution Petitioners say that by attaching consequential seniority to the accelerated promotion the impugned amendment violates equality in Article read with Article Petitioners further say that by providing reservation in the matter of promotion with consequential seniority there is impairment of efficiency A roster point promotee in the graduate stream would reach the th level by the time he attains the age of years At the age of he would reach the highest level and stay there for nine years On the other hand the general merit promotee would reach the rd level out of levels at the age of and by the time he gets eligibility to the th level he would have retired from service Petitioners say that the consequences of the impugned th Amendment which provides for reservation in promotion with consequential seniority would result in reverse discrimination in the percentage of representation of the reserved category officers in the higher cadre BROAD ISSUES IN WRIT PETITION No OF The broad issues that arise for determination in this case relate to the Implementation of i the Constitution Seventy Seventh Amendment Act the Constitution Eighty First Amendment Act the Constitution Eighty Second Amendment Act and the Constitution Eighty Fifth Amendment Act and ii Action taken in pursuance thereof which seek to reverse decisions of <ORG> in matters relating to promotion and their application with retrospective effect ARGUMENTS The substance of the arguments advanced on behalf of the petitioners briefly is as follows Equality is a part of the basic structure and it is impossible to conceive of the Constitution without equality as one of its central components That equality is the basic feature referred to in the preamble to our Constitution Petitioners further submit that Article is integral to equality that Article has to be read with Article and with several Articles in Part IV According to the petitioners the Constitution places an important significance on public employment and the rule of equality inasmuch as a specific guarantee is given under Article protecting equality principles in public employment In this connection reliance is also placed on the provisions of Part XIV to show that the Constitution makers had given importance to public employment by making a special provision in the form of Part XIV providing certain rights and protection to the office holders in the services of the Union and the States Special provisions have also been made in Article A which permits establishment of tribunals as special and adjudicatory mechanism These judgments also provide conclusions based on principles which gave meaning to equality both as an individual right and as group expectations As regards the words nothing in this article in Article it is urged that these words cannot wipe out Article and therefore they have a limited meaning It is urged that the said words also occur in Articles A and It is urged that as an individual right in Article enforceability is provided for whereas group expectation in Article is not a fundamental right but it is an enabling power which is not coupled with duty It is submitted that if the structural balance of equality in the light of the efficiency is disturbed and if the individual right is encroached upon by excessive support for group expectations it would amount to reverse discrimination Petitioners submit that <ORG> cannot under Article expand its amending power so as to acquire for itself the right to abrogate the Constitution and if the width of the amendment invites abrogation of the basic structure then such amendment must fail On the question of balancing and structuring of equality in employment it is urged that quotas are subject to quantitative limits and qualitative exclusions that there is a distinction between quota limits example to SCs and ceiling limits maximum permissible reservation limits example which comes under the category of quantitative limits It is urged that in numerous judgments and in particular in <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> II the equality of opportunity in public employment is clarified in order to structure and balance Articles and In answer to the respondents contentions that Articles A and and the changes to Article are merely enabling provisions and that in a given case if the exercise undertaken by the appropriate Government is found to be arbitrary this Court will set it right it is contended that ingressing the basic structure is a per se violation of the Constitution It is submitted that the th Amendment adding the words with consequential seniority in Article A has been made to nullify the decision in <NAME> Accordingly it is urged that the impugned amendments are violative of the basic structure and the fundamental values of the Constitution articulated in the preamble and encapsulated in Articles and that they violate the fundamental postulates of equality justice rule of law and secularism as enshrined in the Constitution and that they violate the fundamental role of <ORG> as interpreter of the Constitution That the impugned amendments create an untrammelled unrestrained and unconstitutional regime of reservations which destroys the judicial power and which undermines the efficacy of judicial review which is an integral part of rule of law It is argued that Articles and have to be read with Article as originally promulgated that the impugned amendments invade the twin principles of efficiency merit and the morale of public services and the foundation of good governance The power of amendment under Article is a constituent power and not a constituted power that that there are no implied limitations on the constituent power under Article that the power under Article has to keep the Constitution in repair as and when it becomes necessary and thereby protect and preserve the basic structure An interpretation placed by the <ORG> on any provision of the Constitution gets inbuilt in the provisions interpreted It is an ongoing process of judicial and constituent powers both contributing to change of law with the final say in the judiciary to pronounce on the validity of such change of law effected by the constituent power by examining whether such amendments violate the basic structure of the Constitution That there are no implied limitations on the power of the <ORG> under Article when it seeks to amend the Constitution It is further submitted that amendments for giving effect to the directive principles cannot offend the basic structure of the Constitution On the contrary the amendments which may abrogate individual rights but which promote Constitutional ideal of justice social economic and political and the ideal of equality of status are not liable to be struck down under Article or Article and consequently such amendments cannot violate the basic structure of the Constitution It is submitted that the principle of balancing of rights of the general category and reserved category in the context of Article has no nexus to the basic feature of the Constitution It is not by virtue of the power of the delegate but it is by virtue of constituent power itself having authorized such exercise by the delegate under Article that article shall stand overruled In this connection it is submitted that the impugned amendments have retained reservations at the recruitment level inconformity with the judgment in <NAME> which has confined Article only to initial appointments that Article A is a special provision which provides for reservation for promotion only to SCs and STs That in <NAME> the focus was on Backward Classes and not on SCs STs and therefore there was no balancing of rights of three groups namely general category other backward classes and scheduled castes scheduled tribes It is next submitted that this <ORG> has taken care of the interests of the general category by placing a ceiling on filling up of vacancies only to a maximum of for reservation It is next submitted that the amendment made by Article makes an exception to ceiling limit imposed by <NAME> by providing that the vacancies of previous years will not be considered with the current year vacancies In this connection it was urged that Article applies to reservations under Article and therefore if reservation is found to be within reasonable limits the <ORG> would uphold such reservations depending upon the facts of the case and if reservation suffers from excessiveness it may be invalidated For the above reasons respondents submit that there is no infirmity in the impugned constitutional amendments KEY ISSUE It is not necessary for us to deal with the above arguments serially The key issue which arises for determination in this case is whether by virtue of the impugned constitutional amendments the power of the <ORG> is so enlarged so as to obliterate any or all of the constitutional limitations and requirements STANDARDS OF JUDICIAL REVIEW OF CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS Constitution is not an ephermal legal document embodying a set of legal rules for the passing hour A Constitutional provision must be construed not in a narrow and constricted sense but in a wide and liberal manner so as to anticipate and take account of changing conditions and purposes so that constitutional provision does not get fossilized but remains flexible enough to meet the newly emerging problems and challenges Individuals possess basic human rights independently of any constitution by reason of basic fact that they are members of the human race These fundamental rights are important as they possess intrinsic value Part III of the Constitution does not confer fundamental rights It confirms their existence and gives them protection Its purpose is to withdraw certain subjects from the area of political controversy to place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts Every right has a content Every foundational value is put in Part III as fundamental right as it has intrinsic value A right becomes a fundamental right because it has foundational value Apart from the principles one has also to see the structure of the Article in which the fundamental value is incorporated A Constitution and in particular that of it which protects and which entrenches fundamental rights and freedoms to which all persons in the <ORG> are to be entitled is to be given a generous and purposive construction The <ORG> must interpret the Constitution in a manner which would enable the citizens to enjoy the rights guaranteed by it in the fullest measure Article of the Constitution provides that no person shall be deprived of his life and personal liberty except according to procedure established by law The Supreme <ORG> by a majority held that procedure established by law means any procedure established by law made by the <ORG> or the legislatures of the <ORG> The Supreme <ORG> refused to infuse the procedure with principles of natural justice The expression life in Article does not connote merely physical or animal existence The right to life includes right to live with human dignity This <ORG> has in numerous cases deduced fundamental features which are not specifically mentioned in Part III on the principle that certain unarticulated rights are implicit in the enumerated guarantees In India till recently there is no legislation securing freedom of information However this <ORG> by a liberal interpretation deduced the right to know and right to access information on the reasoning that the concept of an open government is the direct result from the right to know which is implicit in the right of free speech and expression guaranteed under Article a the basic structure concept was resorted to although no question of constitutional amendment was involved in that case A State Government may be dismissed not because it violates any particular provision of the Constitution but because it acts against a vital principle enacting and giving coherence to a number of particular provisions example Articles and Therefore it is important to note that the recognition of a basic structure in the context of amendment provides an insight that there are beyond the words of particular provisions systematic principles underlying and connecting the provisions of the Constitution These principles give coherence to the Constitution and make it an organic whole They give coherence to the Constitution Therefore we may have a look at common constitutional provisions under German Law which deal with rights such as freedom of press or religion which are not mere values they are justiciable and capable of interpretation are overarching principles which provide linking factor for principle of fundamental rights like Articles and This is how the doctrine of basic structure stands evolved under the German Constitution and by interpretation given to the concept by <ORG> The word amendment postulates that the old constitution survives without loss of its identity despite the change and it continues even though it has been subjected to alteration To conclude as observed by <NAME> CJ in <ORG> the Constitution is a precious heritage and therefore you cannot destroy its identity There is a moral dimension to every major constitutional case the language of the text is not necessarily a controlling factor There can be no rule of law if there is no equality before the law and rule of law and equality before the law would be empty words if their violation was not a matter of judicial scrutiny or judicial review and judicial relief and all these features would lose their significance if judicial executive and legislative functions were united in only one authority whose dictates had the force of law Judicial review of legislation enacted by the <ORG> within limited powers under the controlled constitution which we have has been a feature of our law and this is on the ground that any law passed by a legislature with limited powers is ultra vires if the limits are transgressed The framers conferred on <ORG> the power to issue writs for the speedy enforcement of those rights and made the right to approach <ORG> for such enforcement itself a fundamental right In the case of <ORG> Chandrachud speaking for the majority observed that Articles and do not confer any fanciful rights They confer rights which are elementary for the proper and effective functioning of democracy If Articles and are put out of operation Article will be rendered nugatory In the said judgment the majority took the view that the principles enumerated in Part IV are not the proclaimed monopoly of democracies alone The distinction between different forms of Government consists in the fact that a real democracy will endeavour to achieve its objectives through the discipline of fundamental freedoms like Articles and If Article is withdrawn the political pressures exercised by numerically large groups can tear the country apart by leading it to the legislation to pick and choose favoured areas and favourite classes for preferential treatment However as stated above its features are delineated over various provisions of the Constitution like Articles and and the three lists in the seventh schedule to the Constitution However there is a difference between formal equality and egalitarian equality which will be discussed later on WORKING TEST IN THE MATTER OF APPLICATION OF THE DOCTRINE OF BASIC STRUCTURE Once it is held that fundamental rights could be abridged but not destroyed and once it is further held that several features of the Constitution can not be destroyed the concept of express limitation on the amending power loses its force for a precise formulation of the basic feature of the Constitution and for the courts to pronounce on the validity of a constitutional amendment A working test has been evolved by <NAME> in the Election Case in which the learned Judge has rightly enunciated with respect that for determining whether a particular feature of the Constitution is a part of its basic structure one has per force to examine in each individual case the place of the particular feature in the scheme of the Constitution its object and purpose and the consequences of its denial on the integrity of the Constitution as a fundamental instrument of the country governance Basically Part III of the Constitution consists of the equality code the freedom code and the right to move the courts However each case has to be seen in the context of the placement of an Article which embodies the foundational value of equality There is a different view which says that reservation is merely providing a right of access and that it is not a right to redressal Applying the above test we have to consider the word reservation in the context of Article and it is in that context that Article of the Constitution which provides for relaxation of the standards of evaluation has to be seen JUSTICE SOCIAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL IS PROVIDED NOT ONLY IN PART IV DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES BUT ALSO IN PART III FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS India is constituted into a sovereign democratic republic to secure to all its citizens fraternity assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity of the nation Therefore rights conferred on citizens and non citizens are not merely individual or personal rights Article guarantees the fundamental right to equality before the law on all persons Great social injustice resulted from treating sections of the Hindu community as untouchable and therefore Article abolished untouchability and Article permitted the <ORG> to make any law providing for throwing open all public Hindu religious temples to untouchables The concept of public employment unlike right to property is socialistic and therefore falls within the preamble to the Constitution which states that WE THE PEOPLE OF INDIA having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a SOVEREIGN SOCIALIST SECULAR DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC The conflicting claim of individual right under Article and the preferential treatment given to a backward class has to be balanced When we construe Article it is equality in fact which plays the dominant role This problem has to be examined therefore on the facts of each case The difficulty is that there is no natural order of merit independent of our value system Unfortunately in the present case the debate before us on this point has taken place in an empirical vacuum The basic presumption however remains that it is the <ORG> who is in the best position to define and measure merit in whatever ways they consider it to be relevant to public employment because ultimately it has to bear the costs arising from errors in defining and measuring merit There is a conceptual distinction between a non discrimination principle and affirmative action under which the <ORG> is obliged to provide level playing field to the oppressed classes If the extent of reservation goes beyond cut off point then it results in reverse discrimination Therefore there are three criteria to judge the basis of distribution namely rights deserts or need The question of extent of reservation involves two questions Whether there is any upper limit beyond which reservation is not permissible Whether there is any limit to which seats can be reserved in a particular year in other words the issue is whether the percentage limit applies only on the total number of posts in the cadre or to the percentage of posts advertised every year as well The question of extent of reservation is closely linked to the issue whether Article is an exception to Article or is Article an application of Article It cannot be used for creating monopolies or for unduly or illegitimately disturbing the legitimate interests of other employees He further pointed out that Article which protects interests of certain sections of society has to be balanced against Article which protects the interests of every citizen of the entire society The fact that considerable number of members of backward class have been appointed promoted against general seats in the <ORG> services may be a relevant factor for the <ORG> Government to review the question of continuing reservation for the said class Number of vacancies that could be reserved <NAME> <NAME> who had given dissenting judgment in Rangachari observed that the requirement of Article is only to give adequate representation and since Constitution makers intended it to be a short term measure it may happen that all the posts in a year may be reserved After having reserved a fixed number of posts the Government may decide that till those posts are filled up by the backward classes all appointments will go to them if they fulfil the minimum qualification Once this number is reached the Government is deprived of its power to make further reservations Due to this the rule of carry forward reservation in a particular year amounted to of the total vacancies The petitioner contended that reservation was excessive which destroyed his right under Article and Article In order to effectuate the guarantee each year of recruitment will have to be considered by itself He relied on <NAME> <NAME> judgment in Rangachari and held that Article provides for adequate representation taking into consideration entire cadre strength According to him if it is within the power of the <ORG> to make reservations then reservation made in one selection or spread over many selections is only a convenient method of implementing the provision of reservation In the case of <NAME> under the Kerala State and Subordinate Services Rules certain relaxation was given to Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe candidates passing departmental tests for promotions <NAME> held that the promotions made in services as a whole is no where near of the total number of the posts In <ORG> the majority held that rule should be applied to each year otherwise it may happen that if entire cadre strength is taken as a unit the open competition channel gets choked for some years and meanwhile the general category candidates may become age barred and ineligible Both should be balanced and neither should be allowed to eclipse the other With regard to ruling in <NAME> case that reservation in a year should not go beyond the Court held that it applied to initial appointments The operation of a roster for filling the cadre strength by itself ensures that the reservation remains within the limit The Constitution Eighty first Amendment Act added Article which in substance gives legislative assent to the judgment in <NAME> CATCH UP RULE IS THE SAID RULE A CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT UNDER ARTICLE One of the contentions advanced on behalf of the petitioners is that the impugned amendments particularly the Constitution Seventy Seventh Amendment and Eight Fifth Amendment Acts obliterate all constitutional limitations on the amending power of the <ORG> That the width of these impugned amendments is so wide that it violates the basic structure of equality enshrined in the Constitution The key issue which arises for determination is whether the above catch up rule and the concept of consequential seniority are constitutional requirements of Article and of equality so as to be beyond the constitutional amendatory process In the category of Guards in the <ORG> there were four categories namely Grade Grade Grade A and Grade A Special The rule of reservation was applied not only at the initial stage of appointment to Grade but at every stage of promotion The general candidates asked for three reliefs namely a to restrain the <ORG> from filling up the posts in higher grades in the category of Guards by applying the rule of reservation to restrain the <ORG> from acting upon the seniority list prepared by them and to declare that the general candidates were alone entitled to be promoted and confirmed in Grade A Special on the strength of their seniority earlier to the reserved category employees It was contended by the general candidates that accelerated promotion may be given but the <ORG> cannot give consequential seniority to reserved category candidates in the promoted category This was opposed by the reserved category candidates who submitted that for the purposes of promotion to Grade A Special the seniority list pertaining to Grade A alone should be followed that the administration should not follow the seniority lists maintained by the administration pertaining to Grade as urged by the general candidates and since SCs and STs were senior to the general candidates in Grade A the seniority in Grade A alone should apply This Court gave following reasons for upholding the decision of the tribunal Secondly this Court opined that there is no uniform method of providing reservation It is open to the <ORG> if so advised to say that while the rule of reservation shall be applied the candidate promoted earlier by virtue of rule of reservation roster shall not be entitled to seniority over seniors in the feeder category and that it is open to the <ORG> to interpret the catch up rule in the service conditions governing the promotions See para Lastly this Court found on facts that for vacancies candidates were considered and they were all <ORG> candidates Not a single candidate belonged to general category It was argued on behalf of the general candidates that all top grades stood occupied exclusively by the reserved category members which violated the rule of equality underlying Articles and This Court opined that the above situation arose on account of faulty implementation of the rule of reservation as the <ORG> did not observe the principle that reservation must be in relation to posts and not vacancies and also for applying the roster even after the attainment of the requisite percentage reserved for SCs STs In <NAME> the controversy which arose for determination was whether after the members of <ORG> for whom specific percentage of posts stood reserved having been promoted against those posts was it open to the administration to grant consequential seniority against general category posts in the higher grade The appellant took a clear stand that he had no objection if members of <ORG> get accelerated promotions This Court opined that without catch up rule giving weightage to earlier promotion secured by roster point promotee would result in reverse discrimination and would violate equality under Articles and Accordingly this Court took the view that the seniority between the reserved category candidates and general candidates in the promoted category shall be governed by their panel position Therefore in Virpal Singh Chauhan this Court has said that the catch up rule insisted upon by the <ORG> though not implicit in Articles and is constitutionally valid as the said practice process was made to maintain efficiency <ORG> following the law laid down in <NAME> issued a circular on to the effect that the reserved candidates promoted on roster points could not claim seniority over the senior general candidates promoted later on However in the later judgment of this Court in the case of <NAME> another three Judge bench took the view that under the general rule of service jurisprudence relating to seniority the date of continuous officiation has to be taken into account and if so the roster point promotees were entitled to the benefit of continuous officiation Accordingly in <NAME> three points arose for consideration i Can the roster point promotees count their seniority in the promoted category from the date of their continuous officiation vis vis general candidates who were senior to them in the lower category and who were later promoted to the same level ii Have Virpal and <NAME> I have been correctly decided and has <NAME> correctly decided iii Whether the catch up principles are tenable At the outset this <ORG> stated that it was not concerned with the validity of constitutional amendments and therefore it proceeded on the assumption that Article A is valid and is not unconstitutional It was held that the primary purpose of Article and Article A is to give due representation to certain classes in certain posts keeping in mind Articles and that Articles and have prescribed permissive limits to affirmative action by way of reservation under Articles and A of the Constitution that Article is incorporated so that efficiency of administration is not jeopardized and that Articles and are closely connected as they deal with individual rights of the persons They give a positive command to the <ORG> that there shall be equality of opportunity of all citizens in public employment It was observed that Article provides to every employee otherwise eligible for promotion fundamental right to be considered for promotion It was held that equal opportunity means the right to be considered for promotion The right to be considered for promotion was not a statutory right It was held that Articles and A did not confer any fundamental right to reservation However in the context of balancing of fundamental rights under Article and the rights of reserved candidate under Articles and A this <ORG> opined that Article deals with a fundamental right whereas Articles and A are only enabling provisions and therefore the interests of the reserved classes must be balanced against the interests of other segments of society As a remedial measure the <ORG> held that in matters relating to affirmative action by the <ORG> the rights under Articles and are required to be protected and a reasonable balance should be struck so that the affirmative action by the <ORG> does not lead to reverse discrimination Before concluding we may refer to the judgment of this court in Badappanavar They contended that when they and the reserved candidates were appointed at Level and junior reserved candidates got promoted earlier on the basis of roster points to Level and again by way of roster points to Level and when the senior general candidate got promoted to Level then the general candidate would become senior to the reserved candidate at Level The above contentions raised by the appellants were rejected by the tribunal This Court found on facts that the concerned Service Rule did not contemplate computation of seniority in respect of roster promotions In <NAME> the circular which gave seniority to the roster point promotees was held to be violative of Articles and For this proposition this Court placed reliance on the judgment in <NAME> while holding that if creamy layer among backward classes were given some benefits as backward classes it will amount to equals being treated unequals Applying the creamy layer test this Court held that if roster point promotees are given consequential seniority it will violate the equality principle which is part of the basic structure of the Constitution and in which event even Article A cannot be of any help to the reserved category candidates The judgment in the case of <NAME> was mainly based on the judgment in <NAME> which had taken the view that the departmental circular which gave consequential seniority to the roster point promotee violated Articles and of the Constitution The above judgments therefore did not touch the questions which are involved in the present case In the former case the majority held that rule should be applied to each year otherwise it may happen that the open competition channel may get choked if the entire cadre strength is taken as a unit In our view appropriate Government has to apply the cadre strength as a unit in the operation of the roster in order to ascertain whether a given class group is adequately represented in the service With these introductory facts we may examine the scope of the impugned constitutional amendments <ORG> in its judgment dated in <NAME> stated that reservation of appointments or posts under Article is confined to initial appointment and cannot extend to reservation in the matter of promotion The Government felt that the judgment of this court in <NAME> adversely affected the interests of SCs and STs in services as they have not reached the required level We quote hereinbelow Statement of Objects and Reasons with the text of the Constitution Seventy Seventh Amendment Act introducing clause A in Article of the Constitution THE CONSTITUTION SEVENTY SEVENTH AMENDMENT ACT STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS The Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes have been enjoying the facility of reservation in promotion since This ruling of <ORG> will adversely affect the interests of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes Since the representation of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes in services in the States have not reached the required level it is necessary to continue the existing dispensation of providing reservation in promotion in the case of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes In view of the commitment of the Government to protect the interests of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes the Government have decided to continue the existing policy of reservation in promotion for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes The Bill seeks to achieve the aforesaid object THE CONSTITUTION SEVENTY SEVENTH AMENDMENT ACT Assented on th June and came into force on An Act further to amend the Constitution of India BE it enacted by <ORG> in the Forty sixth Year of the Republic of India as follows In Article of the Constitution after clause the following clause shall be inserted namely A Nothing in this Article shall prevent the <ORG> from making any provision for reservation in matters of promotion to any class or classes of posts in the services under the <ORG> in favour of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes which in the opinion of the <ORG> are not adequately represented in the services under the <ORG> The said clause A was inserted after clause of Article to say that nothing in the said Article shall prevent the <ORG> from making any provision for reservation in matters of promotion to any class of posts in the services under the <ORG> in favour of SCs and STs which in the opinion of the <ORG>s are not adequately represented in the services under the <ORG> It gives freedom to the <ORG> in an appropriate case depending upon the ground reality to provide for reservation in matters of promotion to any class or classes of posts in the services It gives freedom to the <ORG> to provide for reservation in matters of promotion If the said two reasons do not exist then the enabling provision cannot come into force The <ORG> can make provision for reservation only if the above two circumstances exist Further in Ajit Singh II this court has held that apart from backwardness and inadequacy of representation the <ORG> shall also keep in mind overall efficiency Article Therefore all the three factors have to be kept in mind by the appropriate <ORG> by providing for reservation in promotion for SCs and STs As such consequential seniority constituted additional benefit and therefore his seniority will be governed by the panel position According to the <ORG> the decisions in <NAME> and <NAME> in the concept of catch up rule adversely affected the interests of SCs and STs in the matter of seniority on promotion to the next higher grade State of Punjab AIR SC which led to the issue of the dated th January have adversely affected the interest of the Government servants belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes category in the matter of seniority on promotion to the next higher grade The Government has reviewed the position in the light of views received from various quarters and in order to protect the interest of the Government servants belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes it has been decided to negate the effect of dated th January immediately It is also necessary to give retrospective effect to the proposed constitutional amendment to Article A with effect from the date of coming into force of Article A itself that is from the th day of June The Bill seeks to achieve the aforesaid objects THE CONSTITUTION EIGHTY FIFTH AMENDMENT ACT The following Act of Parliament received the assent of the President on the th January and is published for general information An Act further to amend the Constitution of India This Act may be called the Constitution Eighty fifth Amendment Act It shall be deemed to have come into force on the th day of June Reading the Constitution Seventy Seventh Amendment Act with the Constitution Eighty Fifth Amendment Act clause A of Article now reads as follows A Nothing in this article shall prevent the <ORG> from making any provision for reservation in matters of promotion with consequential seniority to any class or classes of posts in the services under the <ORG> in favour of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes which in the opinion of the <ORG> are not adequately represented in the services under the <ORG> In <ORG> this court held that the number of vacancies to be filled up on the basis of reservation in a year including the carry forward reservations should in no case exceed the ceiling limit of However the <ORG> found that total reservation in a year for SCs STs and OBCs combined together had already reached and if the judgment of this court in <NAME> had to be applied it became difficult to fill backlog vacancies Quoted hereinbelow is the Statement of Objects and Reasons with the text of the Constitution Eighty First Amendment Act THE CONSTITUTION EIGHTY FIRST AMENDMENT ACT Assented on th June and came into force STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS Prior to August the vacancies reserved for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes which could not be filled up by direct recruitment on account of non availability of the candidates belonging to the Scheduled Castes or the Scheduled Tribes were treated as Backlog Vacancies <ORG> of India in its judgment in the Indra Sawhney versus Union of India held that the number of vacancies to be filled up on the basis of reservations in a year including carried forward reservations should in no case exceed the limit of fifty per cent As total reservations in a year for the Scheduled Castes the Scheduled Tribes and the other Backward Classes combined together had already reached forty nine and a half per cent and the total number of vacancies to be filled up in a year could not exceed fifty per cent The <ORG> after considering various representations reviewed the position and has decided to make amendment in the constitution so that the unfilled vacancies of a year which are reserved for being filled up in that year in accordance with any provision for reservation made under clause or clause A of Article of the Constitution shall be considered as a separate class of vacancies to be filled up in any succeeding year or years and such class of vacancies shall not be considered together with the vacancies of the year in which they are being filled up for determining the ceiling of fifty percent reservation on total number of vacancies of that year The Bill seeks to achieve the aforesaid object BE it enacted by <ORG> in the Fifty first Year of the Republic of India as follows Short title This Act may be called the Constitution Eighty first Amendment Act Amendment of Article In Article of the Constitution after clause A the following clause shall be inserted namely Nothing in this Article shall prevent the State from considering any unfilled vacancies of a year which are reserved for being filled up in that year in accordance with any provision for reservation made under clause or clause A as a separate class of vacancies to be filled up in any succeeding year or years and such class of vacancies shall not be considered together with the vacancies of the year in which they are being filled up for determining the ceiling of fifty per cent reservation on total number of vacancies of that year Once it is held that each point in the roster indicates a post which on falling vacant has to be filled by the particular category of candidate to be appointed against it and any subsequent vacancy has to be filled by that category candidate alone then the question of clubbing the unfilled vacancies with current vacancies do not arise If it is within the power of the <ORG> to make reservation then whether it is made in one selection or deferred selections is only a convenient method of implementation as long as it is post based subject to replacement theory and within the limitations indicated hereinafter By the Constitution Eighty Second Amendment Act a proviso was inserted at the end of Article of the Constitution which reads as under Provided that nothing in this article shall prevent in making of any provision in favour of the members of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes for relaxation in qualifying marks in any examination or lowering the standards of evaluation for reservation in matters of promotion to any class or classes of services or posts in connection with the affairs of the <ORG> or of a <ORG> This proviso was inserted keeping in mind the judgment of this court in <NAME> which took the view that relaxation in matters of reservation in promotion was not permissible under Article in view of the command contained in Article On one hand of the spectrum we have unfilled vacancies on the other hand we have a time spread over number of years over which unfilled vacancies are sought to be carried over WHETHER IMPUGNED CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS VIOLATES THE PRINCIPLE OF BASIC STRUCTURE The key question which arises in the matter of the challenge to the constitutional validity of the impugned amending Acts is whether the constitutional limitations on the amending power of the <ORG> are obliterated by the impugned amendments so as to violate the basic structure of the Constitution Clause of Article however states that the appropriate Government is free to provide for reservation in cases where it is satisfied on the basis of quantifiable data that backward class is inadequately represented in the services Therefore in every case where the <ORG> decides to provide for reservation there must exist two circumstances namely backwardness and inadequacy of representation There is no fixed yardstick to identify and measure these three factors it will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case These amendments do not alter the structure of Articles and equity code It was vehemently urged on behalf of the petitioners that the <ORG>ment of Objects and Reasons indicate that the impugned amendments have been promulgated by the <ORG> to overrule the decision of this court We do not find any merit in this argument The judgments of this court in <NAME> <NAME>I <NAME>II and <NAME> were judgments delivered by this court which enunciated the law of the land It is that law which is sought to be changed by the impugned constitutional amendments They leave it to the <ORG>s to provide for reservation The criterion for determining the validity of a law is the competence of the law making authority The competence of the law making authority would depend on the ambit of the legislative power and the limitations imposed thereon as also the limitations on mode of exercise of the power Though the amending power in Constitution is in the nature of a constituent power and differs in content from the legislative power the limitations imposed on the constituent power may be substantive as well as procedural Substantive limitations are those which restrict the field of the exercise of the amending power Procedural limitations on the other hand are those which impose restrictions with regard to the mode of exercise of the amending power Both these limitations touch and affect the constituent power itself disregard of which invalidates its exercise Applying the above tests to the present case there is no violation of the basic structure by any of the impugned amendments including the Constitution Eighty Second Amendment Act This exercise however will depend on facts of each case In our view the field of exercise of the amending power is retained by the impugned amendments as the impugned amendments have introduced merely enabling provisions because as stated above merit efficiency backwardness and inadequacy cannot be identified and measured in vacuum In conclusion we may quote the words of <NAME> ignoring our commitments may make us rationale but not free Article confers a personal right by enacting a prohibition which is absolute Therefore the basic principle underlying Article is that the law must operate equally on all persons under like circumstances This theory is based on the assumption that in the event of arbitrary exercise by those on whom the power is conferred would be corrected by the <ORG> The enabling provisions deal with the concept which has to be identified and valued as in the case of access vis vis efficiency which depends on the fact situation only and not abstract principle of equality in Article as spelt out in detail in Articles and Article provides for reservation for backward classes in cases of inadequate representation in public employment The object in enacting the enabling provisions like Articles A and is that the <ORG> is empowered to identify and recognize the compelling interests Therefore there is a basic difference between equality in law and equality in fact See Affirmative Action by <NAME> In a given case where excessiveness results in reverse discrimination this <ORG> has to examine individual cases and decide the matter in accordance with law Efficiency in administration is held to be a constitutional limitation on the discretion vested in the <ORG> to provide for reservation in public employment This proviso is also conferring discretionary power on the <ORG> to relax qualifying marks or standards of evaluation Moreover Article is to be read with Article which provides that the <ORG> shall promote with special care the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of the people and in particular of the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and shall protect them from social injustice TESTS TO JUDGE THE VALIDITY OF THE IMPUGNED STATE ACTS As stated above the boundaries of the width of the power namely the ceiling limit of the numerical benchmark the principle of creamy layer the compelling reasons namely backwardness inadequacy of representation and the overall administrative efficiency are not obliterated by the impugned amendments At the appropriate time we have to consider the law as enacted by various <ORG>s providing for reservation if challenged The <ORG> is free to exercise its discretion of providing for reservation subject to limitation namely that there must exist compelling reasons of backwardness inadequacy of representation in a class of post keeping in mind the overall administrative efficiency It is made clear that even if the <ORG> has reasons to make reservation as stated above if the impugned law violates any of the above substantive limits on the width of the power the same would be liable to be set aside It may equally be true that on the basis of that decision reservation may have been provided in the matter of promotion in some of the Central and <ORG> services but we are convinced that the majority opinion in Rangachari to the extent it holds that Article permits reservation even in the matter of promotion is not sustainable in principle and ought to be departed from However taking into consideration all the circumstances we direct that our decision on this question shall operate only prospectively and shall not affect promotions already made whether on temporary officiating or regular permanent basis It is further directed that wherever reservations are already provided in the matter of promotion be it <ORG> or <ORG> Services or for that matter services under any corporation authority or body falling under the definition of <ORG> in Article such reservations shall continue in operation for a period of five years from this day There is a difference between formal equality and egalitarian equality Article therefore creates a field which enables a <ORG> to provide for reservation provided there exists backwardness of a class and inadequacy of representation in employment It is only when these reasons are satisfied that a <ORG> gets the power to provide for reservation in matters of employment Therefore Article and Article operate in different fields Backwardness and inadequacy of representation therefore operate as justifications in the sense that the <ORG> gets the power to make reservation only if backwardness and inadequacy of representation exist Article A is inspired by the observations in <NAME> vide para and in which this Court has unequivocally observed that in order to avoid lumping of <ORG> <ORG> and ST which would make <ORG> take away all the vacancies leaving <ORG> and ST high and dry the concerned <ORG> was entitled to categorise and sub classify <ORG>s and STs on one hand vis vis <ORG> on the other hand We are of the opinion that there is no constitutional or legal bar to a <ORG> categorizing the backward classes as backward and more backward We are concerned with the question if a <ORG> makes such a categorisation whether it would be invalid We think not Let us take the criteria evolved by <ORG> Any caste group or class which scored eleven or more points was treated as a backward class Now it is not as if all the several thousands of castes groups classes scored identical points There may be some castes groups classes which have scored points between to and there may be some who have scored points between eleven and thirteen It cannot reasonably be denied that there is no difference between these two sets of castes groups classes If both of them are grouped together and reservation provided the inevitably result would be that gold smiths would take away all the reserved posts leaving none for vaddes In such a situation a <ORG> may think it advisable to make a categorisation even among other backward classes so as to ensure that the more backward among the backward classes obtain the benefits intended for them The Backward Classes have been divided into four categories Group comprises professional group like tappers weavers carpenters ironsmiths goldsmiths kamsalins etc Group pertains to Scheduled Castes converts to Christianity and their progeny while Group comprises all other classes communities groups which are not included in groups A and The vacancies reserved for backward classes are sub divided between them in proportion to their respective population There is another way of looking at this issue Article recognises only one class viz Even so it is beyond controversy that Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are also included in the expression backward class of citizens and that separate reservations can be provided in their favour What is the logic behind it It is that if Scheduled Tribes Scheduled Castes and Other Backward Classes are lumped together Cs will take away all the vacancies leaving Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes high and dry The same logic also warrants categorisation as between more backward and backward We are only saying that if a <ORG> chooses to do it it is not impermissible in law In the said judgment it has been held that the State could make such sub classification between SCs and STs vis vis OBC A classification must be founded on intelligible differential which distinguishes those that are grouped together from others The differential must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the law under challenge In <NAME> an opinion was expressed by this Court vide para that there is no constitutional or legal bar to making of classification In the case of Article we must keep in mind that following the judgment in <NAME> the concept of post based roster is introduced They have nexus with Articles and of the Constitution The test for judging the width of the power and the test for adjudicating the exercise of power by the concerned <ORG> are two different tests which warrant two different judicial approaches There are numerous petitions pending in this <ORG> in which reservations made under <ORG> enactments have been challenged as excessive In our present judgment we are upholding the validity of the constitutional amendments subject to the limitations Justification needs each case to be decided on case to case basis As against this it has been held vide para of Kesavananda Bharati that where the nature of the power granted by the Constitution is in doubt then the <ORG> has to take into account the consequences that might ensue by interpreting the same as an unlimited power The issue involved in the present case is concerning the width of the power In <NAME> this <ORG> has therefore accepted caste as determinant of backwardness and yet it has struck a balance with the principle of secularism which is the basic feature of the Constitution by bringing in the concept of creamy layer As stated above we are bound by the decision in <NAME> The question as to the determinant of backwardness cannot be gone into by us in view of the binding decision It is made clear that even if the <ORG> has compelling reasons as stated above the <ORG> will have to see that its reservation provision does not lead to excessiveness so as to breach the ceiling limit of or obliterate the creamy layer or extend the reservation indefinitely Subject to above we uphold the constitutional validity of the Constitution Seventy Seventh Amendment Act the Constitution Eighty First Amendment Act the Constitution Eighty Second Amendment Act and the Constitution Eighty Fifth Amendment Act We have not examined the validity of individual enactments of appropriate States and that question will be gone into in individual writ petition by the appropriate bench in accordance with law laid down by us in the present case
