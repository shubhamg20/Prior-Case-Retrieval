A former abuse of trust cannot be pleaded against a trustee who seeks to prevent a repetition of that abuse even if he were formerly implicated in the same indefensible course against which he is seeking to protect the trust property <NAME> <NAME> Mad There was no issue on estoppel that question has been raised here for the first time To validate such a custom would tend to public mischief in inducing needy incumbents of hereditary religions offices who desire to sell them to give a dishonest recognition to qualifications which in fact were not the qualifications demanded by the nature of the office The offerings made by Hindus to a public shrine constitute a public trust in which the trustee can never have any beneficiary interest and any appropriation by them of the same would be a clear breach of trust no custom recognising such appropriation can alter the character of such a transaction or validate the same which lays down the rule that shebaits cannot bequeath their office by will to non shebaits There is great danger in developing superficial analogies As a foreclosure decree can only he made with respect to mortgages of immoveable property the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act which refer to foreclosure of mortgages of immoveable property only and Order of the Civil Procedure Code of applying also to mortgages of immoveable property are inapplicable to mortgages of palas There is no provision of Indian Law for granting a decree for foreclosure in the case of pledge or mortgage of moveables There is also authority for the proposition that alienation of a religious office may be validly made in favour of a person standing in the line of succession and not disqualified by personal unfitness <NAME> <NAME> Bom This raises the question whether the custom possesses the characteristics deemed essential for the validity of a custom There is no force in the contention that the proof of the existence of the custom should have been carried back by direct evidence to when the first Regulations were passed by <ORG> if not to the year when <ORG> was established not only ought the <ORG> to be slow to draw an inference of fact which would defeat a right that has been exercised during so long a period as the present unless such inference is irresistible but it ought to presume everything possible to presume in favour of such a right In any event it is well settled that if the existence of the custom has been proved for a long period the onus lies on the person seeking to disprove the custom to demonstrate its impossibility in this case the mortgagors have entirely failed to meet the evidence of the custom adduced by the plaintiff There is also no room for serious controversy as regards the certainty and continuity of the custom It is indisputable that if a custom be against reason it has no force in law but as explained in Co When however it is said that a custom is void because it is unreasonable nothing more is meant than that the unreasonable character of the alleged custom conclusively proves that the usage even though it may have existed from time immemorial must have resulted from accident or indulgence and not from any right conferred in ancient times There is no force in the contention of the respondents that because the custom contravenes the rule that a religious office is inalienable it must be pronounced to be against public policy if this argument were to prevail all customs would be unreasonable Since customs in general involve some inconsistency with the general common law of the realm or are contrary to a particular maxim the fact of this inconsistency is not of itself a ground for holding the custom unreasonable and bad <NAME> <NAME> A It is not material to consider whether he should not apply the whole of the income for religious and charitable purposes but let us assume that he and every shebait like him who has a pala may be compelled to do so There is also no question that though probably religious offices were originally indivisible they are now deemed partible <NAME> <NAME> I Bam There is further no question that a pala has not only been deemed heritable and partible it has also been treated as devisable as is illustrated by the case of the Mister of the first defendant who obtained a pala under the testamentary devise of her father This again involves the recognition of the transferable character of a pala the exercise of thy right to make a bequest implies an assertion of the right to make a transfer inter vivos It follows consequently that the customary right to make a sale mortgage gift or lease of a pala in favour of persons within a limited circle is closely associated with and possibly developed out of the heritable devisable and partible character of a pala As regards the third question it has been argued on behalf of the mortgagors respondents that as Order of the Civil Procedure Code of applies only to mortgages of immoveable property the plaintiff is not entitled to a decree for foreclosure and in this connection reference has been made to <NAME> <NAME> I Calc There is no substance in this contention is in a very different position from an ordinary mortgagee as he has only a special property in the thing pledged and may obtain a sale but not a foreclosure The result is that this appeal is allowed and the decree of the District Judge discharged The hearing fee in this <ORG> is assessed at thirty gold mohurs I agree with the proposed order on the second ground discussed by my learned brother On the question of estoppel I prefer to reserve my opinion
