HEADNOTE The respondent landlord of a hotel filed a suit for eviction of his tenant appellant under proviso and of the Delhi and Ajmer Rent Control Act on the allegation that the appellant had sub let several rooms The suit was decreed which <ORG> in appeal maintained HELD The landlord was entitled to the decree for eviction There can be no waiver unless the person against whom the waiver is claimed had full knowledge of his rights and of facts enabling him to take effectual action for the enforcement of such rights It is said that the respondent knew of the sub lettings as be frequently visited the hotel up to and he must have known of the occupation of some of the occupants Appeal from the judgment and decree dated July of <ORG> in Regular First Appeal No of The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This appeal arises out of a suit for ejectment instituted by a landlord against a tenant in any other law or any contract no decree or order for the recovery of possession of any premises shall be passed by any Court in favour of the landlord against any tenant including a tenant whose tenancy is terminated Provided that nothing in this sub section shall apply to any suit or other proceeding for such recovery of possession if the Court is satisfied that the tenant without obtaining the consent of the landlord in writing has after the commencement of this Act i sub let assigned or otherwise parted with the possession of the whole or any part of the premises or ii used the premises for a purpose other than that for which they were let or that the tenant without obtaining the consent of the landlord has before the commencement of this Act i sub let assigned or otherwise parted with the possession of the whole or any part of the premises or ii used the premises for a purpose other than that for which they were let or that the tenant has whether before or after the commencement of this Act caused or permitted to be caused substantial damage to the premises or notwithstanding previous notice has used or dealt with the premises in a manner contrary to any condition imposed on the landlord by the <ORG> or <ORG> while giving him a lease of the land on which the premises are situated The respondent constructed the building known as the Hotel Imperial New Delhi on land leased to him by the Secretary of <ORG> for India in Council under a perpetual lease deed dated July By a deed dated August he leased to the appellant the hotel premises together with fittings and furniture for a term of years commencing on September On January the respondent instituted the present suit alleging that in breach of the express conditions of the lease dated August the appellant sub let portions of the premises and made unauthorised additions and alterations in the premises that on such breaches he was entitled to determine the lease and he did so by notice in writing dated January The appellant filed its written statement on April denying most of the material allegations in the plaint On April <NAME> counsel for the appellant made the following statement before <ORG> The plaintiff can seek ejectment of the defendant only under section of Act of section of the Rent Act the defendant would not seek any protection under the terms of the lease deed dated th August executed between the parties as regards the period of lease fixed therein using and dealing with the tenancy premises in a manner contrary to the conditions imposed on the plaintiff by the Government while giving him lease of the site of the tenancy premises Whether the defendant is entitled to sublet any part of the hotel premises even when there was a clause to the contra in the lease dated the th August and in face of statutory provisions under the Rent Control Act for reasons given in para of the amended written statement A tenant holding premises under a subsisting lease is pro tected by the lease and needs no protection under the Rent Act Thus the only questions in issue between the parties was whether the appellant was entitled to protection from eviction under and whether any ground for eviction under the Act was made out We have come to this conclusion after a close examination of the pleadings particulars statement of counsel issues and the judgment of <ORG> No issue was raised on the question whether the breaches of the express conditions of the lease had been waived by the respondent and whether the lease was still subsisting The appellant sought to raise this plea in <ORG> and also in this Court Having regard to the deliberate stand taken by the appellant in <ORG> the appellant cannot be allowed to raise the plea at a later stage Had the appellant taken the plea that the lease had not determined by forfeiture on the date of the institution of the suit it is possible that the respondent might have filed another suit for ejectment of the appellant immediately after September Because of the stand taken by the appellant it was not necessary for the respondent to file another suit The respondent is entitled to a decree for eviction if any of the grounds mentioned in cls With regard to the ground of eviction mentioned in cl <ORG> held that the appellant was entitled to relief on certain conditions <ORG> however held that the respondent was entitled to an unconditional decree for eviction on the ground of sub letting mentioned in cls The appellant preferred an appeal to <ORG> The appellant produced several documents in <ORG> at an early stage of the suit The surprising feature of the case is that the appellant did not attempt to prove any of the documents It was for the appellant to prove the written agreements and the <ORG> could then construe them The documents formed part of the appellant case The argument is that as the landlord is living in the premises that fact raises the presumption that he intends to retain the control of the whole of the premises and that the occupation of the other parts is that of a lodger or inmate and not that of a tenant and reliance was placed on <NAME> <ORG> and the cases referred to therein ment he has not in law an exclusive occupation and is therefore in the position of a licensee if the landlord retains the general control and dominion of the house including the part occupied by the lodger but if in fact the landlord exercises no control over that part the occupier is a tenant On the question whether the occupier of a separate apartment in a premises is a licensee or a tenant the test is has the landlord retained control over the apartment The fact that the apartment is a room in a hotel may lead to the inference that the hotel keeper retains the general dominion of the en tire hotel including the apartment and that the occupier is in the position of a lodger or inmate In the Courts below the appellant made no attempt to prove these documents We found no ground for directing a new trial Having regard to all these facts we dismissed the application If the interest of the tenant of the hotel premises is determined the sub tenant to whom a room in the hotel has been lawfully sublet becomes under a direct tenant of the landlord It may be that when the sub tenant of a room in a hotel becomes a direct tenant under he enjoys the protection of the Act because the room is no longer a room in a hotel Reliance is placed on the correspondence passed between the Land Development Officer New Delhi and the respondent bet ween April and February for establishing that the respondent gave written consent to the sub lettings By his letters dated November and February the respondent requested <ORG> to regularise the matter adding that in an first class hotels counters of air lines and show rooms of jewellery and curios were always provided There can be no waiver unless the person against whom the waiver is claimed had full knowledge of his rights and of facts enabling him to take effectual action for the enforcement of such rights It appears that he visited the hotel up to and he must have known of the occupation of <NAME> <ORG> and <ORG> The Courts below held that the appellant had also sublet several counters show cases and garages to various persons We express no opinion on the question whether there was any sub letting of the counters show cases and garages The appellant had due notice of the conditions of the head lease We express no opinion on it and this question is left open In the result the appeal is dismissed with costs The appellant through Mr <NAME> gives an undertaking that the appellant will hand over to the respondent on the expiry of six months vacant possession of the entire hotel premises except the portion in the possession of sub lessees
