Words and Phrases Public interest What it means in the context of Motor Vehicles Act HEADNOTE A stage carriage under the Motor Vehicles Act means a motor vehicle which carries more than six persons for hire or reward at separate fares paid by or for individual passengers either for the whole journey or for stages of the journey and for plying such a vehicle it is necessary to obtain a permit from the appropriate <ORG> a to of sub of have regard to the interest of the public generally the advantages to the public of the service to be provided the adequacy of other passenger transport services operating between the places to be served the operation by the applicant of other transport services etc and also take into consideration the representations made by local or police authorities and by persons already providing passenger transport facilities by any means along or near the proposed route or area While sub thereof conferred power on <ORG> to issue directions of a general character in public interest in respect of any matter relating to road transport sub specifically conferred the power to issue directions regarding grant of stage carriage permits to all eligible applicants if <ORG> was of the opinion that it was in the public interest to do so Further under sub of A the provisions of stood amended to the effect that while considering an application for permit it was no longer necessary for the <ORG> to have regard to the adequacy of other passenger transport services operating between the places to be served or to the operation by the applicant of other transport services nor was the <ORG> required to look into representations made by any one other than local or police authorities The Statement of objects and Reasons appended to the Amending Act stated that it had become necessary to reconsider the policy of granting bus permits liberally with a view to checking unproductive capital expenditure and unnecessary consumption of fuel preventing elimination of small operators as a consequence of unreasonable competition etc and authorising <ORG> to issue necessary directions from time to time in regard to the number of permits that may be granted in respect of any route or area the preference to be given to specifically deserving categories etc The proviso to sub of was amended by providing that in addition to a registered cooperative society an application for a stage carriage permit from a person who has a valid licence for driving transport vehicles shall he given preference over applications from individual owners These amendments came into force on January On January <ORG> issued a notification directing <ORG> to issue stage carriage permits to all eligible applicants and specifying that there should be no upper limit to the number of stage carriages for which permits might be granted a and of sub of and to take into consideration representations made by local or police authorities only According to the High <ORG> the question of reservation would arise only in those cases where the seats or articles are limited for distribution or allotment but where there is no limit or no fixed number the question of reservation would not arise Allowing the appeals HELD Whenever a court is called upon to interpret an amended provision it has to bear in mind the history of the provision the mischief which the legislature attempted to remedy the remedy provided by the amendment and the reason for providing such remedy After the amendment sub of A did not comprehend within its scope the power to issue directions for issuing permits to all eligible applicants without any sort of restriction relevant to the scheme of the Act The sub section states that <ORG> may issue such directions of a general character as it may consider necessary in the public interest It takes within its fold several factors such as the maximum number of permits that may be Issued on a route or in any area having regard to the needs and convenience of the travelling public the non availability of sufficient number of stage carriages in other routes or areas which may be in need of running of additional services the problems of law and order availability of fuel etc The Act itself contains provisions relating to licensing of drivers and conductors specifications of motor vehicles co ordination of road and rail transport prevention of deterioration of road system prevention of Uneconomic competition among motor vehicles etc Any direction given by <ORG> under A should therefore be in conformity with all matters regarding which the statute has made provision A A In the instant case a reading of the two notifications shows that <ORG> ignored the legislative policy underlying the Act of by which the new sub of A was enacted in substitution of the former sub with retrospective effect The High <ORG> erred in not noticing that by issuing the notification containing a direction to <ORG> to issue limitless number of permits <ORG> had attempted to circumvent sub ss The observation of the High <ORG> that preferences have to be shown and reservations have to be made only when there is scarcity of permits and since there were no restrictions on the number of permits to be issued there was no necessity to make any such provision is shocking Preference and reservations have value only when there is a limit on the number of permits to be issued and in the context of the Act there should necessarily be a limit on the issue of permits to operate motor vehicles in respect of any route or area Whatever the <ORG> may have observed while considering that provision would not apply now as There is a clear departure made by the legislature from that policy when it enacted the new sub of A In the face of this amendment by which the former sub of A which specifically authorised <ORG> when it was satisfied that it was necessary to do so in the public interest to issue directions to <ORG> to grant permits to all eligible applicants was deliberately taken away by the State legislature the High <ORG> was wrong in holding that such power was still available under sub of A which was widely worded The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> In these appeals by special leave filed against the common judgment dated March of <ORG> the validity of two Notifications issued by <ORG> under section A of the Motor Vehicles Act Act IV of hereinafter referred to as the Act as in force in the State of Uttar Pradesh arises for consideration Whereas <ORG> is of opinion that it is in the

stage carriage permit have regard to the following matters namely a the interest of the public generally the advantage to the public of the service to be provided including the saving of time likely to be effected thereby and any convenience arising from journeys not being broken the benefit to any particular locality or localities likely to be afforded by the service and shall also take into consideration any representation made by any local authority or police authority within whose jurisdiction any part of the proposed route or area lies and sub section were omitted The above Act was preceded by the Ordinance which contained more or less the same provisions The object of enacting section A of the Act was set out in the Statement of objects and Reasons attached to the relevant Bill which read as follows Objects and Reasons operators engage in the race for securing permits for stage carriage on non nation alised routes Due to limitation on the number of permits this business is controlled by a few persons Therefore with a view to making it easier to secure permits in respect of non nationalised routes and to introducing simplicity in procedure and to providing greater employment and securing equitable distribution thereof it was considered necessary to amend sections SO SS and of the Motor Vehicles Act suitably Pursuant to the power conferred on it by section A of the Act <ORG> issued the following directions on March by a Notification the relevant part of which reads as under Whereas <ORG> is of opinion that it is in the public interest to grant stage carriage permits except in respect of routes or areas for which schemes have been published under section of the Motor Vehicles Act contract carriage permits and public carrier permits to all eligible applicants Now therefore in exercise of the power conferred by section A of the Motor Vehicles Act the Governor is pleased to direct that stage carriage permits except in respect of routes or areas aforesaid contract carriage permits and public carrier permits shall be granted according to the provisions of the said Act to all eligible applicants Accor dingly the State Government issued a Notification on September which ran as follows Whereas in exercise of the power conferred by Section A of the Motor Vehicles Act <ORG> was by notification No XXX dated March pleased to direct that stage carriage permits except in respect of routes or areas aforesaid contract carriage permits and public carrier permits shall be granted according to the provisions of the said Act to all eligible applicants And whereas on further consideration <ORG> is of opinion that the policy of granting such permits to all eligible applicants requires review with a view to a Preventing unproductive expenditure and under utilization of capital and fuel Now therefore in exercise of the powers conferred by the said Section A of the Motor Vehicles Act read with Section of the General Clauses Act the Governor is pleased to direct that The consideration of applications for stage carriage permits pending with <ORG> shall stand postponed until further directions are issued in this behalf by the State Government No fresh applications for such permits shall be entertained until further directions are issued in this behalf by <ORG> The above Notification shows that as a consequence of the policy of granting permits to all eligible applicants necessity had arisen to take measures i to prevent unproductive expenditure and under utilisation of capital and fuel ii to prevent elimination of small operators due to unfair competition resulting from the issue of more permits than required for a route and iii to embark upon long term planning of passenger road transport services Power of State Government to issue directions to Transport Authorities The State Government may issue such directions of a general character as it may consider necessary or expedient in the public interest in respect of any matter relating to road transport to <ORG> or to <ORG> and such Transport Authority shall give effect to all such directions Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions of sub section such directions may be given in respect of any of the following matters namely a the number of stage carriage or contract carriage permits that may be granted in respect of any route or area the preference or the order of preference to be given to or the quota to be fixed for specially deserving categories such as <ORG> personnel educated unemployed persons such persons holding driving licences as are members of cooperative societies formed for passenger transport business persons belonging to the Scheduled castes and Scheduled Tribes the procedure for grant of permits and for selection from among the applicants including selection by drawing of lots from among persons belonging to the same category Where any direction is issued under sub section to <ORG> then any appeal or revision pending before <ORG> shall also be decided in such manner as to give effect to such directions Where any direction is issued under sub section with retrospective effect then a <ORG> or <ORG> may review any order passed earlier by it with a view to making it conform to such direction and may for that purpose cancel any permit already issued The provisions of this section shall have effect not withstanding anything contained in sections and Reconsideration of the said policy however became necessary with a view to checking unproductive capital expenditure and unnecessary consumption of fuel and preventing the elimination of small operators as a consequence of unreasonable competition and to removing difficulties in the implementation of long term plans pertaining to passenger road transport services It was accordingly considered necessary to amend the Motor Vehicles Act to authorise <ORG> to issue directions from time to time in regard to the number of permits that may be granted in respect of any route or area the preference to be given to specially deserving categories and the procedure for grant of permits Pursuant to the said amended section A of the Act <ORG> issued a Notification containing directions on March in the following terms Whereas in exercise of the powers conferred by section A of the Act <ORG> had by a notification No XXX dated September as amended by notification No XXX dated October postponed the consideration of applications for permits by any transport authority in respect of non notified routes until further directions in this behalf of <ORG> Now therefore in exercise of the powers conferred by the said section A of the Act read with section of the General Clauses Act the Governor is pleased to direct That the A and As while fixing the number of Additional Stage Carriage permits to be issued at a given time on non notified routes shall in addition to the consideration of the matter mentioned in sub section of section of the Act ensure that the operation of the total number of stage carriages on any route taking into consideration the existing as well as the additional permits proposed to be issued would be economically viable on the existing fare structure as per the norms as laid down by <ORG> from time to time The above notification also contained directions regarding the principle to be followed in determining the number of permits that could be issued and reservation of permits for operators displaced by nationalisation educated unemployed members belonging to the Scheduled Castes the Scheduled Tribes and other backward classes unemployed army drivers and cooperative societies Provided that other conditions being equal an application for a stage carriage permit from a co operative society registered or deemed to have been registered under any enactment in force for the time being and an application for a stage carriage permit from a person who has a valid licence for driving transport vehicles shall as far as may be be given preference over applications from individual owners The reservation of permits under sub section A shall be in the same ratio as in the case of appointments made by direct recruitment to public services in the <ORG> The Government of a State may having regard to the extent to which persons belonging to economically weaker sections of the community have been granted stage carriage permits in that State a reserve in that State such percentage of stage carriage permits as may be prescribed for persons belonging to economically weaker sections of the community or notwithstanding anything contained in the proviso to sub section give preference in such manner as may be prescribed to applications for stage carriage permits from such person Explanation I In this section and in sections and a person shall be deemed to belong to economically weaker section of the community if and only if on the prescribed date a the annual income of such person together with the annual income if any of the members of his family or the extent of land whether in one class or in different classes held by such person together with that if any held by the members of his family or the annual income and the extent of land aforesaid does or do not exceed such limit as may be prescribed For the purposes of Explanation I family in relation to an individual means the wife or husband as the case may be of such individual and the minor children of such individual The number of permits reserved under sub section and clause a of sub section shall not exceed fifty per cent of the total number of stage carriage permits granted during a calendar year In giving effect to the provisions of sub section and clause a of sub section <ORG> or <ORG> may if it considers necessary or expedient so to do group the various routes within its jurisdiction Where any stage carriage permit is to be granted from the quota reserved under sub section or clause a of sub section to any cooperative society registered or deemed to have been registered under any enactment in force for the time being or any firm to which the provisions of the Indian Partnership Act apply no permit shall be granted to such society or firm unless the members of the co operative society or the partners of the firm belong to the Scheduled Castes the Scheduled Tribes or economically weaker sections of the community Provided that where the members of such co operative society or the partners of such firm are partly from the Scheduled Castes partly from the Scheduled Tribes and partly from the economically weaker sections of the community or from any two of these categories any permit under this sub section shall be granted to such society or firm only from the quota reserved for the category to which the largest number of members of the co operative society or as the case may be partners of the firm belong Provided further that where no reservation has been made in the State for economically weaker sections of the community under clause a of sub section no permit under this sub section shall be granted to a co operative society or firm unless the members of such society or partners of such firm belong to the Scheduled Castes or the Scheduled Tribes or partly to the Scheduled Castes and partly to the Scheduled Tribes and the permit to such society or firm shall be granted only from the quota reserved for the Scheduled Castes or the Scheduled Tribes according as to whether the larger number of the members of the co operative society or partners of the firm belong to the Scheduled Castes or the Scheduled Tribes Notwithstanding anything contained in this section an application for stage carriage permit from a State transport undertaking for operating in any inter State route shall be given preference over all other applications Provided that the authority shall not grant a permit under this sub section unless it is satisfied that the State transport undertaking would be able to operate in the inter State route without detriment to its responsibility for providing efficient and adequate road transport service in any notified area or notified route as is referred to in sub section of section where the undertaking operates the service By the amendment of section of the Act as stated above <ORG> directed that <ORG> while considering applications for stage carriage permits should provided that other conditions being equal give preference to an application from a person who has a valid licence for driving transport vehicles over applications from individual owners <ORG> also provided for reservation of certain percentage of permits for state carriages in favour of persons belonging to the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes in the same ratio as in the case of appointments made by direct recruitment by a State Government to public services in that State Since it was considered necessary to promote the well being of economically weaker sections of the community <ORG> was empowered under certain circumstances either to reserve certain percentage of permits for stage carriages for persons belonging to economically weaker sections of the community or to give preference to them in the prescribed manner It was however provided that the number of permits reserved under section and a of the Act should not exceed fifty per cent of the total number of stage carriage permits granted in a calendar year It was also provided that if <ORG> applied for a stage carriage permit operating in any inter State route such application should be given preference over all other applications provided the authority we satisfied that the <ORG> would be able to operate in the inter State route without detriment to its responsibility for providing efficient and adequate road transport service in any notified area or notified route as is referred to in sub section of section of the Act where the <ORG> operated its service By the very same amending Act of <ORG> also amended section of the Act by inserting clauses ci cii ciii and civ enabling <ORG>s to frame rules for implementing subsections A to of section of the Act The above said amendments made to sections and came into force on January It is conceded by the learned Attorney General who appeared for <ORG> that these amendments which were made by <ORG> would have an over riding effect on section A of the Act introduced earlier by <ORG> and that section A should be read subject to those later amendments made by <ORG> By the first notification <ORG> directed <ORG> of the State of Uttar Pradesh to issue stage carriage permits except in respect of routes or areas for which schemes had been published under section of the Act to all eligible applicants and that there should be no upper limit to the number of stage carriages for which permits might be provided By the second impugned notification dated January <ORG> directed <ORG> and <ORG> to have regard only to matters referred to in clauses a and of sub section of section of the Act and should also take into consideration representation made by the local authority or police authority within whose jurisdiction any part of the proposed route or area lay It also directed that section should be deemed to have been complied with if <ORG> concerned intimated the particulars of the applications to such local authority and police authority for making representations if any within a period of fifteen days from the date of despatch of the intimation with the stipulation that if no representation was received within the prescribed period of time it would be presumed that they had no representation to make and considered any representation made by such local authority and police authority A reading of these two notifications shows that <ORG> ignored first the legislative policy underlying the Uttar Pradesh Act of by which the new sub section of section A was enacted in substitution of the former sub section with retrospective effect It was argued on behalf of <ORG> before <ORG> that <ORG> not contravened either section A or the provisions of section as amended in the year <ORG> upheld the notification dated January and further observed that since the schemes of grant of free permits had been upheld by it <ORG> had the power to prescribe the procedure to be followed in granting the same which has been provided for by the Notification dated January Repelling the contention of the writ petitioners that in the absence of reservation of the required percentage of permits for persons belonging to the Scheduled Castes the Scheduled Tribes and weaker sections as provided in section as amended by <ORG> in the grant of permits would be vitiated <ORG> observed as follows The question of reservation however arises only in those cases where the seats or articles are limited for distribution or allotment but where there is no limit or no fixed number the question of reserved on will not arise A member of the Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe as well as economically weaker section of the community would as much be entitled to get a permit to run his vehicle as a member of any other community So we are not able to agree with the submission of the petitioner learned counsel that there is a conflict between section A as inserted by <ORG> and the amendments made in section by <ORG> in the Motor Vehicles Act of section A which authorised <ORG> to issue such directions of a general character as it might consider necessary or expedient in the public interest in respect of any matter relating to road transport to <ORG> or to <ORG> and which required such authority to give effect to any such directions <ORG> also relied upon the decision of this Court in <NAME> case supra to hold that larger number of buses operating on different routes would be for the convenience and benefit of the travelling public We may here state that any observations made in <NAME> case supra would be inapplicable so far as these cases presently before us are concerned That sub section provided that without prejudice to the generality of the power contained in section A of the Act where <ORG> was of opinion that it was in public interest to grant stage carriage permits except in respect of routes or areas for which schemes have been published under section or contract carriage permits or public carrier permits to all eligible applicants it may issue appropriate directions as stated therein Without saying anything more on the point it may be stated that whatever this <ORG> may have observed while considering that provision would not apply now as there is a clear departure made by the <ORG> from that policy when it enacted the new sub section of section A In the face of this amendment by which the former sub section of section A which specifically authorised he State Government when it was satisfied that it was necessary to do so in the public interest to issue directions to the Transport Authorities to grant permits to all eligible applicants was deliberately taken away by the State <ORG> the High <ORG> was wrong in holding that such power was still available under sub section of section A of the Act which was widely worded Even without the aid of the Statement of objects and Reasons it has to be held that by the substitution of the former sub section by the new sub section in section A the <ORG> clearly expressed itself against the policy of granting permits to all eligible applicants without any consideration to the needs of any particular locality or route or to the qualification of applicants It is a well settled rule of construction of statutes that whenever a court is called upon to interpret an amended provision it has to bear in mind the history of that provision the mischief which the <ORG> attempted to remedy the remedy provided by the amendment and the reason for providing such remedy Therefore after the amendment at any rate it has to be held that sub section of section A of the Act did not comprehend within its scope the power to issue direction for issuing permits to all eligible applicants without any sort of restriction relevant to the scheme of the Act What does section A after all say It says that <ORG> may issue such directions of a general character as it may consider necessary in the public interest What is the meaning of the term public interest In the context of the Act it takes within its fold several factors such as the maximum number of permits that may be issued on a route or in any area having regard to the needs and convenience of the travelling public the non availability of sufficient number of stage carriage services in other routes or areas which may be in need of running of additional services the problems of law and order availability of fuel problems arising out of atmospheric pollution caused by a large number of motor vehicles operating in any route or area the condition of roads and bridges on the routes uneconomic running of stage carriage services leading to elimination of small operators and employment of more capital than necessary in any sector leading to starvation of capital investment in other sectors etc We nave to bear in mind that like every other economic activity the running of stage carriage service is an activity which involves use of scarce or limited productive resources If we run through the various provisions of the Act it becomes clear how much attention is given by it to various matters affecting public interest There are provisions relating to licensing of drivers on the basis of their competence licensing of conductors specifications to which the motor vehicles should conform coordination of road and rail transport prevention of deterioration of the road system prevention of uneconomic competition among motor vehicles fixation of reasonable fare compliance by motor vehicles with the prescribed time table construction of bus stands with necessary amenities maintenance of standards of comfort and cleanliness in the vehicles development of <ORG> tourist traffic and several other matters with the object of making available adequate and efficient transport facilities to all parts of the country Any direction given by <ORG> under section A of the Act should therefore be in conformity with all matters regarding which the statute has made provision It is surprising that <ORG> has reached the conclusion that the preferences and reservations to be observed while granting permits as stated in the proviso to sub section to section and in sub sections A to of section have not been contravened as there is no restriction on the number of permits to be issued The observation of <ORG> that preferences have to be shown and reservations have to be made only when there is scarcity of permits and since there are no restrictions on the number of permits to be issued there is no necessity to make any such provision really shocks us <ORG> erred in not noticing that it was dealing with a vital economic activity which could be carried on at a huge cost both to the operator and to the <ORG> and that by issuing the notification containing a direction to <ORG> to issue limitless number of permits the State <ORG> had attempted to circumvent sub sections and A to of section of the Act Preferences and reservations have value only when there is a limit on the number of permits to be issued and in the context of the Act there should necessarily he a limit on the issue of permits to operate motor vehicles in respect of any route or area We do not agree with the above submission We are clearly of the view that the State <ORG> has transgressed the provisions contained in sub section and sub sections A to of section It has failed to comply with the duty imposed on it by those provisions The first notification which directs that all eligible applicants shall be granted permits and that there shall be no upper limit to the number of permits to be issued for stage carriages and the second notification which says that <ORG> shall have regard only to matters referred to in clauses a and of sub section of section of the Act and thereby precludes <ORG> to take into consideration matters contained in the proviso to section and in sub section A to of section of the Act are ultra vires the Act and they are liable to he struck down We therefore allow these appeals set aside the judgment of <ORG> in each of these cases and declare that the Notification No XXX KM dated January and the Notification No XXX dated January issued by the GoverDmeDt of the State of Uttar Pradesh under section A of the Act are ultra vires and therefore void and ineffective
