The tenancy was terminated and the plaintiff laid the suit for ejectment of the defendant Apart from other contentions the defendant raised a plea that the suit for ejectment is not maintainable in view of the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Buildings Lease and Rent Control Act hereinafter referred to as the Act The plaintiff counteracted this defence of the defendant by stating that the building was completed only in March and as per Section i of the Act nothing in the Act shall apply to any building for a period of five years from the date on which the construction is completed and notified to the local authority concerned The defendant appealed in A No of which Was heard and disposed of by a Bench of this Court consisting of <NAME> and <NAME> JJ The learned Judges considered it unnecessary at that stage to go into the question as to whether any decree that may be passed in the suit is executable or not in view of the provisions of Section of the Act as that question will arise only at the stage of the execution after the decree is passed The learned Judges expressing an opinion that the first court was in error in going into that question at that stage set aside that finding of the court below and without going into the question of the executability of the decree the decree for ejectment was confirmed leaving it open to the defendant to agitate the The defendant apart from contesting the execution for delivery of possession took out A No of under Section of the Code of Civil Procedure to declare that the decree passed in the suit is not executable in view of the provisions of the Act This revision is preferred against the order passed by the Court below in Mr <NAME> learned Counsel for the defendant would submit that even prior to the date of the decree in the suit and pending the suit the exemption under Section of the Act had lapsed and even though the jurisdiction of <ORG> to pass a decree is not ousted on the lapse of the exemption the Act became applicable to the premises in question and when the execution came to be levied the provisions of the Act squarely applied and there could not be an eviction of the defendant who has become a tenant within the meaning of the Act except under the provisions of the Act Learned Counsel further submits that with or without the exemption the jurisdiction of <ORG> to pass a decree in ejectment even against a tenant within the meaning of the Act is not ousted and this proposition has emerged from the judicial precedents rendered under the Rent Control Statute which prevailed and which is prevailing in this State and the only inhibition is with reference to evicting the tenant in execution of such a decree or otherwise except through the processes under the Act and on the conditions set out therein getting satisfied therefor and when the execution came to be levied in respect of the decree the Act had come to be applied to the premises in question and the decree could not be availed of to evict the defendant who is a tenant within the meaning of the act As against this Mr <NAME> learned Counsel appearing for the plaintiff would heavily rely on the pronouncement of <NAME> <NAME> referred to above to state that the decree obtained by the plaintiff can be executed though the period of five years under Section of the Act had expired by the time the decree was granted and the execution proceedings initiated The contentions raised by the respective counsel oblige me to bestow some serious attention on the case law on the subject including that which has arisen in similar contingencies under the Act itself or under similar statutes current and prevailing anterior to the enactment of the Act It says that nothing in the Act shall apply to any building for a period of five years from the date on which the construction is completed and notified to the local authority concerned By this exemption the application of the Act gets postponed for a period of five years and the Act comes into force so far as this building is concerned only after the lapse of the five years The first principle to construe an exemption provision is that it should be properly and strictly construed against the person who claims it Chandrasekhara Aiyar held that there was an ouster of jurisdiction of Civil Courts and the remedy of the plaintiff was to go before the Controller <NAME> dealt with a case where the landlord had after giving notice filed a suit for evicting a tenant and had obtained a decree therein and levied execution for delivery prior to the amendment of the House Rent Control Order prescribing that a tenant could not be evicted except under an order of the Rent Controller and the learned Judge held that the landlord right to execute the decree was not taken away by the amendment which came into force subsequent to the application to execute the decree <NAME> after referring to the decision of <NAME> summed up the proposition in the following terms and when an application for possession comes before the Controller the Controller should apply his mind to the circumstances actually present before him to enable him to make or refuse an order and it would be for one side or the other to point out that the application for ejectment had lost its force owing to the fact that since the application had been made difficulties which were then not in existence had arisen or difficulties that were in existence had disappeared was relied on but the learned Judge did not accept the same and held that the wording of the section is not such as to deprive <ORG> of their power to entertain the suit for eviction and to adjudicate upon it and what the Control Order prohibits is eviction outside the provisions of Section A of the Order once again dealt with a similar contention and repelled the same holding that It cannot be said that these words are wide enough to deprive <ORG> of their jurisdiction to pass decrees all that the rule contemplates is the control of the relief of eviction <NAME> was dealing with a case where the suit for ejectment was pending when the Madras Non Residential Building Rent Control Order was amended However an ex parte decree was passed subsequently and the property itself was delivered to the plaintiff landlord in execution proceedings The District Munsif upheld the contention of the defendant that under Section of the Amended Non Residential Buildings Rent Control Order a tenant could not be evicted and accordingly held that the previous order directing delivery was wrong and the court had jurisdiction to set aside that order and to order re delivery as the execution petition had not been closed and the proceedings were still pending before the <ORG> The decree holder appealed and the appellate <ORG> also agreed with the first <ORG> on this question <NAME> construed the expressions in execution of a decree or otherwise occurring in Section of the Control Order and held that it would have reference to a decree in a suit instituted after the amendment and the learned Judge declined to construe the section retrospectively and further held as follows If there is nothing else in the enactment to indicate that every pending legislation or pre existing substantive rights of parties were intended to be affected by the amended Order I must hold in accordance with the well established rules of construction of statutes that the amended Control Order Section Clauses and had no application to the present execution petition and that the order for delivery originally made was right and proper <NAME> points out that unless either by express or by necessary intendment it is made out in the new legislation that it applies to pending proceedings as well it ought not to be construed to have retrospective operation so as to affect the rights of parties in pending suits A I The learned Judge further observed that the Order itself is only for a short duration and if and when it is repealed or it expires without being renewed the previous decree of <ORG> will have to be executed by the civil court as in ordinary cases In the result the learned Judge allowed the civil miscellaneous second appeal The learned Judges adverted to the fact that execution proceedings were filed long after the amendment came into force and that they are not concerned with the applicability of the new law to pending proceedings The contention before the Bench was that the moment a person files a suit he obtains thereby a vested right to have applied not only to the suit but to all execution proceedings also the law relating to execution as it existed at the time of filing the suit The Bench repelled the said contention observing as follows We know of no such principle and we find no reason to think from the cases that have been cited before us that if a new law is introduced restricting the right to execute execution proceedings can nevertheless be instituted if such a right existed on the date of the filing of the suit Atica Begum in which a reference was made to certain English cases interpreting British statutes said to be similar to the statute under consideration and the learned Judges declared that they have not seen those decisions of statutes and they are not at all convinced that any such general principle exists and after adverting to the passage in the judgment of <NAME> <NAME> supra opined that <NAME> far from thinking that a landlord had by the institution of the application for possession in <ORG> acquired an absolute right to physical possession contemplated proceedings before the Rent Controller in which it would be contended by the tenant that in view of the new legislation actual possession could not be given the Bench summed up the proposition by stating that the jurisdiction of a civil court to entertain and pass a decree in a suit for eviction by the landlord against the tenant was not expressly or impliedly taken away by the provisions of the Rent Control Order and in this view the Bench dismissed the civil miscellaneous appeal before it There is no taking away of the jurisdiction of <ORG> but only an imposition of restrictions in regard to the mode of execution <NAME> and <NAME> dealt with the case of a decree on compromise passed in a suit instituted by the landlord against the tenant for recovery of possession of the property The order for delivery was made in execution on th April directing delivery by th June As against this order there was an appeal and the order of delivery was stayed ex parte on th April On th July the appeal was dismissed upholding the order of delivery and the appellate court apparently taking the view that Section of the Madras Buildings Lease and Rent Control Act would not make the original order for possession ipso factc invalid but it might be that the Judgment debtor could object to actual eviction in pursuance of the order It must be pointed out that earlier on th June the Rent Control Act got extended to the village where the property was situated The legal representative of the deceased landlord decree holder filed ah application also on th July to be added as a legal representative and praying for an order directing delivery of possession The ground taken by the tenant was that the Rent Control Act having been extended to the village in which the property was situated on and from th June the legal representative of the landlord decree holder could not evict him Against this order of the District Munsif the tenant filed an appeal which was heard and disposed of by the Subordinate Judge who dismissed the appeal on the ground that Section of the Act could not apply to pending execution proceedings that is to say the prior execution petition wherein an order for eviction had already been passed Against this order the tenant preferred an appeal to this Court which came up for decision before <NAME> The learned Judge held that Section of the Act did apply and was a complete answer to the claim of the legal representative of the landlord decree holder to evict the tenant and hence the appeal was allowed and the execution petition filed by the legal representative of the landlord decree holder was dismissed The Bench found as per the facts above that though there was an order of eviction in a prior execution petition the tenant could not be evicted in pursuance of that order and that was why the subsequent execution petition was filed on th July and it was filed after the Rent Control Act had come into operation in the village in which the property was situated the Bench observed as follows It was contended before <ORG> that the moment a person files a suit he obtains thereby a vested right to have applied not only to the suit but to all execution proceedings also the law relating to execution as it existed at the time of filing the suit The learned Judges had no difficulty in rejecting this contention as they were not aware of any such principles They found no reason to think that if a new law is introduced restricting the right to execute execution proceedings can nevertheless be instituted if such a right existed on the date of the filing of the suit No doubt there is a reference to pending proceedings in one part of the judgment but it was not necessary to deal with the point because they held that during the interval between the passing of the decree and the filing of the execution petition there was no pending proceeding The basis of the decision is certainly against the view that Clause would not affect pending proceedings Referring to the observations of <NAME> in <NAME> <NAME> A I Mad extracted supra the Bench expressed the view as follows We must confess we are not able to fully appreciate the scope of these observations Ultimately the Bench countenanced the principle that the executing <ORG> is bound to apply the provisions in the statute which had come into force even before the date of the execution petition which it was called upon to dispose The Bench also took note of the fact that it was not a case where during the pendency of an already filed execution petition the Rent Control Act came to be extended to the village in question and by the time of the filing of the concerned execution petition the Act had already come into force Section of the Mysore House Rent and Accommodation Control Order while giving liberty to the landlord to file a suit for eviction of a tenant before a competent <ORG> provided that no decree for eviction of a tenant passed by a <ORG> shall be executed unless a certificate to that effect is obtained from the Controller <ORG> referring to the contention that ignoring the above provisions is no more than an error in the exercise of jurisdiction observed as follows The contention raised that ignoring Sections and of the House Rent Control Order is no more than an error in the exercise of jurisdiction does not appear to be sound because those sections are a fetter on the executability of the decree and not merely an error in the exercise of the jurisdiction In the present case the two sections mentioned above were a restriction on the power of the <ORG> to execute the decree and therefore this argument must also be rejected <ORG> confirmed the view of <ORG> that the executing Court had no jurisdiction to order the eviction of a tenant because of the provisions of the Mysore House Rent and Accommodation Control Order which was in operation on the date of eviction In exercise of the powers conferred by Section of the Punjab Urban Rent Restriction Act and all other powers enabling him in this behalf the Governor of Punjab is pleased to direct that the provisions of Section of the said Act shall not apply in respect of decrees for ejectment of tenants in possession of buildings which satisfy the following conditions namely a Buildings constructed during the years and are exempted from all the provisions of the said Act for a period of five years to be calculated from the dates of their completion and Section of the Punjab Act stated that a tenant in possession of a building or rented land shall not be evicted therefrom in execution of a decree passed before or after the commencement of the Act or otherwise and whether before or after the termination of the tenancy except in accordance with the provisions of that section On th August execution was levied which was dismissed on the ground that the notification of exemption could not apply It was contended before <ORG> that the decree having been passed after the lapse of the period of exemption the exemption from the restrictions placed by Section will not be available because not only the suit ought to have been filed but the decree for eviction ought to have been obtained within the period of exemption <ORG> pointed out that this contention on the face of it would lead to incongruity or would it accepted have the effect of nullifying the very purpose for which the exemption was being given The decree passed in such suits were held by <ORG> to be executable free from the fetters imposed by Section <ORG> took note of the fact that the buildings constructed in and had already been exempted from the provisions of Section by two earlier notifications and found that the notifications granted exemption to decrees in suits filed within the period of exemption though the decrees came to be passed after the lapse of such period It merely states that nothing in the Act shall apply to any building for a period of five years from the date on which the construction is completed and notified to local authority concerned In <ORG> <NAME> Appeal No dealt with a case where during the pendency of an appeal against a decree for ejectment Section of the Act was amended limiting the exemption for new buildings for a period of five years only in contract to the earlier permanent exemption of buildings constructed after the Act and on the ground that the period of five years had lapsed it was pleaded before the <ORG> that the decree ought to be set aside In <NAME> <NAME> Ismail as he then was dealt with a case where a decree was passed prior to the amendment to Section of the Act and taking advantage of the amendment limiting the period of exemption to new buildings only for a period of five years it was contended that the decree stood nullified This contention was repelled by the learned Judge holding that the decree was validily passed following the pronouncement of the Bench in <ORG> <NAME> The learned Judge also pointed out that It is one thing to hold that the decree passed by the Courts below was validly passed with jurisdiction and it is another thing to say whether the said decree can be executed or not in view of the particular provision of the Act In <NAME> <NAME> <ORG> dealt with a case where a suit for ejectment was filed taking advantage of Clause iii of Section of the Act prior to the amendment in which provided that nothing contained in the Act would apply to any non residential building the rental value of which on the date of the commencement of the Act as entered in the property tax assessment book of the municipal council district board panchayat or panchayat union council or <ORG> exceeded Rs Pending the suit an amendment was introduced by virtue of which Clause iii of Section was omitted and further Section of the Amendment Act provided that all proceedings instituted on the ground of exemption by virtue of Clause iii deleted shall abate <ORG> held that the suit will abate even if there was no express allegation in the plaint to the effect that the suit was instituted on the ground that the building was exempted under Clause iii of Section of the Act and the Act as such could apply to the building in question and the tenant became a statutory tenant and he could not be evicted except in accordance with the provisions of the Act ejectment came to be levied after the Pondicherry Buildings Lease and Rent Control Act came into force A contention that the suit itself was barred and the civil <ORG> had no jurisdiction to pass a decree In ejectment was negatived by this <ORG> in second appeal and the question as to whether reliance could be placed on the provisions of the Pondicherry Act was left open to the stage of execution of the decree When the question was raised in execution the tenant could not succeed and the executing <ORG> held that the decree was one passed before the enforcement of the Act to the area in question and that was no bar to the executability of the decree However during the pendency of the first appeal the Act was made applicable to the town where the building was situated and the tenant filed an application in the first court for a declaration that the decree cannot be executed The first court dismissed the application and on revision <NAME> <NAME> after adverting to the case law on the subject held that though the decree is not null and void yet a declaration regarding its non executability can be given But the decree cannot be executed so long as the Act remains in force On th January the tenant filed an application that the decree is not executable and the order of delivery obtained by the landlord was erroneous That application was dismissed by the first court and the matter came before the learned judge by way of a revision The learned Judge has opined that the institution of the suit before the expiry of the period of exemption would suffice the purpose and the lapse of the period by the time the decree or order in the proceedings is passed and further proceedings are taken thereafter to realise the benefits thereof would not take away the benefit of the decree or order so obtained The learned Judge has expressed his views in the following terms Where a new building is constructed and the construction thereof is notified to the local authority the building would be exempt from the operation of the provisions of the Act for a period of five years therefrom But on the other hand if within the period of five years proceedings are taken based on the exemption then even though by the time the decree or order in the proceedings is passed and further proceedings are taken thereafter to realise the benefits thereof the five years period had lapsed nevertheless the benefit of the decree or order so obtained would be available to the party who secured it The irremovability of the tenant from the premises in his occupation despite a decree except in accordance with an order under Section or to of the Act lost as a result of the exemption under Section of the Act is not restored statutorily in a case where the decree or order is passed after the expiry of five years or the execution is levied after that period There the landlord filed a suit for eviction and for other reliefs on the ground that the period of ten years had not lapsed on the date of suit The only point argued before <ORG> on a special leave petition was whether the premises which was not ten years old on the date of the suit and was exempted from the operation of the Act could be governed by it if ten years expired during the pendency of the litigation A contention was put forth that the <ORG> had to decide the case on the basis of cause of action that had accrued prior to the filing of the suit and not on a new cause of action The Supreme <ORG> ruled out that the moment the building becomes ten years old to be reckoned from the date of completion the Act would become applicable for the purpose of enabling the tenant to work out the rights under it While setting aside the order of <ORG> relating to eviction the case was sent back to the first court for it to apply the Act and to give the protection of the said Act to the tenant The discussion of the case law which has preceded and my assessment thereof oblige me to take note of the following indisputable propositions The Act as such does not oust the jurisdiction of <ORG> to entertain a suit for eviction by a landlord against a tenant and the passing of a decree in such a suit A decree validly passed would still be unexecutable on account of the law that is prevailing or which comes into force at the relevant point of time The filing of the suit in <ORG> during the period of exemption and the obtaining of a decree in such a suit even during or after the lapse of the period of exemption is of no consequence at all and if at the time the decree is put into execution to evict the tenant the Act has intervened and come into force that alone would govern The courts are not concerned with the policy of the legislature or with the result whether injurious or otherwise by giving effect to the language used nor is it the function of the Court where the meaning is clear act to give effect to it merely because it would lead to hardship This categoric pronouncement of <ORG> settles the law beyond any ambiguity In the present case I am not called upon to decide this question specifically because it does not arise on facts I make no order as to costs
