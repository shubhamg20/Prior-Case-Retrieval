DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH <NAME> <NAME> JUDGMENT I CIVIL APPEAL NO OF SINHA These two appeals arising out of a common judgment and order dated passed by <ORG> at Jammu were taken up for hearing together and are being disposed of by this common judgment Interpretation of a bipartite settlement dated is in question in these appeals which arise out of the aforementioned judgment and order passed by a Division Bench of the said court dismissing an appeal preferred by <ORG> hereinafter referred to as the Bank affirming a judgment and order dated passed by a learned Single Judge of the said court whereby and whereunder an award dated passed by <ORG> Chandigarh directing the workman to be reinstated in service with the benefit of past service without any back wages had not been interfered with He was transferred to Kolkata on or about but he did not join the said office or before when he was supposed to do so On his failure to report to Kolkata office by a notice was issued by the <ORG> on asking him to show cause as to why disciplinary proceedings should not be initiated against him Taking however a lenient view he was transferred to Amritsar on and then to <NAME> on a representation having been made in this behalf A leave for a period of days was sought for and sanctioned in favour of the workman on an application made therefor by him on or about A further leave of days was sanctioned by an order dated Yet again he filed an application seeking leave for one month on although he had only days accumulated leave to his credit and his leave account had already been deducted by days medical leave Whereas an employee has not submitted any application for leave and absents himself from work for a period of or more consecutive days without or beyond any leave to his credit or absents himself for or more consecutive days beyond the period of leave originally sanctioned or subsequently extended and where there is satisfactory evidence that he has taken up employment in India and the management is satisfied that he has no present intention of joining duties the management may at any time thereafter give a notice to the employee last known address calling upon the employee to report for duty within days of the notice stating inter alia the grounds for the management coming to the conclusion that the employee has no intention of joining duties and furnishing necessary evidence where available Unless the employee reports for duty within days or unless he gives an explanation for his absence satisfying the management that he has not taken up another employment or avocation and that he has no intention of not joining duties the employee will be deemed to have voluntarily retired from the bank service on the expiry of the said notice In the event of the employee submitting a satisfactory reply he shall be permitted to report for duty thereafter within days from the date of the expiry of the aforesaid notice without prejudice to the <ORG> right to take any action under the law or rules of service Despite the expiry of the period of leave in June the workman did not report back for duties whereupon the Branch Manager <NAME> informed him by a letter dated that he should rejoin his duties which was not complied with An explanation was sought for from him by Memorandum dated whereby and whereunder he was asked to show cause as to why he had been on unauthorized leave for such a long period Such an explanation was to be filed by He had further been asked to join duties the workman failed to join his duties by Consequently a show cause notice dated served on him whereby and whereunder he was intimated that in the event of his failure to resume his duties by he would be deemed to have been discharged from the services of the <ORG> He again applied for grant of leave on medical ground on This convinced the bank that Mr <NAME> was not at all interested in the services of the bank which prompted it to issue an order vide No Per Disp dated in accordance with the provisions contained in Memorandum of Settlements dated and Mr <NAME> was deemed to have voluntarily retired from the services of the bank A legal notice was served upon the <ORG> herein after a long time demanding the reinstatement of the workman on or about to which it was replied that he had been engaged in some business at <ORG> and thus it was clear that he had no interest in continuing in the services of the <ORG> Sometime in June a conciliation proceeding was initiated by him under the Industrial Disputes Act resulting in a reference made by <ORG> in terms of a Notification dated A writ petition was also filed by the workman questioning non grant of back wages The learned Single Judge although noticed the contentions raised in both the writ petitions but dealt with the one filed by the workman only Mr <NAME> the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the <ORG> would submit that <ORG> cum Labour Court as also both the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench of <ORG> proceeded on a wrong premise that it was obligatory on the part of the <ORG> to conduct a full fledged departmental proceeding According to the learned counsel <ORG> as also <ORG> erred in law insofar as they failed to take into consideration that the principles of natural justice had been complied with as repeated opportunities had been given to the workman to explain his position as also report for duties Mr <NAME> the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the workman on the other hand would contend that as a plea for extension of leave was raised by the workman if the same had not been proved to be satisfactory to the management it was obligatory on its part to conduct a departmental proceeding against him He merely raised a plea that the same was not applicable The plea of the <ORG> on the other hand was that the stipulations contained in the bipartite settlement were attracted if the employer arrives at a satisfaction that that there were sufficient grounds for it to arrive at a conclusion that the employee was no longer interested to continue in the service What fell for consideration before <ORG> was the interpretation and or applicability of the said settlement It lays down a complete machinery as to how and in what manner the employer can arrive at a satisfaction that the workman has no intention to join his duties It is not in dispute that after the period of leave came to an end in June the workman did not report back for duties It is in that situation the memorandum dated was issued and he was asked to joint his duties It is furthermore not in dispute that despite receipt of the said memorandum the workman did not join duties pursuant whereto he was served with a notice to show cause dated He was required to resume his duties by The <ORG> received a telegram on and only about a month thereafter he filed an application for grant of leave on medical ground Opportunities after opportunities indisputably had been granted to the workman to explain his position but he chose not to do so except filing applications for grant of medical leave and that too without annexing proper medical certificates It should be given a literal meaning A bare perusal of the said settlement would show that on receipt of a notice contemplated thereunder the workman must either report for duties within thirty days give his explanation for his absence satisfying the management that he has not taken any employment or avocation and show that he has no intention of not joining the duties In the instant case except for asking for grant of medical leave he did not submit any explanation for his absence satisfying the management that he has not taken up any other employment or avocation and that he has no intention of not joining his duties In the aforementioned fact situation we do not see any reason as to why the <ORG> could not arrive at a satisfaction that the workman had no intention to join his duties It is interesting to note that though the said order was passed on a representation to the <ORG> was made by the workman to reconsider the said decision after a period of years and months by a letter dated Yet again a dispute was sought to be raised by issuance of a legal notice on the <ORG> only on We cannot accept the submission of Mr <NAME> that only because on a later date an application for grant of medical leave was filed the same ipso facto would put an embargo on the exercise of the jurisdiction of the <ORG> from invoking clause of the bipartite settlement A limited enquiry as to whether the employee concerned had sufficient explanation for not reporting to duties after the period of leave had expired or failure on his part on being asked so to do in our considered view amounts to sufficient compliance of the requirements of the principles of natural justice It will bear repetition to state that the only defence which came to be raised by the workman was non applicability of the bipartite settlement The notice dated refers to the said settlement by necessary implication as on the failure of the workman to resume his duties by it was stated that he would be deemed to have been discharged from the services of the <ORG> Yet again in terms of the memorandum dated attention of the workman was drawn to the fact that his application for grant of leave was neither in the prescribed form nor any medical certificate was attached thereto It was pointed out that the medical certificate shows that he was under the doctor treatment from to and as such he should have reported for duties on and as he failed to do so it gave rise to an inference that he was not interested to continue in <ORG> services He did not submit any satisfactory explanation nor he filed any valid medical certificate It was in that situation the order dated was issued which again referred to the provisions contained in memorandum of settlement dated It cannot be put in a straitjacket formula It cannot be applied in a vacuum without reference to the relevant facts and circumstances of the case Two principles emerge from the decisions principles of natural justice and duty to act in a just fair and reasonable manner have to be read in the Certified Standing Orders which have statutory force These can be applied by <ORG> and <ORG> even to relations between the management and workman though based on contractual obligations and where domestic inquiry was not held or it was vitiated for some reason the <ORG> or <ORG> adjudicating an industrial dispute can itself go into the question raised before it on the basis of the evidence and other material on record In the present case action was taken by the <ORG> under clause of the Bipartite Settlement It was thereafter that the <ORG> served a notice on him calling upon him to report for duty within days of the notice stating therein the grounds for the <ORG> to come to the conclusion that <NAME> had no intention of joining duties On the expiry of the notice period the <ORG> passed orders that <NAME> had voluntarily retired from the service of the <ORG> It rightly held that <NAME> has voluntarily retired from the service of the <ORG> An inquiry would have been necessary if <NAME> had submitted his explanation which was not acceptable to the <ORG> or contended that he did report for duty but was not allowed to join by the <ORG> Assuming for a moment that inquiry was necessitated evidence led before the <ORG> clearly showed that notice was given to <NAME> and it is he who defaulted and offered no explanation of his absence from duty and did not report for duty within days of the notice as required in clause of the Bipartite Settlement The aforementioned legal position was reaffirmed by a decision of three Judge Bench in <ORG> supra wherein it has been held Under this rule the employee is given an opportunity to rejoin duty within a stipulated time or explain his position to the satisfaction of the management that he has no intention of not joining duty and a presumption will be drawn that the employee does not require the job anymore and will stand retired from service Thus there is no punishment for misconduct but only to notice the realities of the situation resulting from long absence of an employee from work with no satisfactory explanation thereto In <ORG> supra admittedly no opportunity was given to the workman and no inquiry was held The cardinal point that has to be borne in mind in every case is whether the person concerned should have a reasonable opportunity of presenting his case and the authority should act fairly justly reasonably and impartially Keeping in view the fact that we have ourselves considered the pleadings of the parties as also the materials on records it is not necessary to remit the matter to the <ORG> as it would not serve any purpose Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case and for the reasons stated hereinbefore we are of the opinion that the appeal preferred by the <ORG> should be allowed and that of the workman should be dismissed
