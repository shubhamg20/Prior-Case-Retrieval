of Table A title to get on the register and the full property in the shares in a company Distinction It further held that there was no equity in favour of the appellant so that he may claim the right to complete what was left incomplete by the donor in her life time On appeal it was contended in this Court that since the donor had signed the blank transfer forms and handed them over to the done the gift deed and the signed blank forms had to be read together and that the transfer was complete with the registration of the gift deed and even delivery of share certificates to the done was not necessary in view of of the Transfer of Property Act Allowing the appeal HELD The respondent has not made out a case for defeating the clearly expressed intentions of the donor coupled with the authority with which the donor was armed by reason of the signed blank transfer forms There was no question of competing equities because the donee appellant was shown to have obtained a complete legal right to obtain shares under the gift deed and an implied authority to take steps to get his name registered Section of the Act gives a wide connotation to transfer of property Section of the Companies Act says that they shall be movable property transferable in the manner provided by articles of the Company but would cover as a separate form of property a right to obtain shares which may be antecedent to the accrual of rights of a shareholder upon the grant of a share certificate in accordance with the articles of association of a company There is a distinction between the title to get on the register and the full property in the shares in a company Section of the Act justifies such a splitting up of rights constituting property in shares just as it is well recognised that rights of ownership of property may be split up into a right to the Corpus and another to the usufruct of the property and then separately dealt with Section of the Act prescribes the mode of transfer by gift No special mode of delivery is specified in the section There is nothing in Regulation to indicate that without strict compliance with some rigidly prescribed form the transaction must fail to achieve its purpose The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <ORG> This appeal after certification by <ORG> of fitness of the case for it I rises in the following circumstances <NAME> a flourishing lawyer made a will on and died childless on His widow <NAME> obtained under the will inter alia certain shares the right and title to which are disputed before us Therefore the respondent before us <NAME> a nephew of the late <NAME> disputed the claim of the appellant Vasudev Ramchandra <NAME> to these shares in an administration suit which came up before a learned Judge of <ORG> in second appeal together with other matters The learned Single Judge held that <NAME> was entitled to the shares covered by the registered gift deed to which the blank transfer forms could be related but not to others said to have been orally gifted with which we are not concerned here The learned Judge having granted leave to file a Letter Patent Appeal <ORG> of <ORG> which considered the rival claims reversed the decision of the learned Single Judge even with regard to the shares covered by the registered gift deed on the ground that the gift was incomplete for failure to comply with the formalities prescribed by the Companies Act for transfer of shares It held that there was no equity in favour of <NAME> so that he may claim a right to complete what was left incomplete by the donor in her lifetime even though there could be no doubt that <NAME> had intended to donate the shares to <NAME> After indicating the terms of the gift deed <ORG> held Thus it is undoubtedly true that the deed of gift discloses a clear and unequivocal intention on the part of <NAME> that <NAME> should become the owner of these shares and he should for all future time enjoy the fruits thereof it is a well settled position in law that unless the gift it completed as required by law mere intention to make a gift cannot pass any title to the donee and does not make the donee the owner of the property gifted by the donor It went on to say The circumstances as they clearly emerge and the facts as found by the Courts below go to show that the deed of gift was executed on March and at the same time the re levant share certificates were handed over by the donor to the donee and sometime between March when the gift deed was executed and April when <NAME> died blank transfer forms signed by <NAME> were handed over by <NAME> to <NAME> the donee The appellant submissions on facts found may be summarised as follows As between the donor and the donee the transfer was complete with the registration of the gift deed and as there was a registered document even delivery of share certificates to the donee was not necessary in view of Section Transfer of Property Act The conduct of the donor in handing over the share certificates to the donee and the blank transfer forms read in the context of the expressly laid down intentions of the donor in the gift deed raised the presumption of an implied authority to fill in the details and to submit to the companies concerned the forms given by the donor to <NAME> before her death There was no evidence whatsoever in the case to repel the irresistible inference of an implied authority given to the donee to fill in and submit the transfer forms so as to obtain the necessary entries in the registers of the various companies concerned <ORG> had after giving all the necessary findings of fact in favour of the appellant misdirected itself by resorting to the doctrine that there is no equity to complete an incomplete transaction as there is when a bonafide purchaser for value comes before the <ORG> There was no question of any equity involved here Did the inference of an implied authority of the donee to fill in the forms and take other steps necessary to get his name entered in the registers of shareholders arise or not Instead of considering and deciding whether such an inference arose <ORG> had failed to decide the real issue on the erroneous view that equity debars it from inferring an implied authority because the donee unlike a bona fide purchaser for value had paid nothing for the rights he could get from the donor All that could be urged on behalf of the respondent may be summed up as follows The facts found make out at best an intention of <NAME> to donate but not the completion of a donation required by law for divesting the donor of interest in the property under consideration which consisted of shares Sections of the Transfer of Property Act had to be read harmoniously with Sections and of the Companies Act Equity does not aid a merely purported donee who has given no consideration to obtain any right of our Contract Act the Principal death terminates the agency so that the doctrine of implied authority does not help the appellant Section of the Contract Act could not apply to a case where the subject matter of the alleged agency is the taking of steps to complete a transfer and not the rights which could only accrue after the necessary steps are taken Section of the Contract Act could apply to a case where an agent has an actual or existing interest in the subject matter of the agency Section of the Contract Act contemplated cases of termination of agency in ways other than death We think that questions to be really decided in the case before us have tended to become needlessly clouded by references to statutory provisions and to doctrines or concepts which really operate in separate and distinct fields of their own Nor does it prescribe the mode for every legally recognised transfer Section of this Act gives a wide connotation to transfer of pro perty Section of the Companies Act says that they shall be movable property transferable in the manner provided by the articles of the company of Property Act includes not merely shares as transferable movable property but would cover as a separable form of property a right to obtain shares which may be antecedent to the accrual of rights of a shareholder upon the grant of a share certificate in accordance with the articles of <ORG> which was a case of handing over share certificates together with blank signed transfer forms <ORG> said at But further there seems to their Lordships a good deal of confusion arising from the prominence given to the fact that the full property in shares in a company is only in the registered holder The company is entitled to deal with the shareholder who Is on the register and only a person who is on the register is in the full sense of the the word owner of the share But the title to get on the register consists in the possession of a certificate together with a transfer signed by the registered holder He had the certificates and blank transfers signed by the registered holders It would be an upset of all <ORG> transactions if it were suggested that a broker who sold shares by general description Indian Appeals did not implement his bargain by supplying the buyer with certificates and blank transfers signed by the registered holders of the shares described He could sell no more He sold what in England would have been chooses in action and he delivered chooses in action Hence equitable considerations not applicable to goods do not apply to shares in India Thus we find that in <NAME> case supra a distinction was made between the title to get on the register and the full property in the shares in a <ORG> We think that Section of the Transfer of Property Act Justifies such a splitting up of rights constituting property in shares just as it is well recognised that rights of ownership of a property may be split up into a right to the corpus and another to the usufruct of the property and then separately dealt with Section of the Transfer of Property Act prescribes the mode of transfer by gift It lays down that the transfer may be effected either by registered instrument signed by the donor and attested by at least two witnesses or by delivery In it the donor specified and gave particulars of the shares meant to be gifted and undertook to get the name of the donee put on to the registers of the companies concerned The donor even said that she was thenceforth a trustee for the benefit of the donee with regard to the income she may get due to the fact that her name was still entered in the registers of the companies concerned as a shareholder They subserve an object It is concerned with the acts and proceedings relating to the formation running and extinction of companies with rights duties and liabilities of those who are either members or officers of such companies and of those who deal with companies in other capacities It deals with transfers of shares only because they give certain rights to the legally recognised shareholders and imposes some obligations upon them with regard to the companies in which they hold shares In other words it presupposes that a transfer has already taken place Shares in the company shall be transferred in the following form or in any usual or common form which the directors shall approve A of in consideration of the sum of rupees paid to me by <NAME> hereinafter called the said transferee do hereby transfer to the said transferee the share or shares numbered in the undertaking called <ORG> to hold unto the said transferee his executors administrators and assigns subject to the several conditions on which I held the same at the time of the execution thereof and I the said transferee do hereby agree to take the said share or shares subject to the conditions aforesaid This regulation says The instrument of transfer of any share in the company shall be executed both by the transferor and transferee and the transferor shall be deemed to remain holder of the share until the name of the transferee is entered in the register of members in respect thereof There is nothing in regulation or anywhere else in our Company law to indicate that without strict compliance with some rigidly prescribed form the transaction must fail to achieve its purpose Considerable argument was advanced by both sides on the correct interpretation of the leading English case mentioned there Re Nose Midland Bank Executor Trustee Co Rose where <NAME> after an exhaustive discussion of the English case law on the subject held that when a testator had done everything that lay in his power to divest himself of his Fights in preference shares completion of the legal title by registration could only be the act of a third party which did not affect the efficacy of the gift of shares inter vivos In the case before us we find that <NAME> had actually stated in the gift deed that her position vis a vis the donee who had accepted the gift was that of a trustee for the benefits received by her from the gifted shares until the completion of the legal formalities so that appropriate entries are made in the registers of companies concerned and fresh share certificates are issued to the donee The company recognises no person except one whose name is on the register of members upon whom alone calls for unpaid capital can be made and to whom only the dividend declared by the company is legally payable of course between the transferor and the transferee certain equities arise even on the execution and handing over of a blank transfer and among these equities is the right of the transferee to claim the dividend declared and paid to the transferor who is treated as a trustee on behalf of the transferee These equities however do not touch the company and no claim by the transferee whose name is not in the register of Ch Another case cited before us was Subba Naidu Commis sioner of Gift Tax Madras where a distinction was made between a transfer of the antecedent right to the shares which operated with full force between a donor and the donee notwithstanding that vis a vis the company the donor continued to be holder of the shares in the absence of transfer of shares The Companies Act did not prevent the completion of a gift of the right to obtain the shares which could in common parlance or loosely speaking be spoken of as a gift of shares themselves even before the gift is acted upon so that the donee obtains share certificates in his own name other cases cited on behalf of the appellant which we will only mention without discussion were Pending registration the transferee has only an equitable right to the shares transferred to him He does not become the legal owner until his name is entered on the register in respect of these shares Thus we find in Palmer Company Law at There is nothing to limit the restrictions which a company articles may place on the right of transfer The articles may give the directiors power to refuse to register a transfer in any specified cases for instance where calls are in arrear or where the company has a lien on the shares and some such provisions are usually inserted In the type of cases contemplated above where there are special restrictions on the transfer of shares imposed by the articles of association the difficulty or defect is inherent in the character of such shares Therefore in such cases it is possible to hold that even the right and title to obtain shares which we have viewed as separable from the legal right and title to function as a shareholder is incomplete because of a defect in the nature of shares held due to some special restrictions on their transferability under the articles of association of the company concerned But such is not shown to be the case at all with any of the shares which formed the subject matter of the gift in favour of <NAME> Hence in our opinion cases which deal with inchoate rights to shares do not assist the respondent because at least a gift of the right to obtain the transfer of shares in the books of the companies concerned was shown to be complete on the terms of the gift deed of <NAME> coupled with the handing over of the share certificates and the subsequent signing of the blank transfer forms The donor had done everything which she could reasonably be expected to do to divest herself of her rights in the shares donated Case <NAME> <NAME> Ch and <NAME> North Western Bank Ch that where the articles are in the form in which they are in the present case a legal title is not acquired as against an equitable owner before registration or at all events until the date when the person seeking to register has a present absolute and unconditional right to have the transfer registered I am not called upon to define the meaning of a present absolute and unconditional right but as it appears to me I am not sure that anything short of registration would do except under very special circumstances At all events I am of opinion that in this case prior to the date of the injunction the defendant <ORG> had not a present absolute and unconditional right to the registration of the transfer of these shares and that the prior equitable right of the plaintiff Mrs <NAME> must prevail I was referred on that to the well known case of <NAME> <NAME> and also the recent case of Re Those cases as I understand them turn on the fact that the deceased donor had not done all in his power according to the nature of the property given to vest the legal interest in the property in the donee In such circumstances it is of course well settled that there is no equity to complete the imperfect gift In this case as I understand it the testator had done everything in his power to divest himself of the shares in question to Mr <NAME> There was nothing else the testator could do Therefore it seems to me that the present case is not in pari materia with the two cases to which I have been referred In that case apart from other distinguishing features the flaw in the purported transfer was that it contravened the Defence Finance Regulation Act which prohibited an acquisition of interest in the shares without a licence from the <ORG> It seems to conflict with the law declared in the cases cited by the appellant which we approve <NAME> because the articles of association vested an absolute discretion in the company to recognise or refuse to recognise a transfer In other words this was a case in which the provisions of articles of association stood in the way of rectification of the register The result is that We do not think that the respondent has made out a case for defeating the clearly expressed intentions of the donor coupled with the authority with which the donee was armed by reason of the signed blank transfer forms We think that the implied authority was given with regard to a subject matter in which <NAME> had acquired an interest There was no question here of competing equities because the donee appellant was shown to have obtained a complete legal right to obtain shares under the gift deed and an implied authority to take steps to get his name registered This right could only be defeated by showing some obstacle which prevented it from arising or which could defeat its exercise No such obstacle having been shown to us to exist the rights of the donee appellant would prevail as against any legal rights which could have accrued to others if the donee had not already acquired the legal right which as held by us above had become vested in him We therefore allow this appeal with costs and set aside the judgment and decree of <ORG> of <ORG> and restore that of the learned Single Judge
