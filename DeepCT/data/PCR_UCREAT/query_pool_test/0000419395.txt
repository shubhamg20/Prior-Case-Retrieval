A preliminary decree has been made by the learned Subordinate Judge and the appeal is directed against that preliminary decree The property which is the subject matter of this appeal originally belonged to two brothers <NAME> and <NAME> Defendant brought a suit on his mortgage on th November and a preliminary decree was made on nd January There is no dispute with regard to item with which the present appellants have no concern and the whole dispute centres round item which had been mortgaged to defendant But it is stated that there were other purchasers who were trustees with regard to some charitable trust but that is a matter with which we are not concerned and this was not discussed in the <ORG> below The Receiver was discharged by order of the <ORG> and defendant took possession of the disputed property as purchaser The question which is in debate in this <ORG> and which was the subject matter of dispute in the <ORG> below is whether the mother is entitled to a fourth share of the property including property No according to the provisions of the Hindu Law on a partition being made among the sons There is one small matter which has not been much debated that a half share of the property is not the ancestral property of the brothers and therefore if the widow of <NAME> is entitled to a share on a partition between her sons she would get a fourth share of item He has however made a decree to this effect that defendant the mother would get a fourth share of both the properties Nos and and the plaintiff and defendants to would each get a fourth share of the property No But it is contended on behalf of the appellants that under the circumstances of this case the lady would be entitled to get no share in property No In that case <NAME> laid down the principle on which according to the Hindu Law the mother is entitled to get a share on a partition made among the sons born of her womb of the property inherited from the father The learned Judge after quoting the text from <NAME> observes With reference to the above passage front the Dayabhaga it has been held and it must now be taken as settled law that the mother right to claim a share arises only when her sons come to a partition in other words that she cannot enforce her claim to a share so long her sons remain joint and do not ask for partition But there is nothing said in this passage or in any other authoritative text of <ORG> as to a mother right to a share on partition being so absolutely non existent before partition that it may be defeated by any of her sons alienating his share before coming to a partition He then proceeds in this way In my opinion the correct view to take of this right would be to hold that it is an inchoate right as long as no partition is come to amongst the sons and it becomes actually enforceable only when the sons come to a partition or in other words that the right when it becomes enforceable by reason of a partition being come to among the sons is Cal enforceable not only as against the song and as regards so much only of the joint property as at the date of partition is in the hands of the sons but also as against any person deriving title from any of the sons and as regards the property to which they may have so derived title subject to certain qualifications and limitations It was held by the <ORG> that by reason of the sale the interest obtained by the purchaser is subject to the rule of lis pendens and that he cannot stand on a higher footing than that of his vendor and when the partition is made if his vendor was a party to the suit the mother would get a share that right cannot be defeated during the pendency of the suit by one of the sons transferring his interest in favour of a third party But if the mother could get any right in the present suit by reason of the partition that would not be by the right created by the mortgagor but it would arise under the Hindu Law and I doubt whether the principle enunciated by the appellant would apply to such a case In this case in my opinion the plaintiff had a right to bring the suit for partition at the time when he brought the suit Although there had been a preliminary decree for partition the title of the plaintiff to his share of the property was not extinguished by that preliminary decree on mortgage but he had still a subsisting interest in the share of the property by reason of succession to his father Now it is contended on behalf of the respondent that defendant is bound by the rule of lis pendens as was applied in the case of <NAME> Fulkumari Dassi Cal The difficulty in this case is that that principle cannot be applied to this case Here defendant has acquired the interest of the plaintiff as well as the defendants who had interest in the property That being so the mother would not be entitled to any share of property No by reason of the fact that her sons had no interest in the property and this property could not be the subject of partition That question cannot arise in a suit for partition and if she has any right the question must be left open to be debated in a subsequent suit The result therefore is that the judgment and preliminary decree of the Subordinate Judge should be modified to this extent that the suit for partition with regard to property No i the Strand road premises should stand dismissed and therefore any claim of defendant will also stand dismissed and the appeal is allowed to this extent
