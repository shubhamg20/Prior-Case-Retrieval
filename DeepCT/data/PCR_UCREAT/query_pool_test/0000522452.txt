HEADNOTE Section of the East Punjab General Sales Tax Act provided that no tax shall be payable on the sale of goods specified in the Schedule to the Act and that no dealer shall charge sales tax on the sale of goods which were declared tax free from time to time Sub section of empowered <ORG> by notification to add or to delete from the Schedule The tax was a yearly tax levied on the taxable turnover of a dealer every year though it was collected in some cases at the end of the year in some cases quarterly and in other cases monthly If the exemption operated for the period for which the tax was payable according as it was annually quarterly or monthly the tax would be different for different persons those paying annually would get exemption for the whole year but those paying quarterly or monthly would get the benefit in the quarter or month of the notification and not for earlier quarters or months The Judgment of <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> was delivered by <NAME> <NAME> delivered a separate judgment HIDAYATULLAH The appellants are a firm of general merchants which sells among other goods manufactured tobacco as defined in the Punjab Tobacco Vend Fees Act of which came into force in the State of Punjab from April Ch by which <ORG> had given notice as required by law of its intention to add the said item in the schedule of exemptions The Press Note reads as follows There is some misapprehension in the minds of dealers in manufactured tobacco as to whether sales tax is also chargeable in respect of manufactured tobacco after the st April in addition to the license fees under the Tobacco Vend Fees Act Manufactured tobacco will be exempted from sales tax simultaneously with the enforcement of the Vend Fees The appellants had made enquiries from <ORG> Punjab about the Press Note of August and had been assured that the Notification as printed in the Newspapers was accurate and that Government intended implementing the Press Note On January the appellants received a notice from <ORG> Rohtak calling upon them to produce their account books The appellants as well as other dealers of manufactured tobacco similarly affected made representations on the basis of the Press Note of August but without success The appellants then filed on February a petition under Art was heard by a learned Single Judge of <ORG> who held that the orders of Government were entirely in accordance with law that the East Punjab Sales Tax Act in so far as it related to the sale of manufactured tobacco was not repealed by the Tobacco Vend Fees Act and that sales tax on manufactured tobacco was payable from April to September in view of the fact that the exemption was made on September and would operate from the latter date Against the decision of the learned Judge dismissing the writ petition an appeal under Letters Patent was filed <ORG> which heard the appeal agreed with the judgment appealed from and dismissed the appeal A certificate was however granted to the appellants and the present appeal has been filed Two contentions were raised in the forefront before <ORG> by the appellants No repeal can be implied unless there is an express repeal of an earlier Act by the later Act or unless the two Acts cannot stand together The question which is now raised and of which there is but a trace in <ORG> is the real one to decide and it may be formulated thus Did the exemption in the Notification issued on September have effect from that date or from the beginning of the financial year We are not concerned with the question whether in the absence of rules and forms the Punjab Tobacco Vend Fees Act could operate from April Taking the Notification by itself it cannot be said that it comes into force from an earlier date where a notification increasing sales tax on edible oils issued in the middle of the year was held not to apply to the assessee in that year inasmuch as its liability to tax had become fixed on April earlier as it had elected to pay tax on the turnover of the previous year We shall refer to them shortly as the Act and the Rules in the rest of this judgment The liability for sales tax in this appeal is for two quarters ending June and September There is no dispute that after September sales tax could not be levied in view of the inclusion of item in the schedule exempting manufactured tobacco from the operation of the Act We must now examine those provisions of the Act which are claimed by the rival parties to indicate the moment of time from which the exemption granted by the Notification began to operate Turnover has been defined in the Act to include the aggregate of the amounts of sales and parts of sales actually made by any dealer during the given period less certain allowances and year means the financial year Section provides for exemptions on the sale of goods which are specified in schedule to the Act Under <ORG> has been given the power to add to or delete from that schedule Section deals with the making of returns and payment of the tax Section empowers <ORG> to make rules for carrying out the purposes of the Act Section consists of five sub sections Sub Section which is a subject to the provisions of ss and says that every dealer except one dealing exclusively in goods declared tax free under whose gross turnover during the year immediately preceding the commencement of the Act exceeded the taxable quantum shall be liable to pay tax under the Act on all sales effected after the coming into force of this Act Sub section says that every dealer who is liable to pay tax under the first sub section shall be liable to pay it on the expiry of days after the date on which his gross turnover first exceeds the taxable quantum Sub sections and deal with the continuance of the liability of the dealer under certain circumstances and are not relevant here Section which deals with the rate of tax is made subject to the other provisions of the Act and the first sub section says that there shall be levied on the taxable turnover every year of a dealer a tax at such rates not exceeding two pice in a rupee as <ORG> may by notification direct Taxable turnover is then defined by the second sub section to mean that part of a dealer gross turnover during any period which remains after deducting therefrom inter alia his turnover during that period of tax free sales sales to registered dealers sales to any undertaking supplying electrical energy sales to dealers outside Punjab and other sales as may be prescribed No tax shall be payable under this Act on the sale of goods specified in the first column of the Schedule subject to the conditions and exceptions if any set out in the corresponding entry in the second column there of and no dealer shall charge Sales Tax on the sale of goods which are declared tax free from time to time under this section Rule reads Every registered dealer other than those referred to in rules and shall furnish returns in Form VIII or XXIII if so permitted quarterly within thirty days from the expiry of each quarter Rule Notwithstanding the provisions of rules and the appropriate <ORG> may for reasons to be recorded in writing fix monthly returns for a dealer who would otherwise be required to furnish quarterly or annually under these rules Section and Rules and clearly provide that returns may be made annually quarterly or monthly It is thus possible that some dealers pay tax annually some quarterly and some monthly There is no doubt that the tax is a yearly tax It was payable in the first instance by a dealer whose gross turnover during the financial year immediately preceding May was above the taxable quantum Those who are paying the tax annually would get exemption for the whole year but those who are paying it quarterly or monthly would get benefit in the quarter or the month of the Notification but not for earlier quarters or months In the tax is made leviable on the taxable turnover every year of a dealer In the present case the Notification did not fix the date from which the exemption was to operate probably because the Act omitted to make such provision enabling the <ORG> to do so and the exemption must therefore operate for the whole year during which it was granted The case of this Court to which we have referred earlier dealt with an Act under which the taxpayer could elect to pay the tax on the turnover of either the previous year or the year of assessment The majority view on that occasion pointed out that it was not possible to divide the assessment year in two portions in which the tax was levied at one rate in one part and another rate in another part The case was confined to a dealer who had elected to pay the tax for a year different from that in which the exemption was granted KAPUR The facts of this case have been set out in the judgment of my learned brother <NAME> which I have had the advantage of reading and as I am unable to agree with the conclusion that the effect of the exemption given by Notification No CH dated September issued under of the Punjab General Sales Tax Act Act of hereinafter called the Act on unmanufactured tobacco becomes effective as from the beginning of the financial year I proceed to give my reasons for the same Previous to the issuing of the notification of September <ORG> issued a notification required under of the Act for the purpose of information of persons likely to be affected thereby and to give them an opportunity to file any objections or suggestions in regard to the same In order to resolve the controversy as to whether the exemption is effective from the commencement of the financial year or from the date of the notification it is necessary to refer to the scheme of the Act and the rules made thereunder Section of the Act gives definitions and cl defines a dealer as a person engaged in the business of selling or supplying goods In cl i Turnover was defined to include the aggregate of the amount of a sale and parts of the sale actually made by any dealer during the given period less any sum allowed as cash discount according to ordinary trade practice Sections and are the charging sections the former makes the tax leviable prospectively and the latter prescribes the rate of tax The relevant portions of these sections when quoted are as follows Subject to the provisions of sections and every dealer except one dealing exclusively in goods declared tax free under section whose gross turnover during the year immediately preceding the commencement of this Act exceeded the taxable quantum shall be liable to pay tax under this Act on all sales effected after the coming into force of this Act Every dealer to whom sub section does not apply or who does not deal exclusively in goods declared to be tax free under section shall be liable to pay tax under this Act on the expiry of days after the date which his gross turnover first exceeds the taxable quantum Thus a dealer is liable to sales tax if his sales in the year preceding the commencement of the Act are more than the taxable quantum Subject to the provisions of this Act there shall be levied on the taxable turnover every year of a dealer a tax at such rates not exceeding two pice in a rupee as the State Government may by notification direct Provided that Government may by notification in the Official Gazette declare that in respect of any goods or class of goods the dealer may pay such lump sum by way of composition of the tax payable under this Act as the Government may notify from time to time a his turnover during that period on i the sale of goods declared tax free under section ii iii Section which makes provision for giving exemption is as follows No tax shall be payable under this act on the sale of goods specified in the first column of the Schedule subject to the conditions and exceptions if any set out in the corresponding entry in the second column thereof and no dealer shall charge Sales Tax on the sale of goods which are declared tax free from time to time under this section Section deals with payment of taxes of returns Section is the section dealing with assessments It provides that if <ORG> is satisfied that the returns furnished are correct and complete he shall assess the amount of tax due and if he is not so satisfied he can require the production of evidence which may be necessary and provision is also made for default in carrying out the notice issued Section gives the <ORG> the power to make rules The relevant portions of this section are clauses and i which were as follows the return to be furnished under sub section of section and dates by which and the authority to which such returns shall be furnished i the date by which returns for any period are to be furnished and the procedure to be followed for assessment under section Under the rule making power rules have been framed by <ORG> and reference may be made to Rules and Under the former rule every registered dealer is required to furnish returns in Form ST VIII or ST XXIII if so permitted quarterly within thirty days from the expiry of each quarter Under the latter <ORG> is given the power to tax the returns to be made monthly in the case of a dealer who would otherwise be required to furnish them quarterly or annually It was argued that the tax under was a yearly tax and therefore whenever the exemption may be given during a financial year the effect of the exemption will become operative as from the beginning of the financial year and emphasis was laid on the words there shall be levied on the taxable turnover every year of a dealer a tax The argument was that it was a yearly tax on the turnover and not that every year a tax was to be levied on the taxable turnover i aggregate of the sales made during a given period It was also argued that if the exemption of the turnover was to operate for the quarter in which the exemption was notified the consequence will be absurd as those who pay the tax on quarterly returns or monthly returns will not be able to get the advantage of the exemption whereas those who pay on yearly returns will be so entitled Section which provides for exemption specifically envisages the declaration from time to time of exemption of goods which are to be tax free It appears that it is for that reason that in the definition of the word turnover the legislature has chosen the word during the given period i the period for which the tax is leviable and is levied Similarly in subsection of where sales tax is levied on the taxable turnover of a dealer the use of the word during any period is again repeated and in cl a of that section reference is made to deduction from his turnover during that period of the sale of goods declared tax free under and that is for a good reason because itself mentions the declaration of tax free goods from time to time indicating that whenever during the year or at any time during the year when goods are notified to be tax free That the intention of the legislature was to give exemption from the date of the notification or such date as is mentioned in the notification is further supported by the provisions of ss and of the Act Under a dealer may be required to furnish his return at such intervals as may be prescribed and when he makes a return it must necessarily be of the goods on which during that period sales tax was exigible From the provisions of a it does not appear that returns are to be scrutinised at the end of the year like in income tax cases and assessment made on the income of the year preceding the assessment year The tax is also paid for that period i on the taxable turnover for the period for which the return is made and which becomes the subject matter of assessment When the assessment has been made and the tax assessed is paid the assessment for that period is completed and all proceedings and liabilities and subjected to what is stated as to escaped periods This is further clear from the rules which have been made in regard to registration and furnishing of returns If the contention of the appellants is correct then after all the returns have been filed the amount of sales tax according to the returns assessed and payments made there will have to be proceedings for reassessment remission or refund as the case may be in regard to those periods if any goods are added to the schedule exempting them from sales tax after the assessment or any goods are deleted from the schedule thus making them liable for sales tax and that will be for the periods of which the assessment had already been completed and finished It does not envisage reassessment for the purpose of refunding the tax assessed and paid on articles which were assessable at the time the assessment was made but became exempt later nor is it envisaged in the case of articles excluded from the schedule Section which deals with reassessments at the relevant time provided If upon information which has come into his possession <ORG> is satisfied that any dealer has been liable to pay tax under this Act in respect of any period has failed to apply for registration <ORG> shall assess to the best of his judgment the amount of tax due from the dealer I would therefore dismiss this appeal with costs
