No of has been filed by the borrower against whom action has been taken as per the provisions of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act for brevity the SARFAESI Act for recovery by giving demand notice under Section of the SARFAESI Act possession notice under Section of the SARFAESI Act and obtaining an order of assistance from the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate under Section of the SARFAESI Act appointing an Advocate Commissioner to take possession with the help of the police challenging the said Section of the SARFAESI Act as ultra vires the same borrower has filed No of challenging an order dated in Crl No of passed by the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate <NAME> under Section of the SARFAESI Act as stated above as one passed without application of mind and in violation of the principles of natural justice and hence arbitrary and illegal After gleaning the entire materials made available with the court and upon hearing the petitioner the court is fully satisfied with a need to render necessary assistance to the secured creditor in taking over the secured assets All the legal formalities have already been complied with scrupulously and accordingly this court is inclined to confer the relief sought for by the petitioner under section of the SARFAESI Act Nos of and of have been filed by the petitioners who are stated to be tenants of various residential portions in respect of which the respective landlords have borrowed amounts from the bank or stood as guarantor to the third party borrowers and the bank while enforcing their rights under the SARFAESI Act after giving demand notice under Section of the SARFAESI Act to the borrowers or guarantors who have been made as second respondent in these writ petitions followed by possession notice under Section of the SARFAESI Act have obtained an order of assistance from the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate concerned under Section of the SARFAESI Act appointing an Advocate Commissioner to take possession Likewise in No of the second respondent landlord has availed Cash Credit facility to an extent of Crores and Term Loan facility to an extent of on from the first respondent bank in respect of which the residential houses in Door Nos and in No of Karumandi Chellipalayam Village Perundurai <NAME> District were given as security for repayment and since the second respondent landlord failed to pay back the amount the first respondent bank after giving demand notice under Section of the SARFAESI Act on followed by possession notice under Section of the SARFAESI Act on has obtained the impugned order of assistance dated from the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate <NAME> under Section of the SARFAESI Act appointing an Advocate Commissioner to take possession In these proceedings also the petitioners who claim to be tenants have not been given notice and are under the threat of eviction As stated above in this case also the petitioners who are claiming themselves to be tenants have not been given any notice at any point of time and are facing the threat of eviction Barring No of wherein the petitioner has challenged the vires of Section of the SARFAESI Act as null and void in all other writ petitions the petitioners have challenged the validity and correctness of the orders passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrates under Section of the SARFAESI Act The petitioner in No of as stated above has chosen to challenge Section of the SARFAESI Act having known that the validity of the SARFAESI Act has been upheld by <ORG> contending inter alia that Section of the SARFAESI Act confers an unfettered power without proper guidance to the Chief Judicial Magistrate that while passing an order of assistance by the Chief Judicial Magistrate under Section of the SARFAESI Act there is no necessity for him to hear the affected party who is in actual possession of the property sought to be taken physical possession and therefore it is an infraction of the principles of natural justice that the occupier who is not given any notice before any order of assistance is passed by the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate under Section of the SARFAESI Act is suddenly disturbed from his possession and especially when it is dwelling house it causes grave injustice to the occupant that the said Section being penal in nature ought to have provided opportunity of hearing to the occupant before passing the order of assistance especially when such power has been vested with the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate and District Magistrate that even otherwise Section of the SARFAESI Act has to be read down in the interest of justice that the said section is arbitrary and in violation of the fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles and of the Constitution of India and therefore is liable to be struck down It is his contention that the validity or otherwise of Section of the SARFAESI Act was not an issue before <ORG> and the judgment of <ORG> is binding only on the points raised and argued and applying the doctrine of sub silentio it cannot be said that even the points which were not argued or discussed before <ORG> have to be followed It is his submission that even in <ORG> case supra where <ORG> has upheld the validity of the SARFAESI Act <ORG> has left it open to decide in future any problem about the working of any particular provision of the SARFAESI Act and therefore while deciding the validity of the SARFAESI Act as a whole <ORG> has not considered the vires of Section of the SARFAESI Act It is his submission that it is not as if by striking down Section of the SARFAESI Act as ultra vires the entire SARFAESI Act will be negated and therefore even if the vires of the particular provision is challenged the same would not affect the validity of the SARFAESI Act as upheld by <ORG> in <ORG> case supra and thus he sought to read down the said provision He has also contended that due to various conflicting views expressed by various High Courts in respect of Section of the SARFAESI Act and in order to save the bona fide occupants from arbitrary eviction by obtaining the order of assistance by the secured creditor by approaching the Chief Judicial Magistrate under Section of the SARFAESI Act the validity of the said provision needs a re look He has also submitted that Section of the SARFAESI Act apart from making the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or District Magistrate as an agent of the secured creditor for the purpose of taking possession by using force has in effect taken away the rights of the affected party granted even under the Code of Criminal Procedure It is his further submission that while under Section of the SARFAESI Act the Chief Judicial Magistrate is entitled to direct the police to use necessary force for the purpose of taking possession there are absolutely no guidelines for the purpose of using force and such unrestrained right may tend to arbitrary exercise of the power by the Chief Judicial Magistrate at the instance of the secured creditor for whose benefit or assistance Section of the SARFAESI Act has been provided He submits that in cases where the occupant is a tenant or a person other than a borrower such person has a statutory right under the Tamil Nadu Buildings Lease and Rent Control Act or even under the Transfer of Property Act not to be evicted except under certain circumstances and indeed such eviction should only be after following the procedure contemplated under the said Acts and therefore there is every possibility for an unscrupulous landlord who is unable to evict a tenant to take the aid of Section of the SARFAESI Act for the purpose of taking physical possession by using force with the assistance of the Chief Judicial Magistrate He adds that inasmuch as the tenant is having a statutory protection under the local laws and his lawful occupation can be evicted by the landlord only under certain circumstances the tenant who is not a borrower and who has never entered into any contractual obligation with the bank or financial institution cannot be thrown away even without his knowledge which will be affecting the fundamental rights It is also his submission that what is contemplated under the SARFAESI Act is symbolic possession and Section of the SARFAESI Act virtually enables the bank or financial institution to execute an order which is not permissible in any civil law He submitted that even for recovery and execution of a civil decree <ORG> cannot direct an occupant to vacate and even for the purpose of enabling a purchaser under the Specific Relief Act to enforce his right under the agreement the person who succeeds in the specific performance suit alone has to take action under the Tamil Nadu Buildings Lease and Rent Control Act to evict the tenant and while so under the impugned provision namely Section of the SARFAESI Act by using the administrative fiat of the order of the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate a bona fide occupier is thrown out mercilessly He would also submit that when the march of law is so much in respect of the principles of natural justice that even in cases where a statute is silent about affording an opportunity to the other side such opportunity which is treated to be noble is deemed to be inherent in any law it is not known as to how under Section of the SARFAESI Act a Chief Judicial Magistrate can pass an administrative order to assist the bank or financial institution directing the police to remove the occupant by using force without even knowing as to whether the person in occupation is a borrower or any other person like tenant for even a trespasser cannot be evicted without giving him an opportunity The learned counsel has also elaborately taken us through various other judgments including some of the judgments of <ORG> to insist that there is no impediment on the part of this <ORG> in holding Section of the SARFAESI Act as unconstitutional Per contra it is the contention of Mr <NAME> of <ORG> learned counsel appearing for the second respondent bank that the power of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or District Magistrate conferred under Section of the SARFAESI Act is purely executive and administrative in nature and it does not relate to the rights of any parties It is submitted that when the SARFAESI Act has been upheld by <ORG> in <ORG> case supra there is no scope for this Court to go into the correctitude of one of the sections It is not as if <ORG> was oblivious of the provisions of Section of the SARFAESI Act and in fact there has been a reference and <ORG> has consciously made an observation that there are certain sections which are monstrous but nevertheless taking into consideration the object of the SARFAESI Act such difficulties are to be condoned It is his submission that Section of the SARFAESI Act cannot be read independently and it is in continuation of the notices and various steps taken by the bank namely i classifying the debt as a non performing asset due to the consistent failure on the part of the borrower in payment after following certain procedure in accordance with the Reserve Bank of India Guidelines ii giving demand notice under Section of the SARFAESI Act giving sixty days time so as to enable the borrower to make payment and also give representation and iii finally taking possession by way of a notice under Section of the SARFAESI Act and it is only in cases where the bank itself is unable to take possession it approaches the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or District Magistrate under Section of the SARFAESI Act for assistance to take possession and therefore Section of the SARFAESI Act hinges upon Section of the SARFAESI Act and it cannot be read in isolation and moreover Section of the SARFAESI Act also forms part of Chapter III of the SARFAESI Act He contends that under the SARFAESI Act there is no dichotomy between symbolic possession and physical possession While it is true that notice under Section of the SARFAESI Act need not be given to an occupier other than the borrower because it is only a demand based on a contractual obligation between the bank and the borrower when once the bank resorts to possession notice under Section of the SARFAESI Act which is mandatory before moving the Chief Judicial Magistrate under Section of the SARFAESI Act the Security Interest Enforcement Rules especially Rule of the Rules contemplates affixture of such possession notice on the doors of the property and therefore the occupier or tenant or owner cannot plead that unbeknownst to him suddenly an order is obtained under Section of the SARFAESI Act It is his submission that by dint of Section of the SARFAESI Act which gives overriding effect based on the basic object of the SARFAESI Act a tenant cannot claim any superior right than that of the borrower Mr <NAME> learned Senior Counsel even though appears for the st respondent bank in Nos of and and of which are relating to the validity of the orders passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrates under Section of the SARFAESI Act has also made submissions in support of the validity of Section of the SARFAESI Act apart from supporting the individual orders passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrates concerned under Section of the SARFAESI Act Mr <NAME> learned <ORG> Standing Counsel appearing for <ORG> adopted the arguments advanced by <NAME> learned counsel for the second respondent bank We have heard the respective counsel and given our anxious thought to the issue involved in the above said writ petition challenging the vires of Section of the SARFAESI Act Before adverting to the rival contentions since the petitioner has chosen to challenge the validity of Section of the SARFAESI Act it is necessary to extract the said provision of the SARFAESI Act which is as follows Section Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or District Magistrate to assist secured creditor in taking possession of secured asset Where the possession of any secured asset is required to be taken by the secured creditor or if any of the secured asset is required to be sold or transferred by the secured creditor under the provisions of this Act the secured creditor may for the purpose of taking possession or control of any such secured asset request in writing the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or the District Magistrate within whose jurisdiction any such secured asset or other documents relating thereto may be situated or found to take possession thereof and the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or as the case may be the District Magistrate shall on such request being made to him a take possession of such asset and documents relating thereto and forward such asset and documents to the secured creditor For the purpose of securing compliance with the provisions of sub section the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or the District Magistrate may take or cause to be taken such steps and use or cause to be used such force as may in his opinion be necessary No act of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or the District Magistrate done in pursuance of this section shall be called in question in any court or before any authority The SARFAESI Act as it stood originally in the year enacted by replacing the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Ordinance provides for legal provisions for facilitating securitisation of financial assets of the banks and financial institutions While Section of the SARFAESI Act which is as follows Section The provisions of this Act to override other laws The provisions of this Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or any instrument having effect by virtue of any such law gives overriding effect to the SARFAESI Act notwithstanding anything inconsistent contained in any other law under Section of the SARFAESI Act which is as follows Section We therefore subject to what is provided in para above uphold the validity of the Act and its provisions except that of sub section of Section of the Act which is declared ultra vires Article of the Constitution of India It is no doubt true that in the said case the main questions that arose for consideration before <ORG> as framed by <ORG> are as follows i Whether it is open to challenge the statute on the ground that it was not necessary to enact it in the prevailing background particularly when another statute was already in operation ii Whether provisions as contained under Sections and of the Act provide adequate and efficacious mechanism to consider and decide the objections disputes raised by a borrower against the recovery particularly in view of bar to approach the civil court under Section of the Act iii Whether the remedy available under Section of the Act is illusory for the reason it is available only after the action is taken under Section of the Act and the appeal would be entertainable only on deposit of of the claim raised in the notice of demand iv Whether the terms or existing rights under the contract entered into by two private parties could be amended by the provisions of law providing certain powers in a one sided manner in favour of one of the parties to the contract Whether provision for sale of the properties without intervention of the court under Section of the Act is akin to the English mortgage and its effect on the scope of the bar of the jurisdiction of the civil court vi Whether the provisions under Sections and of the Act are unconstitutional on the basis of the parameters laid down in different decisions of this Court vii Whether the principle of lender liability has been absolutely ignored while enacting the Act and its effect Therefore it is true that the validity or otherwise of Section of the SARFAESI Act was not specifically the subject matter of consideration even though the entire SARFAESI Act was challenged It was also held that as against the measure of taking possession by issuing notice under Section of the SARFAESI Act the affected person has a right of appeal under Section of the SARFAESI Act to <ORG> Ergo it is clear that while the bank or financial institution resorts to take possession and enforce the security by sale it has to first classify the account of the borrower as a non performing asset depending upon various internal mechanism including the resolution of dispute as contemplated under Section of the SARFAESI Act either by conciliation or arbitration as provided under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act apart from the directions of <ORG> which is empowered under Section of the SARFAESI Act to determine policy and issue directions The word securitisation as defined under Section of the SARFAESI Act is as follows Section securitisation means acquisition of financial assets by any securitisation company or reconstruction company from any originator whether by raising of funds by such securitisation company or reconstruction company from qualified institutional buyers by issue of security receipts representing undivided interest in such financial assets or otherwise and the word originator used in the definition of securitisation means the owner of a financial asset which is acquired by a securitisation company and Section of the SARFAESI Act which defines the word originator is as follows Section originator means the owner of a financial asset which is acquired by a securitisation company or reconstruction company for the purpose of securitisation or asset reconstruction Section of the SARFAESI Act clearly shows that the power conferred under the said provision is notwithstanding the powers under Section or A of the Transfer of Property Act Therefore when the bank or financial institution resorts to proceed to enforce the security interest against the borrower the first step taken by the bank after classifying the due as a non performing asset is requiring the borrower by a notice in writing to discharge in full his liabilities by giving sixty days time from the date of issuance of notice stating that in case of default the bank is entitled to take recourse to Section of the SARFAESI Act Where any borrower who is under a liability to a secured creditor under a security agreement makes any default in repayment of secured debt or any instalment thereof and his account in respect of such debt is classified by the secured creditor as non performing asset then the secured creditor may require the borrower by notice in writing to discharge in full his liabilities to the secured creditor within sixty days from the date of notice failing which the secured creditor shall be entitled to exercise all or any of the rights under sub section the obligation of the bank or financial institution to give such notice is to the borrower By virtue of an amendment which was inserted to the SARFAESI Act under Act of with effect from a new sub section was introduced as sub section A to Section of the Act which is as follows Section A If on receipt of the notice under sub section the borrower makes any representation or raises any objection the secured creditor shall consider such representation or objection and if the secured creditor comes to the conclusion that such representation or objection is not acceptable or tenable he shall communicate within one week of receipt of such representation or objection the reasons for non acceptance of the representation or objection to the borrower PROVIDED that the reasons so communicated or the likely action of the secured creditor at the stage of communication of reasons shall not confer any right upon the borrower to prefer an application to <ORG> under section or <ORG> under section A which enables the borrower on receipt of notice under Section of the SARFAESI Act to give his representation or objection which shall be considered by the bank and the decision of the bank as to the acceptability or tenability of such representation or objection shall be communicated to the borrower within one week of receipt of such representation or objection At the same time the said newly introduced provision specifically states that as against such decision taken on the representation no appeal shall be filed under Section or Section A of the SARFAESI Act In case the borrower fails to discharge his liability in full within the period specified in sub section the secured creditor may take recourse to one or more of the following measures to recover his secured debt namely a take possession of the secured assets of the borrower including the right to transfer by way of lease assignment or sale for realising the secured asset take over the management of the business of the borrower including the right to transfer by way of lease assignment or sale for realising the secured asset PROVIDED that the right to transfer by way of lease assignment or sale shall be exercised only where the substantial part of the business of the borrower is held as security for the debt PROVIDED FURTHER that where the management of whole of the business or part of the business is severable the secured creditor shall take over the management of such business of the borrower which is relatable to the security for the debt appoint any person hereafter referred to as the manager to manage the secured assets the possession of which has been taken over by the secured creditor require at any time by notice in writing any person who has acquired any of the secured assets from the borrower and from whom any money is due or may become due to the borrower to pay the secured creditor so much of the money as is sufficient to pay the secured debt the bank or financial institution can resort to the measures to recover the secured debt either by taking possession of the secured assets of the borrower or by taking over the management of the business of the borrower in which case the bank is entitled to appoint a manager as stated therein and in cases where the secured asset is an immovable property the possession notice has to be affixed on the outer door or at a conspicuous place of the property as per Rule of the Security Interest Enforcement Rules which is as follows Rule Where the secured asset is an immovable property the authorised officer shall take or cause to be taken possession by delivering a possession notice prepared as nearly as possible in Appendix IV to these rules to the borrower and by affixing the possession notice on the outer door or at such conspicuous place of the property There are various other sub sections under Section of the SARFAESI Act from Section to Section which are in effect to facilitate the taking of possession under Section of the Act which includes that when a transfer is made by virtue of the power under Section of the SARFAESI Act by the secured creditor the entire right shall vest with the transferee in respect of the secured asset It is as against the measure taken under Section of the SARFAESI Act as stated above <ORG> has held in <ORG> case supra that an appeal lies to <ORG> under Section of the Act Section of the SARFAESI Act specifically excludes certain cases from the application of the SARFAESI Act which are in effect restrictions imposed on the powers of the bank or financial institution in enforcing the security interest But in cases where taking possession of the secured assets by the secured creditor requires certain assistance the secured creditor is entitled to apply by way of a request in writing to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or District Magistrate who by passing an order is entitled to assist the secured creditor in taking possession of the secured assets Therefore while reading Section of the Act extracted above there is no difficulty to conclude that the power of the bank or financial institution to resort to the said provision is only in continuation and after taking possession as per the process enumerated under Section of the SARFAESI Act In cases where the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or District Magistrate is satisfied about the procedure having been followed by the secured creditor but is of the view that certain more steps are to be taken for the purpose of taking possession by using force the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or District Magistrate passes further order directing the police authorities to use necessary force As Section of the SARFAESI Act on the face of it does not contemplate notice to any person before passing such order of assistance it is naturally left to the discretion of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or District Magistrate to decide the nature of force to be used Moreover it is also clear that Section of the SARFAESI Act is not independent and it hinges upon the measures taken by the secured creditor under Section of the SARFAESI Act In the judgment in <ORG> case supra <ORG> has taken note of the fact that the measures contemplated under the SARFAESI Act are no doubt stringent and held that it is the duty of the secured creditor to consider the representation of the borrower It is also true that till the stage of making of the demand and notice under Section of the Act no hearing can be claimed for by the borrower But looking to the stringent nature of measures to be taken without intervention of court with a bar to approach the court or any other forum at that stage it becomes only reasonable that the secured creditor must bear in mind the say of the borrower before such a process of recovery is initiated so as to demonstrate that the reply of the borrower to the notice under Section of the Act has been considered applying mind to it The reasons howsoever brief they may be for not accepting the objections if raised in the reply must be communicated to the borrower True presumption is in favour of validity of an enactment and a legislation may not be declared unconstitutional lightly more so in the matters relating to fiscal and economic policies resorted to in the public interest but while resorting to such legislation it would be necessary to see that the persons aggrieved get a fair deal at the hands of those who have been vested with the powers to enforce drastic steps to make recovery The plea of absence of natural justice lies ill in the mouth of chronic defaulters who have not paid the principal amounts admittedly due to the banks We hope it was not meant to be said that all those who defaulted according to the banks and financial institutions must be condemned unheard who might not deserve any hearing to place their side of the case unless they must go through the crushing preconditions of deposit of of the amount demanded over and above their secured assets already having been taken possession of We feel this can well be one example of hitting below the belt We feel the objections pointed out are not such which render the statute invalid or unconstitutional Such problems about working of any particular provision of the Act in any particular factual situation may be considered as and when they may arise Under the Act in consideration we find that before taking action a notice of days is required to be given and after the measures under Section of the Act have been taken a mechanism has been provided under Section of the Act to approach <ORG> The abovenoted provisions are for the purpose of giving some reasonable protection to the borrower Viewing the matter in the above perspective we find what emerges from different provisions of the Act is as follows After service of notice if the borrower raises any objection or places facts for consideration of the secured creditor such reply to the notice must be considered with due application of mind and the reasons for not accepting the objections howsoever brief they may be must be communicated to the borrower In connection with this conclusion we have already held a discussion in the earlier part of the judgment The reasons so communicated shall only be for the purposes of the information knowledge of the borrower without giving rise to any right to approach <ORG> under Section of the Act at that stage As already discussed earlier on measures having been taken under sub section of Section and before the date of sale auction of the property it would be open for the borrower to file an appeal petition under Section of the Act before <ORG> That the <ORG> in exercise of its ancillary powers shall have jurisdiction to pass any stay interim order subject to the condition as it may deem fit and proper to impose In view of the discussion already held in this behalf we find that the requirement of deposit of of the amount claimed before entertaining an appeal petition under Section of the Act is an oppressive onerous and arbitrary condition against all the canons of reasonableness As discussed earlier in this judgment we find that it will be open to maintain a civil suit in civil court within the narrow scope and on the limited grounds on which they are permissible in the matters relating to an English mortgage enforceable without intervention of the court In view of the discussion held in the judgment and the findings and directions contained in the preceding paragraphs we hold that the borrowers would get a reasonably fair deal and opportunity to get the matter adjudicated upon before <ORG> The effect of some of the provisions may be a bit harsh for some of the borrowers but on that ground the impugned provisions of the Act cannot be said to be unconstitutional in view of the fact that the object of the Act is to achieve speedier recovery of the dues declared as NPAs and better availability of capital liquidity and resources to help in growth of the economy of the country and welfare of the people in general which would subserve the public interest We therefore subject to what is provided in para above uphold the validity of the Act and its provisions except that of sub section of Section of the Act which is declared ultra vires Article of the Constitution of India In such circumstances the contention made by Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the petitioner that <ORG> has not specifically considered the validity of Section of the SARFAESI Act and therefore there is no bar for this Court to consider the same in our considered opinion is not tenable It is well established that even where there is no specific provision in a statute or rules made thereunder for showing cause against action proposed to be taken against an individual which affects the rights of that individual the duty to give reasonable opportunity to be heard will be implied from the nature of the function to be performed by the authority which has the power to take punitive or damaging action It is one of the fundamental rules of our constitutional set up that every citizen is protected against exercise of arbitrary authority by the <ORG> or its officers Duty to act judicially would therefore arise from the very nature of the function intended to be performed it need not be shown to be super added If there is power to decide and determine to the prejudice of a person duty to act judicially is implicit in the exercise of such power If the essentials of justice be ignored and an order to the prejudice of a person is made the order is a nullity That is a basic concept of the rule of law and importance thereof transcends the significance of a decision in any particular case Now the question immediately arises as to what is the requirement of Article what is the content and reach of the great equalising principle enunciated in this article There can be no doubt that it is a founding faith of the Constitution And therefore it must not be subjected to a narrow pedantic or lexicographic approach No attempt should be made to truncate its all embracing scope and meaning for to do so would be to violate its activist magnitude Equality is a dynamic concept with many aspects and dimensions and it cannot be imprisoned within traditional and doctrinaire limits In fact equality and arbitrariness are sworn enemies one belongs to the rule of law in a republic while the other to the whim and caprice of an absolute monarch Article strikes at arbitrariness in <ORG> action and ensures fairness and equality of treatment The principle of reasonableness which legally as well as philosophically is an essential element of equality or non arbitrariness pervades Article like a brooding omnipresence and the procedure contemplated by Article must answer the test of reasonableness in order to be in conformity with Article We may commence the discussion of this question with a few general observations to emphasise the increasing importance of natural justice in the field of administrative law Natural justice is a great humanising principle intended to invest law with fairness and to secure justice and over the years it has grown into a widely pervasive rule affecting large areas of administrative action Lord <NAME> of <ORG> spoke of this rule in eloquent terms in his address before <ORG> We can I think take pride in what has been done in recent periods and particularly in the field of administrative law by invoking and by applying these principles which we broadly classify under the designation of natural justice Does natural justice qualify to be described as a majestic conception I believe it does Is it just a rhetorical but vague phrase which can be employed when needed to give a gloss of assurance I believe that it is very much more If it can be summarised as being fair play in action who could wish that it would ever be out of action It denotes that the law is not only to be guided by reason and by logic but that its purpose will not be fulfilled it lacks more exalted inspiration We often speak of the rules of natural justice But there is nothing rigid or mechanical about them But any analysis must bring into relief rather their spirit and their inspiration than any precision of definition or precision as to application We do not search for prescriptions which will lay down exactly what must in various divergent situations be done Nor do we wait for directions from <ORG> The common law has abundant riches there may we find what <NAME> called the justice of the common law Thus the soul of natural justice is fair play in action and that is why it has received the widest recognition throughout the democratic world In the United States the right to an administrative hearing is regarded as essential requirement of fundamental fairness And in England too it has been held that fair play in action demands that before any prejudicial or adverse action is taken against a person he must be given an opportunity to be heard The rule was stated by Lord <NAME> MR in these terms in <NAME> Secretary of State or Home Affairs Ch where a public officer has power to deprive a person of his liberty or his property the general principle is that it has not to be done without his being given an opportunity of being heard and of making representations on his own behalf It has even gained access to <ORG> vide American Journal of International Law Vol It is the quintessence of the process of justice inspired and guided by fair play in action If we look at the speeches of the various Law Lords in <NAME> case it will be seen that each one of them asked the question whether in the particular circumstances of the case the <ORG> acted unfairly so that it could be said that their procedure did not match with what justice demanded or was the procedure adopted by the <ORG> in all the circumstances unfair The test adopted by every Law Lord was whether the procedure followed was fair in all the circumstances and fair play in action required that an opportunity should be given to the taxpayer to see and reply to the counter statement of the Commissioners before reaching the conclusion that there is a prima facie case against him The inquiry must therefore always be does fairness in action demand that an opportunity to be heard should be given to the person affected <ORG> has also held that in applying the principles of natural justice there is no distinction between a quasi judicial function and administrative function in the following words It is a settled legal proposition that Article of the Constitution strikes at arbitrariness because an action that is arbitrary must necessarily involve negation of equality This doctrine of arbitrariness is not restricted only to executive actions but also applies to the legislature Honesty of purpose of those who prepared and published the list was not and is not challenged but the validity of a law which apparently infringes the fundamental rights of citizens cannot be upheld merely because the lawmaker was satisfied that what he did was right or that he believes that he acted in manner consistent with the constitutional guarantees of the citizen The test of the validity of a law alleged to infringe the fundamental rights of a citizen or any act done in execution of that law lies not in the belief of the maker of the law or of the person executing the law but in the demonstration by evidence and argument before the courts that the guaranteed right is not infringed The rule of law as a principle contains no explicit substantive component like eminent domain but has many shades and colours Violation of principle of natural justice may undermine the rule of law resulting in arbitrariness unreasonableness etc but such violations may not undermine the rule of law so as to invalidate a statute Violation must be of such a serious nature which undermines the very basic structure of our Constitution and our democratic principles But once the court finds a statute undermines the rule of law which has the status of a constitutional principle like the basic structure the above grounds are also available and not vice versa Any law which in the opinion of the court is not just fair and reasonable is not a ground to strike down a statute because such an approach would always be subjective not the will of the people because there is always a presumption of constitutionality for a statute Let the message therefore be loud and clear that the rule of law exists in this country even when we interpret a statute which has the blessings of Article A It is no doubt true that by applying the above said celebrated concept which has been throughout well established by judicial precedents in this country the consequences of an order passed by the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or District Magistrate under Section of the SARFAESI Act especially relating to the force to be used for the purpose of taking possession under Section of the SARFAESI Act without giving opportunity to the person who is in occupation is ostensibly draconian But in the light of the decision of <ORG> in <ORG> case supra upholding the validity of the SARFAESI Act in our view it is not for this Court to reexamine one of the provisions of the SARFAESI Act The above said observation had to be made in the context of some of the events like cases where the possession of the secured asset is in the hands of a bona fide tenant who was inducted by the borrower long before either the borrowal of the amount by the landlord or any action taken by the bank under the provisions of the SARFAESI Act In such unfortunate event since the tenant in occupation is not entitled to know about the classification of the dues as non performing asset or a notice under Section of the Act apart from possession notice under Section of the Act certainly he may be in the dark about the entire event except for the first time when the secured creditor approaches the tenant in occupation with the help of an order passed by Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or District Magistrate under Section of the SARFAESI Act to use force to throw him away Even if an appeal can be filed by such a tenant to <ORG> under Section of the SARFAESI Act which uses the words any person the jurisdiction of <ORG> is restricted to find out as to whether the provisions of the SARFAESI Act have been followed scrupulously or not and there is no provision for <ORG> to decide as to whether the occupant being a bona fide tenant is liable to be removed from the place for the purpose of securing the secured asset by the secured creditor There is also possibility for certain unscrupulous landlords to take advantage of the draconian provision of Section of the SARFAESI Act in order to take possession from a tenant who is entitled to protection under the Tamil Nadu Buildings Lease and Rent Control Act by borrowing an amount from a bank of financial institution wantonly committing default and thereby obtaining an order through the secured creditor under Section of the SARFAESI Act to throw away the bona fide tenant Strongly denouncing the conduct of <ORG> in interfering under Article of the Constitution of India with an order passed under Sections and of the SARFAESI Act <ORG> has observed as follows There is another reason why the impugned order should be set aside If Respondent had any tangible grievance against the notice issued under Section or action taken under Section then she could have availed remedy by filing an application under Section The expression any person used in Section is of wide import It takes within its fold not only the borrower but also the guarantor or any other person who may be affected by the action taken under Section or Section Both the <ORG> and the Appellate <ORG> are empowered to pass interim orders under Sections and and are required to decide the matters within a fixed time schedule Unfortunately <ORG> overlooked the settled law that <ORG> will ordinarily not entertain a petition under Article of the Constitution if an effective remedy is available to the aggrieved person and that this rule applies with greater rigour in matters involving recovery of taxes cess fees other types of public money and the dues of banks and other financial institutions In our view while dealing with the petitions involving challenge to the action taken for recovery of the public dues etc <ORG> must keep in mind that the legislations enacted by <ORG> and State Legislatures for recovery of such dues are a code unto themselves inasmuch as they not only contain comprehensive procedure for recovery of the dues but also envisage constitution of quasi judicial bodies for redressal of the grievance of any aggrieved person Therefore in all such cases <ORG> must insist that before availing remedy under Article of the Constitution a person must exhaust the remedies available under the relevant statute Therefore it is clear that even against an order of possession taken through the administrative fiat from the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or District Magistrate an application under Section of the SARFAESI Act can be filed by any person affected which includes a tenant in lawful occupation to <ORG> The courts should not place reliance on decisions without discussing as to how the factual situation fits in with the fact situation of the decision on which reliance is placed These observations must be read in the context in which they appear to have been stated To interpret words phrases and provisions of a statute it may become necessary for Judges to embark into lengthy discussions but the discussion is meant to explain and not to define Judges interpret statutes they do not interpret judgments They interpret words of statutes their words are not to be interpreted as statutes A decision passes sub silentio in the technical sense that has come to be attached to that phrase when the particular point of law involved in the decision is not perceived by the <ORG> or present to its mind The <ORG> may consciously decide in favour of one party because of Point A which it considers and pronounces upon It may be shown however that logically the court should not have decided in favour of the particular party unless it also decided Point in his favour but Point was not argued or considered by the <ORG> In such circumstances although Point was logically involved in the facts and although the case had a specific outcome the decision is not an authority on Point Point is said to pass sub silentio The aforesaid passage has been quoted with approval by the three Judge Bench in <NAME> This <ORG> in <NAME> in order to illustrate the aforesaid proposition further relied on the decision of <ORG> in <NAME> <NAME> of Paris Ltd All ER CA The <ORG> found that no consideration was given to the question whether a garnishee order could be passed Therefore a point in respect of which no argument was advanced and no citation of authority was made is not binding and would not be followed This <ORG> held that such decisions which are treated having been passed sub silentio and without argument are of no moment The <ORG> further explained the position by saying that one of the chief reasons behind the doctrine of precedent is that once a matter is fully argued and decided the same should not be reopened and mere casual expressions carry no weight But when <ORG> has considered the validity of the SARFAESI Act as a whole even though no express opinion has been made by <ORG> about Section of the SARFAESI Act and the vires of the SARFAESI Act has been upheld in the guise of applying the principle of sub silentio it is not possible for this <ORG> to go into the validity of Section of the SARFAESI Act As stated by <NAME> on Jurisprudence elicited above may be in cases where a point of law involved in the decision is not perceived by the <ORG> and the <ORG> while deciding a particular point has made a reference about another point the principle of sub silentio may be made applicable in respect of another point relating to which a reference has been made But at the same time we are of the view that when once greater power has been conferred on the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or District Magistrate under Section of the Act the same has to be exercised by the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or District Magistrate with greater care and onerous responsibility Even though it is true that it is only after exercise of its power under Section of the SARFAESI Act by giving notice of possession by the bank or financial institution such secured creditor can proceed under Section of the SARFAESI Act only in cases where it is necessary to obtain such assistance from the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or District Magistrate in our view before exercising such power under Section of the SARFAESI Act which obviously does not require any notice to anyone the authority must cogitate on and analyze the following aspects i that even after giving notice under Section of the SARFAESI Act the secured creditor requires assistance from the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or District Magistrate under Section of the SARFAESI Act ii that while classifying the due as non performing asset the bank or financial institution has followed the procedure contemplated under the SARFAESI Act iii that notice under Section of the SARFAESI Act was in fact given to the borrower in accordance with the Rules including paper publication affixture etc by giving him sixty days time as contemplated therein and such notice has been received by the borrower and it contains the details of the amount payable by the borrower etc iv that in case any representation has been made by the borrower under Section A of the SARFAESI Act the secured creditor bank or financial institution has replied within one week that notice of possession under Section of the SARFAESI Act has been given and vi that in cases where the borrower or guarantor is not in possession of the secured asset whether the bank or financial institution has scrupulously followed Rule of the Security Interest Enforcement Rules in affixing the possession notice and if necessary direct the bank or financial institution to inform about the affixture of possession notice under Rule of the Security Interest Enforcement Rules to the tenant in occupation and also in that event direct the bank or financial institution to give such tenant sufficient time to file appeal under Section of the SARFAESI Act to <ORG> and thereafter the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or District Magistrate should pass appropriate orders and such order shall contain laconically the above said considerations to evince that there has been an application of mind by the authority This is necessary as <ORG> has held that even against the possession notice under Section and order under Section of the SARFAESI Act a person aggrieved can approach <ORG> under Section of the SARFAESI Act A consideration of the above said aspects will be helpful to prevent a bona fide tenant who has been in occupation for a long time from being thrown out arbitrarily without his knowledge due to the default committed by the borrower who happens to be a landlord It behooves us to lay down the above said exhaustive guidelines as an extraordinary power has been conferred on the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or District Magistrate under Section of the SARFAESI Act of course in order to achieve the main goal of the SARFAESI Act itself as stated above Such trust and confidence should not be frittered away by unnecessary and unwarranted show or exercise of power Greater the power greater should be the responsibility in exercising such power While rejecting the contention that there is a dichotomy between symbolic possession and physical possession under the SARFAESI Act <ORG> has held that there is no distinction under the SARFAESI Act and has taken note of the fact that the third party interest are created overnight in order to scuttle the enforcement of the provisions of the SARFAESI Act The dichotomy between symbolic and physical possession does not find place in the Act As stated above there is a conceptual distinction between securities by which the creditor obtains ownership of or interest in the property concerned mortgages and securities where the creditor obtains neither an interest in nor possession of the property but the property is appropriated to the satisfaction of the debt charges Basically the NPA Act deals with the former type of securities under which the secured creditor namely the bank FI obtains interest in the property concerned It is for this reason that the NPA Act ousts the intervention of the courts tribunals Keeping the above conceptual aspect in mind we find that Section of the NPA Act proceeds on the basis that the borrower who is under a liability has failed to discharge his liability within the period prescribed under Section which enables the secured creditor to take recourse to one of the measures namely taking possession of the secured assets including the right to transfer by way of lease assignment or sale for realising the secured assets Section A refers to the word possession simpliciter There is no dichotomy in sub section A as pleaded on behalf of the borrowers Under Rule of the Rules the authorised officer is empowered to take possession by delivering the possession notice prepared as nearly as possible in Appendix IV to the Rules That notice is required to be affixed on the property Rule deals with sale of immovable secured assets Appendix IV prescribes the form of possession notice It inter alia states that notice is given to the borrower who has failed to repay the amount informing him and the public that the bank FI has taken possession of the property under Section read with Rule of the Rules Rule relates to time of sale issue of sale certificate and delivery of possession Rule states that on confirmation of sale if the terms of payment are complied with the authorised officer shall issue a sale certificate in favour of the purchaser in the form given in Appendix to the Rules Rule states that the authorised officer shall deliver the property to the buyer free from all encumbrances known to the secured creditor or not known to the secured creditor emphasis supplied Section of the NPA Act states that where the possession of any secured asset is required to be taken by the secured creditor or if any of the secured asset is required to be sold or transferred the secured creditor may for the purpose of taking possession request in writing to the District Magistrate to take possession thereof Section of the NPA Act refers to the right of appeal Section states that if <ORG> as an appellate authority after examining the facts and circumstances of the case comes to the conclusion that any of the measures under Section taken by the secured creditor are not in accordance with the provisions of the Act it may by order declare that the recourse taken to any one or more measures is invalid and consequently restore possession to the borrower and can also restore management of the business of the borrower Therefore the scheme of Section read with Section shows that if the borrower is dispossessed not in accordance with the provisions of the Act then <ORG> is entitled to put the clock back by restoring the status quo ante Therefore it cannot be said that if possession is taken before confirmation of sale the rights of the borrower to get the dispute adjudicated upon is defeated by the authorised officer taking possession As stated above the NPA Act provides for recovery of possession by non adjudicatory process therefore to say that the rights of the borrower would be defeated without adjudication would be erroneous Rule undoubtedly refers to sale of immovable secured asset However Rule indicates that where possession is taken by the authorised officer before issuance of sale certificate under Rule the authorised officer shall take steps for preservation and protection of secured assets till they are sold or otherwise disposed of Under Section if the dues of the secured creditor together with all costs charges and expenses incurred by him are tendered to the creditor before the date fixed for sale or transfer the asset shall not be sold or transferred The costs charges and expenses referred to in Section will include costs charges and expenses which the authorised officer incurs for preserving and protecting the secured assets till they are sold or disposed of in terms of Rule Thus Rule deals with the stage anterior to the issuance of sale certificate and delivery of possession under Rule The Court Receiver can take symbolic possession and in appropriate cases where the Court Receiver finds that a third party interest is likely to be created overnight he can take actual possession even prior to the decree The authorised officer under Rule has greater powers than even a Court Receiver as security interest in the property is already created in favour of the banks FIs Therefore Rule provides that till issuance of the sale certificate under Rule the authorised officer shall take such steps as he deems fit to preserve the secured asset It is well settled that third party interests are created overnight and in very many cases those third parties take up the defence of being a bona fide purchaser for value without notice It is these types of disputes which are sought to be avoided by Rule read with Rule of the Rules In the circumstances the drawing of dichotomy between symbolic and actual possession does not find place in the scheme of the NPA Act read with the Rules a The DRT Act did not provide for assignment of debts to securitisation companies The secured assets could not be liquidated in time The NPA Act was enacted to reduce mounting non performing assets by empowering banks to liquidate the assets and secured interest The NPA Act deals with crystallized liabilities The NPA Act proceeds on the basis that the asset is created in favour of bank which could be assigned to the assets management company which steps into the shoes of the secured creditors Section proceeds on the basis that the borrower is under a liability and his account in the books of account of the bank is classified as sub standard or doubtful or loss The NPA Act comes into force only if these two conditions are satisfied Since Section deals with liquidation of liability on the basis that the account of the borrower has become non performing there is no scope of any dispute regarding liability The NPA Act does not deal with disputes between the secured creditors and the borrowers but it deals with the rights of the secured creditors inter se Section and Section of the NPA Act proceed on the basis that the security interest in the bank and financial institution needs to be enforced expeditiously without the intervention of the <ORG> and that enforcement could take place by non adjudicatory process The NPA Act provides for recovery of possession by non adjudicatory process The NPA Act removes all fetters on the right of the secured creditor i Under Section the <ORG> is required to consider whether any of the measures referred to in Section are in accordance with the provisions of the NPA Act and the Rules made thereunder If while examining the application under Section the DRT comes to the conclusion that any of the measures taken under Section are not in accordance with NPA Act it shall direct the secured creditor to restore the possession to the borrower or restore management to the borrower If the <ORG> declares that the recourse taken under Section is in accordance with the provisions of the NPA Act then notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force the secured creditor shall be entitled to take recourse to anyone or more of the measures as specified under Section to recover his secured debt Section shows that the secured creditor is free to take recourse to any one of the measures under Section notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force for the sake of argument if in a given case the measures undertaken by the secured creditor under Section come in conflict with the <ORG> land revenue law then notwithstanding such conflict the provision of Section shall override the local law This position stands clarified by Section of the NPA Act which states that the provisions of the NPA Act shall override all other laws which are inconsistent with the NPA Act Section gives an overriding effect to the NPA Act over all other laws if they are in consistent with it The dichotomy between symbolic and physical possession does not find place in the NPA Act Rule of the said Rules deals with the sale of immovable secured assets Rule deals with the stage anterior to the issuance of sale certificate and delivery of possession under Rule Rule relates to time of sale issue of sale certificate and delivery of possession The court receiver can take symbolic possession and in appropriate cases he can take actual possession even prior to the decree The authorised officer powers are greater as security interest is already created in the bank Hence under Rule he can take steps to preserve the secured asset till issuance of the sale certificate under Rule Rule states that on confirmation of sale if the terms of payment are complied with the authorised officer shall issue a sale certificate in favour of the purchaser Rule states that the authorised officer shall deliver the property to the buyer free from all encumbrances known to the secured creditor or not known to the secured creditor This scheme of the NPA Act therefore does not disclose any dichotomy between symbolic possession and physical possession Since scheme of Section read with Section shows that if the borrower is dispossessed not in accordance with the provisions of the NPA Act the DRT is entitled to restore status quo ante it cannot be said that if possession is taken before confirmation of sale the rights of the borrower to get the dispute adjudicated upon is defeated by the authorised officer taking possession The disputes which are sought to be avoided by Rule read with Rule of the said Rules are those where third party interests are created overnight and in very many cases those third parties take up the defence of being a bonafide purchaser for value without notice Section of the Act provides that the secured creditor can file an application before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or the District Magistrate within whose jurisdiction the secured asset or other documents relating thereto are found for taking possession thereof If any such request is made the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or the District Magistrate as the case may be is obliged to take possession of such asset or document and forward the same to the secured creditor Therefore it follows that a secured creditor may in order to enforce his rights under Section in particular Section a may take recourse to Section of the Act It is manifest that an action under Section of the Act constitutes an action taken after the stage of Section and therefore the same would fall within the ambit of Section of the Act Thus the Act itself contemplates an efficacious remedy for the borrower or any person affected by an action under Section of the Act by providing for an appeal before the DRT In view of the judgments of <ORG> commencing from <ORG> case to <ORG> case supra wherein <ORG> has analyzed threadbare the various provisions of the SARFAESI Act we are unable to accept the contention of Mr <NAME> learned counsel appearing for the petitioner in No of for a declaration that Section of the SARFAESI Act is null and void except issuing certain guidelines as stated above Accordingly No of stands dismissed and Section of the SARFAESI Act is held valid However while exercising the power by way of measure to assist the bank or financial institution to secure the secured assets the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or District Magistrate shall follow the following guidelines i that even after giving notice under Section of the SARFAESI Act the secured creditor requires assistance from the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or District Magistrate under Section of the SARFAESI Act ii that while classifying the due as non performing asset the bank or financial institution has followed the procedure contemplated under the SARFAESI Act iii that a notice under Section of the SARFAESI Act was in fact given to the borrower in accordance with the Rules including paper publication affixture etc by giving him sixty days time as contemplated therein and such notice has been received by the borrower and it contains the details of the amount payable by the borrower etc Now coming to the individual cases wherein the orders of the Chief Judicial Magistrates are challenged it is true that as against the measure taken under Section of the SARFAESI Act any person affected can approach <ORG> under Section of the SARFAESI Act which states any person including the borrower as it seen in Section of the SARFAESI Act which is as follows Section Any person including borrower aggrieved by any of the measures referred to in sub section of section taken by the secured creditor or his authorised officer under this Chapter may make an application along with such fee as may be prescribed to <ORG> having jurisdiction in the matter within forty five days from the date on which such measure had been taken PROVIDED that different fees may be prescribed for making the application by the borrower and the person other than the borrower Explanation For the removal of doubts it is hereby declared that the communication of the reasons to the borrower by the secured creditor for not having accepted his representation or objection or the likely action of the secured creditor at the stage of communication of reasons to the borrower shall not entitle the person including borrower to make an application to <ORG> under this sub section Of course it is because of that provision <ORG> has clarified that an appeal lies to <ORG> against the order passed under Section of the SARFAESI Act But at the same time when the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or District Magistrate while considering such request from the secured creditor failed to follow the provisions of the SARFAESI Act and exercised his discretion in an improper manner or in cases where the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or District Magistrate simply as an administrative authority without application of mind merely on the request of the secured creditor passes an order appointing an Advocate Commissioner to take possession with the help of police without considering anything about the fulfillment of the requirements under the SARFAESI Act it cannot be said that this Court cannot entertain a writ petition under Article of the Constitution of India especially when gross injustice is sought to be done by such measure taken by the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or District Magistrate under Section of the SARFAESI Act Right to appeal Any person including borrower aggrieved by any of the measures referred to in sub section of section taken by the secured creditor or his authorised officer under this Chapter may make an application alongwith such fee as may be prescribed to <ORG> having jurisdiction in the matter within forty five days from the date on which such measure had been taken PROVIDED that different fees may be prescribed for making the application by the borrower and the person other than the borrower Explanation For the removal of doubts it is hereby declared that the communication of the reasons to the borrower by the secured creditor for not having accepted his representation or objection or the likely action of the secured creditor at the stage of communication of reasons to the borrower shall not entitle the person including borrower to make an application to <ORG> under this sub section <ORG> shall consider whether any of the measures referred to in sub section of section taken by the secured creditor for enforcement of security are in accordance with the provisions of this Act and the rules made thereunder If <ORG> after examining the facts and circumstances of the case and evidence produced by the parties comes to the conclusion that any of the measures referred to in sub section of section taken by the secured creditor are not in accordance with the provisions of this Act and the rules made thereunder and require restoration of the management of the business to the borrower or restoration of possession of the secured assets to the borrower it may by order declare the recourse to any one or more measures referred to in sub section of section taken by the secured creditors as invalid and restore the possession of the secured assets to the borrower or restore the management of the business to the borrower as the case may be and pass such order as it may consider appropriate and necessary in relation to any of the recourse taken by the secured creditor under sub section of section If <ORG> declares the recourse taken by a secured creditor under sub section of section is in accordance with the provisions of this Act and the rules made thereunder then notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force the secured creditor shall be entitled to take recourse to one or more of the measures specified under sub section of section to recover his secured debt Any application made under sub section shall be dealt with by <ORG> as expeditiously as possible and disposed of within sixty days from the date of such application PROVIDED that <ORG> may from time to time extend the said period for reasons to be recorded in writing so however that the total period of pendency of the application with <ORG> shall not exceed four months from the date of making of such application made under sub section If the application is not disposed of by <ORG> within the period of four months as specified in sub section any part to the application may make an application in such form as may be prescribed to <ORG> for directing <ORG> for expeditious disposal of the application pending before <ORG> and <ORG> may on such application make an order for expeditious disposal of the pending application by <ORG> Save as otherwise provided in this Act <ORG> shall as far as may be dispose of the application in accordance with the provisions of the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act and the rules made thereunder one can certainly come to a conclusion that the power of <ORG> under Section of the SARFAESI Act even though it enables any person affected by an order under Section or consequently under Section of the SARFAESI Act to approach it is restricted to the confirmation to the provisions of the SARFAESI Act alone Ergo in cases where a bona fide tenant is sought to be evicted either by the steps taken under Section of the SARFAESI Act by the secured creditor or by the order of assistance passed by the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or District Magistrate under Section of the SARFAESI Act at the instance of the secured creditor it is highly doubtful as to whether <ORG> can go into the question as to whether the third party tenant is a bona fide tenant or not since <ORG> is not expected to follow the elaborate procedure of <ORG> and is expected to proceed on summary basis taking into consideration the object of the SARFAESI Act Therefore in such cases in order to render substantial justice we are of the view that there is no bar for this Court to entertain a writ petition under Article of the Constitution of India But insofar as it relates to the borrower or guarantor as against the steps taken by the secured creditor under Sections and of the SARFAESI Act Section of the SARFAESI Act provides an effective alternative remedy and in such cases it is not possible for this Court to entertain a writ petition In the above case <ORG> found that since there was no specific provision creating first charge in respect of the amount due to the bank in the SARFAESI Act such provision contained in the <ORG> enactment creating first charge in respect of the dues to the Government shall not indicate any conflict or inconsistency or overlapping between the same In the case on hand as we have already stated there is no specific provision in the SARFAESI Act in respect of taking possession from the hands of the tenant Thus they are traceable to two different entries in their respective fields and there is neither any conflict nor repugnancy or overlapping In such view of the matter there is no difficulty in holding that the bank cannot take physical possession from the tenant protected under Tamil Nadu Rent Control Act by invoking the provisions of Sections and of the SARFAESI Act in the event the tenant is in bona fide occupation It is in the above backdrop we take up the individual cases The bank has issued a notice under Section of the SARFAESI Act claiming an outstanding of under cash credit loan and under housing loan and thereafter issued a notice under Section of the SARFAESI Act as per Rule of the Security Interest Enforcement Rules on claiming a total amount of and on the bank approaching the Chief Judicial Magistrate <NAME> under Section of the SARFAESI Act the Chief Judicial Magistrate after recording the evidence of the Manager of the Bank who has produced in his evidence notice issued under Section of the SARFAESI Act apart from the possession notice issued under Section of the SARFAESI Act as it is affixed and published in two newspapers has passed an order after perusing the records and sworn statement of the authorised officer directing <NAME> to render necessary assistance to the secured creditor in respect of the secured property After gleaning the entire materials made available with the court and upon hearing the petitioner the court is fully satisfied with a need to render necessary assistance to the secured creditor in taking over the secured assets All the legal formalities have already been complied with scrupulously and accordingly this court is inclined to confer the relief sought for by the petitioner under section of the SARFAESI Act Inasmuch as the petitioner is a borrower and there is nothing to conclude that the Chief Judicial Magistrate has not applied his mind and inasmuch the petitioner has got an effective alternative remedy of filing an appeal under Section of the SARFAESI Act No of stands dismissed with liberty to the petitioner to approach <ORG> under Section of the SARFAESI Act making it clear that if such appeal is filed within a period of four weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order <ORG> shall receive the said appeal and decide the same on merits and in accordance with law independent of any observation made above Even though the petitioner is a tenant he has not stated in the affidavit filed in support of the writ petition as to the period of his tenancy except producing an unregistered rental agreement dated However it appears as it is seen in the application filed by the first respondent bank under Section of the SARFAESI Act before the Chief Judicial Magistrate <NAME> that the second respondent has created a mortgage in the year In such circumstances this Court cannot decide the bona fide nature of the petitioner as a tenant under the second respondent and therefore giving liberty to the petitioner to approach <ORG> under Section of the SARFAESI Act or to approach the appropriate forum in any other manner known to law the writ petition stands dismissed It is made clear that if the petitioner resorts to such legal recourse within four weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order the authority concerned shall decide the issue on merits and in accordance with law It is further made clear that after the said period of four weeks if the petitioner is unable to get any legal protection from the competent authority it shall be open to the bank to proceed in accordance with law The petitioners in this writ petition are claiming to be the tenants under the second respondent who is stated to have borrowed from the first respondent bank by way of cash credit facility an amount of Crores and by way of term loan facility an amount of on A claim was made to the extent of on and possession notice under Section of the SARFAESI Act was served on Inasmuch as the said unregistered rental agreements are dated immediately before the date of borrowal this Court cannot decide while exercising the power under Article of the Constitution of India about the bona fide nature of the petitioners tenants and therefore giving liberty to the petitioners to approach <ORG> under Section of the SARFAESI Act or to approach the appropriate forum in any other manner known to law the writ petition stands dismissed It is made clear that if the petitioners resort to such legal recourse within four weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order the authority concerned shall decide the issue on merits and in accordance with law It is further made clear that after the said period of four weeks if the petitioners are unable to get any legal protection from the competent authority it shall be open to the bank to proceed in accordance with law In this case also the unregistered rental agreements and are all dated immediately before the date of borrowal and therefore this <ORG> while exercising the power under Article of the Constitution of India cannot decide about the bona fide nature of the petitioners tenants and therefore giving liberty to the petitioners to approach <ORG> under Section of the SARFAESI Act or to approach the appropriate forum in any other manner known to law the writ petition stands dismissed It is made clear that if the petitioners resort to such legal recourse within four weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order the authority concerned shall decide the issue on merits and in accordance with law It is further made clear that after the said period of four weeks if the petitioners are unable to get any legal protection from the competent authority it shall be open to the bank to proceed in accordance with law In the result all the writ petitions are dismissed with the above observations
