It is well settled that the succession to temple offices is governed by user which is taken to represent the intentions of the founder and it is not disputed that in this part of India the user in the case of temple archakas is that the office is hereditary and descends in the ordinary course of succession to women who are not themselves competent to perform the duties of the office by ministering in the temple and perform them by deputy The archakas were gossains and there was a usage among them that females continued to belong to their father kul or family after marriage No question arose in that case as to the right of the widow and her daughter after her to fill the office and it does not appear whether while they held it they performed the duties in person or by deputy What their Lordships had to consider was whether on the daughter death the office should go to her son and her descendants a line of heirs who as <NAME> would be incapable of performing its duties or should revert to the male heirs of the last male holder Their Lordships at observe The rule as to the shebaitship being vested in the heir of the founder must from the very nature of the right be subject to the condition that the devolution in the ordinary line of descent is not inconsistent with or opposed to the purpose the founder had in view in establishing the worship and they say later on at page that to allow the plaintiff claim to an admittedly Ballav temple where the rights are performed according to Ballav ritual which it is clearly established they cannot perform would in their Lordships judgment defeat the purpose for which the worship was established A contrary decision would have involved the devolution of the office to a line of heirs incompetent to perform its duties I do not consider that this decision of their Lordships warrants us in overruling the numerous decisions of this <ORG> in conformity with the decisions of other <ORG>s by which the widow and daughter of the last male archaka are held entitled in accordance with the established user to succeed to the office of archaka discharging its duties by deputy and to transmit it to their heirs who as male heirs are preferred to female will generally be competent to perform the duties in person <NAME> for whose opinion I have a great respect considers if I rightly understand him that the established custom of female succession to this office is of so mischievous and objectionable a character that it cannot have been intended by the founder On the contrary it seems to me clear from the report that the out of date unshastraic custom obtaining in the South by which Dharmapathnies who are Sahadharmacharinees of their husbands are considered incompetent to pronounce mantrams and do religious duties along with and even solely in the absence of their husbands does not obtain among the Ballavacharya Grossains one of the Vnishnavite sects which are in several respects much more liberal in the treatment of women and birth sudras than other sects though many Vaishnavite sects might have become very degenerate in other respects A general rule has been laid down by their Lordships of <ORG> that where a person is incompetent to perform the rites of a religious office it would defeat the very purpose for which the worship was established if he including of course she is allowed to inherit the office Though law is not always logical and though the narrow point referred to us relates to inheritance by a person incompetent by reason of sex alone for performing the duties of a religious office I do not think that considerations of the difficulties which are aggressively prominent when we take the four analogous cases of a male heir being incompetent by reason of conversion to another faith when the inheritance opens of his becoming incompetent after the inheritance opens of a female heir being incompetent by reason of conversion before the inheritance opens and becoming incompetent after the inheritance opens can be kept out of mind in deciding the present reference especially having regard to the provisions of Act XXI of Coming to the weight to be given to practice and usage many pernicious and unshastraic usages have crept into the Hindu religions and social systems during dark medieval days and through efflux of time I respectfully agree with my Lord that the law as at present settled by the decisions of <ORG> is that unless the usages in connexion with religious institutions and offices are manifestly immoral or opposed to public policy or opposed to the intentions of the founders of a religious trust or manifestly injurious to the trust the <ORG> are not entitled to go back for the law to the purer more liberal and more ancient shastraic fountain heads It is on this question that I feel that there is real and substantial difference of opinion between myself and the learned Judges who have considered this question in this <ORG> since Thus when the usually small remuneration in rice and cash attached to the archaka office does not go to the deputy who does duties the deputy cannot be expected to perform the duties at all satisfactorily Without laying down any rule as to particular institutions in which there may be a special custom that females cannot succeed to the office and emoluments the trend of decisions in this Court has certainly been to treat females as competent to succeed to the archakaship of Hindu temples in this Presidency I do not think it contains reasons of such weight as to justify a departure from the principle of stare decisis I would answer the question referred to us in the negative
