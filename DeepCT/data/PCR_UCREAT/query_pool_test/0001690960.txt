<NAME> the Appellant before us by Special Leave purchased some lease hold land for Rs As this is the sole question on merits raised by the appellant before us for consideration we will only mention those facts which are relevant for it decision <ORG> and the Court of first appeal having held that the rule of lis pendens applied to the sales mentioned above the appellant purchaser had filed a second appeal in <ORG> which was substantially dismissed by a learned Judge of that Court on after a modification of the decree But the appellant after obtaining certified copies of the judgment and decree of <ORG> sent a letter to the <ORG> that the case be listed again for obtaining a certificate of fitness to file a Letters Patent appeal The case was therefore listed before the learned Judge and an oral application which was then made for grant of a certificate was rejected on on the ground that it had not been made at the proper time It was contended on behalf of the respondent that in the circumstances stated above the appellant must be deemed to have been satisfied with the Judgment of the High Court as his Counsel did not ask for leave to file a Letters Patent appeal as required by Order IV Rule of the Rules of the Madras High Court that is to say immediately after the judgment has been delivered were cited to contend that the appeal before us should be rejected in limine Normally an application for special leave against a second appellate decision would not be granted unless the remedy of a Letters Patent Appeal has been a vaild of In fact no appeal against second appellate decisions appears to be contemplated by the Constitution as is evident from the fact that Article expressly provides that normally an appeal will not lie to this Court from the judgment decree or final order of one Judge of <ORG> It is only where an application for special leave against a second appellate judgment raises issues of law of general importance that the Court would grant the application and proceed to deal with the merits of the contentions raised by the appellant But even in such cases it is necessary that the remedy by way of a Letters Patent Appeal must be resorted to before a party comes to this Court It is submitted that the rule conflicts with the provisions of Clause of the Letters Patent of the Madras High Court requiring only that the Judge who passed the judgment should declare that the case is fit one for appeal as a condition for appealing It was urged that the period of limitation for filing an appeal should not in effect be cut down by a rule such as the one found in Rule Order IV of the Rules of Madras High Court As applications for certification fell outside the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code and there was no specific provision for them in the Limitation Act <ORG> could frame its own rule prescribing the mode and time for making such applications In some <ORG> there is no rule of the <ORG> laying down that the application should be oral and made immediately after the judgment has been delivered It is however evident that a rule such as Rule of Order IV <ORG> is most useful and necessary particularly when a period of thirty days only for filing an appeal has been prescribed in In a suitable case where a party is able to prove that it was prevented due to some cause beyond its control from asking for leave at the proper time the Judge concerned may condone noncompliance by a party with Rule Order IV of <ORG> or extend time by applying Section of the Limitation Act There is however another answer to the preliminary objection It was contended that the case before us is covered by what was laid down by this Court in <NAME> case Supra when it said at page we do not think it would be possible to lay down an unqualified rule that leave should not be granted if the party has not moved for leave under the Letters Patent and it cannot be so granted nor is it possible to lay down an inflexible rule that if in such a case leave has been granted it must always and necessarily be revoked Having regard to the wide scope of the powers conferred on this <ORG> under Article it is not possible and indeed it would not be expedient to lay down any general rule which would govern all cases The question as to whether the jurisdiction of this <ORG> under Article should be exercised or not and if yes on what terms and conditions is a matter which this <ORG> has to decide on the facts of each case In that particular case this <ORG> had actually heard and allowed the appeal by Special leave because it he that there was no general inflexible rule that special leave should be refused where the appellant has not exhausted his rights by asking for a certificate of fitness of a case and because that case called for interference In the case before us although the appellant was not shown to have attempted any explanation of failure to apply for the certificate at the proper time yet the special leave petition having been granted and the case having passed without objection beyond the stage of interim orders and printing of the records we have heard arguments on merits also The challenge on the ground of lis pendens which had been accepted by the Courts in Madras right up to <ORG> was directed against two kinds of sales firstly there was the ostensibly voluntary sale of under a sale deed by the defendant <NAME> and his major son <NAME> and three minor sons <NAME> <NAME> alias Thanikachalam and <NAME> in favour of the defendant appellant and secondly there was the sale evidenced by the sale certificate Exhibit of showing that the auction sale was held in order to realise certain arrears under hire purchase system due to Shri <NAME> The words due to must in the context be read as due from because falsa demonstration non nocet in favour of <NAME> and he had executed a second mortgage in respect of one item of property of Schedule in favour of <NAME> who had assigned his rights to <NAME> A third mortgage of the first item of Schedule properties was executed on by <NAME> in favour of the appellant <NAME> was said to be necessitated by the need to pay arrears of Rs The appellant had obtained a preliminary decree on in his suit and a final decree on All these events had taken place before There was nothing in the sale certificate to show that the due for which properties were sold were of anyone other than <NAME> individually The defendant respondent <NAME> and the defendant appellant <NAME> had both pleaded that the properties in suit were acquired by <NAME> with his own funds obtained by separate business in partnership with a stranger and that <NAME> plaintiff had no share in these properties <ORG> recorded a finding on which the learned Counsel for the appellant relies strongly There is overwhelming documentary and oral evidence to show that the sale deed Exhibit and the revenue sale are all true and supported by consideration and that the th Defendant would be entitled to them if these sales were not affected by the rule of Lis pendens within the meaning of Section of the Transfer of Property Act It may be mentioned here that the th Defendant is no other than the appellant <NAME> the son in law of defendant respondent <NAME> who had purchased the properties covered by both the impugned sales Learned Counsel for the plaintiff respondent has in reply drawn our attention to the following observations of <ORG> Ag the language of Section has been held to be applicable not only to private transfers but also to <ORG> sales held in execution of decrees does not make inapplicable to Ch which deals with mortgages The suggestion made on behalf of the appellant that attachment of some schedule property before judgment in the purchaser mortgage suit could remove it from the ambit of Lis pendens is quite unacceptable <ORG> had rightly distinguished cases cited on behalf of the appellant before it by holding that exemption from the scope of lis pendens cannot be extended to voluntary sales in any case Obviously its view was that even where a voluntary sale takes place in order to satisfy the decretal amount in a mort gage suit the result of such a sale was not the same as that of an involuntary sale in the course of execution proceedings where land is sold to satisfy the decree on the strength of a mortgage which creates an interest in the property mortgaged That was a case in which before the deposit of money by the preemptors in a suit to enforce their rights to pre emption the vendee had sold his rights to the appellant who had an equal right of pre emption It was held there that the claim for pre emption could be defeated by such a device which fell outside the purview of the principle of lis pendens We think that this decision turns upon its own facts and on the nature of the right of preemption which as was observed there is a weak right This Court had held that this weak right could be defeated by a sale which a vendee is compelled to make for the purpose of defeating the right provided the purchaser superior or equal right to pre emption had not been barred by limitation The observations made by this Court with regard to the doctrine of lis pendens when a plaintiff is enforcing a right of pre emption must we think be confined to cases of sales which could defeat preemptors claims It has to be remembered that a technical rule of the law of pre emption is that the preemptor to succeed in his suit must continue to possess the right to pre empt until the decree for possession is passed in his favour Subject to such rules as may be made under Section all loans granted under this Act all interest if any chargeable thereon and costs if any incurred in making the same shall when they become due be recoverable by the Collector in all or any of the following modes namely a from the borrower as if they were arrears of land revenue due by him from his surety if any as if they were arrears of land revenue due by him out of the land for the benefit of which the loan has been granted as if they were arrears of land revenue due in respect of that land out of the property comprised in the collateral security if any according to the procedure for the realization of land revenue by the sale of immovable property other than the land on which that revenue is due Provided that no proceeding in respect of any land under clause shall affect any interest in that land which existed before the date of the order granting the loan other than the interest of the borrower and of mortgages of or persons having charges on that interest and where the loan is granted under Section with the consent of another person the interest of that person and of mortgagees of or persons having charges on that interest In the case before us the borrower had himself taken up the case that the loan was taken by him individually for the purpose of purchasing a pumping set installed on the land Apart of the fact that there is no claim by the <ORG> before us we may observe that where a statutory provision is relied upon for recovery of dues the effect of it must be confined to what the statute enacts That this could be done was in our opinion implied in the direction that the properties sold should so far as possible be allotted to the share of <ORG> <NAME> ordinance on the subject said No decree bindeth any that commeth in bona fide by conveyance from the defendant before the bill exhibited and is made no party neither by bill nor the order but where he comes in pendente lite and while the suit is in full prosecution and without any colour of allowance or privity of the court there regularly the decree bindeth but if there were any intermissions of suit or the court made acquainted with the conveyance the court is to give order upon the special matter according to justice The doctrine however as would be evident from <NAME> work mentioned above is derived from the rules of jus gentium which became embodied in the Roman Law where we find the maxim Rem de qua controversia prohibemur in acrum dedicare a thing concerning which there is a controversy is prohibited during the suit from being alienated It is useful to remember this background of Section of our Transfer of Property Act which lays down During the pendency in any <ORG> of any suit or proceeding which is not collusive and in which any right to immovable property is directly and specifically in question the property cannot be transferred or otherwise dealt with by any party to the suit or proceeding so as to affect the rights of any other party thereto under any decree or order which may be made therein except under the authority of the <ORG> and on such terms as it may impose Again where all the parties which could be affected by a pending litigation are themselves parties to a transfer or dealings with property in such a way that they cannot resile from or disown the transaction impugned before the <ORG> dealing with the litigation the <ORG> may bind them to their own acts The purpose of Section of the Transfer of Property Act is not to defeat any just and equitable claim but only to subject them to the authority of the <ORG> which is dealing with the property to which claims are put forward For the reasons given above there is no force in this appeal which is dismissed with costs I have had the advantage of perusing the judgment prepared by my brother <NAME> but as I arrive at the same conclusion by a slightly different route I am writing a separate judgment I may give a few facts to make the judgment self sufficient was issued stating that <NAME> had purchased at public auction immoveable property described in the certificate for Rs It is common ground that these properties were included in the Schedule mentioned in the plaint It is stated in the judgment of <ORG> that <NAME> He filed a written statement inter alia alleging that the Plaint Schedule properties were the sole and absolute properties of the st defendant Additional issues were framed in the suit He executed the sham and nominal sale deed dated in favour of the th defendant to defeat the plaintiff rights and to secrete the properties There was no publication It protected the interest of the th defendant by stating that as far as possible the Commissioner to be appointed in the suit for division of the properties will allot to the plaintiff share such of the properties which are not covered by Exs The learned Judge who heard the appeal by his order dated September refused the leave on the ground that the leave was not asked for immediately on delivery of judgment and that it could not be asked for afterwards This <ORG> granted special leave At the outset Mr <NAME> raised the preliminary objection that the appeal was incompetent as Defendant No failed to ask for certificate orally and immediately after the judgment was delivered Clause of the Letters Patent inter alia provides for an appeal to <ORG> from a judgment of one judge made in exercise of the appellate jurisdiction in respect of a decree or order made in the exercise of appellate jurisdiction by a court subject to its superintendence where the Judge who passed the judgment declares that the case is a fit one for appeal Clause of the Letters Patent confers powers on the High <ORG> to make rules and orders for the purpose of regulating all proceedings in civil cases of the Letters Patent which is in similar terms as Clause mentioned above <ORG> of Judicature at Lahore had the power to make a rule prescribing the period of limitation in respect of appeals from Orders made by that <ORG> in exercise of its original jurisdiction to <ORG> of that <ORG> It seems to me that <ORG> can equally frame a rule regulating the time at which and the manner in which the application for a certificate shall be made It only regulates the manner of the exercise of that right It was said that the rule unduly restricts the right of the litigant to peruse the judgment and make up his mind whether to appeal or not But if the declaration is made immediately by the Judge that the case is fit one for appeal there is nothing to prevent the litigant from not filing the appeal if he considers it inadvisable to do so Leave was given by this Court after hearing the respondents on October No application was made at that stage to raise the point of incompetency of appeal Coming to the second point this Court has considered the scope of Section of the Transfer of Property Act and the rule of lis pendens in a number of cases There is no difficulty in holding that Ex since the result must bind the party to it so must it bind the person deriving his right title and interest from or through him But it is well established that the principle of lis pendens applies to such alienations If the principle of lis pendens applies to court auctions there is no reason why it should not apply to revenue sales The principle of lis pendens does not affect pre existing rights If there is a valid charge or mortgage on a property this does not vanish because the property becomes the subject matter of a partition suit The proviso to Section reads Provided that no proceeding in respect of any land under clause shall affect any interest in that land which existed before the date of the order granting the loan other than the interest of the borrower and of mortgagees of or persons having charges on that interest and where the loan is granted under Section with the consent of another persons the interest of that person and of mortgagees of or persons having charges on that interest Therefore if the <ORG> has sold only the property in respect of which loan was taken the purchaser defendant No is not prejudiced by the principle of lis pendens Therefore the direction of <ORG> was right insofar as it directed <ORG> to separate the properties for the improvement of which the loans under the Land Improvement Loans Act were taken from the other properties
