This appeal is directed against order dated passed by <ORG> of <ORG> whereby the writ petition filed by the appellants questioning the acquisition of their land for planned industrial development of District Gautam Budh Nagar through <ORG> hereinafter referred to as the <ORG> by invoking Section and of the Land Acquisition Act for short the Act as amended by Uttar Pradesh Act No of was dismissed Upon receipt of proposal from <ORG> for acquisition of hectares land of village Makora Pargana Dankaur Tehsil and District Gautam Budh Nagar which was approved by the State Government notification dated was issued under Section read with Section and of the Act The relevant portions of the notification are extracted below Under Sub Section of Section of the Land Acquisition Act Act no of the Governor is pleased to notify for general information that the land mentioned in the scheduled below is needed for public purpose namely planned industrial development in District Gautam Budh Nagar through <ORG> The Governor being of the opinion that the provisions of sub section of Section of the said Act are applicable to said land inasmuch as the said land is urgently required for the planned industrial development in District Gautam Budh Nagar through <ORG> and it is as well necessary to eliminate the delay likely to be caused by an enquiry under Section A of the said Act the Governor is further pleased to direct under sub section of Section of the said Act that the provisions of Section A of the said Act shall not apply Since the appellants land was also included in the notification they made a representation to the Chairman cum Chief Executive Officer of <ORG> Respondent No with copies to the Chief Minister Principal Secretary Housing and Urban Development the District Magistrate and the Special Officer Land Acquisition <NAME> with the request that their land comprised in Khasra No may not be acquired because they had raised construction years ago and were using the property for abadi habitation The concerned functionaries authorities did not pay heed to the request of the appellants and <ORG> issued notification dated under Section read with Section of the Act The appellants challenged the acquisition of their land on several grounds including the following i That the land cannot be used for industrial purposes because in the draft Master Plan of Greater NOIDA the same is shown as part of residential zone iii That the State Government arbitrarily invoked Section read with Section of the Act and deprived them of their valuable right to raise objections under Section A That as per the scheme of the said Act each and every section from sections to has an independent role to play though there is an element of interaction between them It is relevant to point out that the acquisition proceedings under the Act are based on the principal of eminent domain and the only protection given to the person whose land is sought to be acquired is an opportunity under Section A of the Act to convince the enquiring authority that the purpose for which the land is sought to be acquired is in fact is not a public purpose and is only purported to be one in the guise of a public purpose It is relevant to mention here that excluding the enquiry under Section A can only be an exception where the urgency cannot brook any delay The enquiry provides an opportunity to the owner of land to convince the authorities concerned that the land in question is not suitable for purpose for which it is sought to be acquired or the same sought to be acquired for the collateral purposes It is pertinent to mention here that the respondents No without the application of mind dispensed with the enquiry on the ground of urgency invoking the power conferred by Section or of the Act Further the respondent No without application of mind did not considered the survey report of the abadi of the village Makaura where the entire land is being used for the purpose of residence and grazing of cattle in Khasra No The report in respect of the land in question falling in Khasra No given by the respondent No vide communication dated th March is annexed as Annexure That the said notification under Section of the Act issued by the respondent No and is without application of mind and there was no urgency in the acquisition of land for the planned industrial development as the land as per the master plan the land of the village Makaura is reserved for residential of which the respondent No invoked Section and sub section of the Act by dispensing with an enquiry under Section A of the Act The such illegal act on the part of the respondents show mala fide and their oblique motive to deprive the owners from their houses in order to fulfill their political obligations promise to the private builders by taking the shelter of section of the Act by dispensing with the enquiry under Section A of the Act as well as overlooked purpose as stipulated in the Master Plan which is any way do not require any urgent attention That the purpose stated in the notification under Section and declaration under section by invoking section is presently non existent and thus the notification is bad in law There is no urgency for the invocation when the land is to be acquired for planned development for the purpose of setting residential colony The impugned notification is without any authority of law and volatile of Article A of the Constitution of India which limits the power to acquire land to the authority under the Land Acquisition Act Though in para of the writ petition an averment has been made that the respondents no and without the application of mind dispensed with the enquiry on the ground of urgency invoking the power conferred by Section or of the Act but in the affidavit the said paragraph has been sworn on the basis of perusal of record That the said notification under Section of the Act issued by the respondent No and is without application of mind and there was no urgency in the acquisition of land for the planned industrial development as the land as per the master plan the land of the village Makaura is reserved for residential of which the respondent No invoked Section and sub section of the Act by dispensing with an enquiry under Section A of the Act The such illegal act on the part of the respondents show mala fide and their oblique motive to deprive the owners from their houses in order to fulfill their political obligations promise to the private builders by taking the shelter of Section of the Act by dispensing with the enquiry under Section A of the Act as well as overlooked purpose as stipulated in the Master Plan which is any way do not require any urgent attention <ORG> also rejected the appellants plea that in terms of the policy framed by the State <ORG> the land covered by abadi cannot be acquired by observing that no material has been placed on record to show that the policy framed in was still continuing By an order dated this <ORG> after taking cognizance of the fact that the respondents did not get opportunity to file reply to the writ petition directed them to do so Thereupon <NAME> Additional District Magistrate Land Acquisition Officer on Special Duty Land Acquisition NOIDA District Gautam Budh Nagar filed counter affidavit on behalf of respondent Nos to In paragraph of his affidavit <NAME> has attempted to justify invoking of the urgency clause by making the following assertions That in invoking the urgency clause <ORG> has taken into consideration the following factors i <ORG> was constituted under the Industrial Area Development Act to promote Industrial and Urban Development in the Area iii That the acquired land was required for overall development i construction of roads laying of sewerages providing electricity etc If objections are to be invited and hearing be given to such large number of tenure holders it would take long time to dispose of the objections thereof and would hamper the planned development of the area <NAME> also controverted the appellants plea for exemption by stating that the constructions made by them on land of Khasra Nos and were insignificant and the construction raised on Khasra No is not part of village Abadi <NAME> Tehsildar filed a separate affidavit on behalf of Respondent No and justified the invoking of urgency clause by asserting that large tracts of land were acquired for industrial development of the district According to him as per the policy of industrial development of <ORG> the land is required to be allotted to industrial houses On <NAME> learned senior counsel for the <ORG> made a request for permission to file additional affidavit with some documents Thereafter the respondents filed an affidavit of <NAME> Tehsildar Land Acquisition <NAME> along with eight documents of which seven have been collectively marked as Annexure A The first of the documents marked Annexure A is copy of letter dated sent by the Commissioner and Director <ORG> to the Special Secretary <ORG> on the subject of issuance of notification under Sections and of the Act for acquisition of lands measuring hectares of village Makora The second document is an undated letter signed by Deputy Chief Executive Officer Greater Noida Collector <NAME> and four other officers officials The third document is communication dated sent by the Commissioner Meerut Division Meerut to the District Magistrate <NAME> conveying the consent of <ORG> for the acquisition of lands of five villages including Makora The last document which forms part of Annexure A is form No showing the list of properties having constructions etc Annexure A is copy of letter dated sent by the Director <ORG> to the Special Secretary <ORG> <NAME> learned counsel for the appellants argued that the impugned order is liable to be set aside because <ORG> failed to consider the issues raised in the writ petition in a correct perspective Learned counsel submitted that the appellants had specifically pleaded that there was no valid ground to invoke the urgency clause contained in Section and to dispense with the application of Section A but <ORG> did not even call upon the respondents to file counter affidavit and brushed aside the challenge to the acquisition proceeding on a wholly untenable premise that the affidavit filed in support of the writ petition was laconic Another argument of the learned counsel is that <ORG> misdirected itself in summarily dismissing the writ petition ignoring the substantive plea of discrimination raised by the appellants <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing for the respondents urged that this Court should not nullify the acquisition at the instance of the appellants because the pleadings filed before <ORG> were not supported by proper affidavit <NAME> argued that <ORG> was justified in non suiting the appellants because they did not produce any evidence to effectively challenge the invoking of urgency provision contained in Section He submitted that planned industrial development of District Gautam Budh Nagar is being undertaken in consonance with the policy decision taken by <ORG> and the appellants cannot be heard to make a grievance against the acquisition of their land because they will be duly compensated On the issue of discrimination <NAME> argued that even if the land belonging to some persons has been illegally left out from acquisition the appellants are not entitled to a direction that their land should also be released The first issue which needs to be addressed is whether <ORG> was justified in non suiting the appellants on the ground that they had not raised a specific plea supported by a proper affidavit to question the decision taken by <ORG> to invoke Section and of the Act We shall also consider an ancillary issue as to whether the appellants had succeeded in prima facie proving that there was no justification to invoke the urgency clause and to dispense with the inquiry envisaged under Section A At the outset we record our disapproval of the casual manner in which <ORG> disposed of the writ petition without even calling upon the respondents to file counter affidavit and produce the relevant records A reading of the averments contained in paragraphs and and grounds A and of the writ petition which have been extracted hereinabove coupled with the appellants assertion that the acquisition of their land was vitiated due to discrimination inasmuch as land belonging to influential persons had been left out from acquisition but their land was acquired in total disregard of the policy of <ORG> to leave out land on which dwelling units had already been constructed show that they had succeeded in making out a strong case for deeper examination of the issues raised in the writ petition and <ORG> committed serious error by summarily non suiting them The history of land acquisition legislations shows that in Eighteenth Century Bengal Regulation I of Act I of Act VI of Act XXII of Act of Bombay Act No XXVIII of Bombay Act No XVII of Madras Act No XX of and Madras Act No of were enacted to facilitate the acquisition of land and other immovable properties for roads canals and other public purposes by paying the amount to be determined by the arbitrators That Act envisaged that if the person having interest in land is not agreeable to part with possession by accepting the amount offered to him then the Collector may make a reference to <ORG> With a view to overcome this problem the legislature enacted the Act on the line of the English Lands Clauses Consolidation Act However the land owners or persons having interest in land did not have any say in the acquisition process either under pre legislations or the Act un amended They could raise objection only qua the amount of compensation and matters connected therewith The absence of opportunity to raise objection against the acquisition of land was resented by those who were deprived of their land The statement of Objects and Reasons contained in Bill No of which led to enactment of the amending Act read as under The Land Acquisition Act I of does not provide that persons having an interest in land which it is proposed to acquire shall have the right of objecting to such acquisition nor is Government bound to enquire into and consider any objections that may reach them The object of this Bill is to provide that a Local Government shall not declare under Section of the Act that any land is needed for a public purpose unless time has been allowed after the notification under Section for persons interested in the land to put in objections and for such objections to be considered by <ORG> Large tracts of land have been acquired in rural parts of the country in the name of development and transferred to private entrepreneurs who have utilized the same for construction of multi storied complexes commercial centers and for setting up industrial units Similarly large scale acquisitions have been made on behalf of the companies by invoking the provisions contained in Part VII of the Act Majority of them do not have any idea about their constitutional and legal rights which can be enforced by availing the constitutional remedies under Articles and of the Constitution Therefore while examining the land owner challenge to the acquisition of land in a petition filed under Article of the Constitution <ORG> should not adopt a pedantic approach as has been done in the present case and decide the matter keeping in view the constitutional goals of social and economic justice and the fact that even though the right to property is no longer a fundamental right the same continues to be an important constitutional right and in terms of Article A no person can be deprived of his property except by authority of law In cases where the acquisition is made by invoking Section read with Section and or <ORG> should insist upon filing of reply affidavit by the respondents and production of the relevant records and carefully scrutinize the same before pronouncing upon legality of the impugned notification action because a negative result without examining the relevant records to find out whether the competent authority had formed a bona fide opinion on the issue of invoking the urgency provision and excluding the application of Section A is likely to make the land owner a landless poor and force him to migrate to the nearby city only to live in a slum If the acquisition is intended to benefit private person and the provisions contained in Section and or are invoked then scrutiny of the justification put forward by the <ORG> should be more rigorous in cases involving the challenge to the acquisition of land the pleadings should be liberally construed and relief should not be denied to the petitioner by applying the technical rules of procedure embodied in the Code of Civil Procedure and other procedural laws The judiciary in its sphere shares the revolutionary purpose of the constitutional order and when called upon to decode social legislation must be animated by a goal oriented approach This is part of the dynamics of statutory interpretation in the developing countries so that courts are not converted into rescue shelters for those who seek to defeat agrarian justice by cute transactions of many manifestations now so familiar in the country and illustrated by the several cases under appeal This caveat has become necessary because the judiciary is not a mere umpire as some assume but an activist catalyst in the constitutional scheme We may now advert to the ancillary question whether <ORG> was justified in non suiting the appellants on the ground that they failed to discharge the primary burden of proving that <ORG> had invoked Section and without application of mind to the relevant considerations In this context it is apposite to observe that while dealing with challenge to the acquisition of land belonging to those who suffer from handicaps of poverty illiteracy and ignorance and do not have the resources to access the material relied upon by the functionaries of the <ORG> and its agencies for forming an opinion or recording a satisfaction that the urgency provisions contained in Section should be resorted to and or the enquiry envisaged under Section A should be dispensed with <ORG> should not literally apply the abstract rules of burden of proof enshrined in the Evidence Act The Court should also bear in mind that the relevant records are always in the exclusive possession domain of the authorities of the <ORG> and or its agencies Therefore an assertion by the appellants that there was no urgency in the acquisition of land that the concerned authorities did not apply mind to the relevant factors and records and arbitrarily invoked the urgency provisions and thereby denied him the minimum opportunity of hearing in terms of Section A and should be treated as sufficient for calling upon the respondents to file their response and produce the relevant records to justify the invoking of urgency provisions <ORG> held that the purpose of acquisition was a genuine public purpose but quashed the notifications by observing that the burden of proving the existence of circumstances which could justify invoking of urgency clause was on the <ORG> which it had failed to discharge When the formation of an opinion or the satisfaction of an authority is subjective but is a condition precedent to the exercise of a power the challenge to the formation of such opinion or to such satisfaction is limited in law to three points only It can be challenged firstly on the ground of mala fides secondly on the ground that the authority which formed that opinion or which arrived at such satisfaction did not apply its mind to the material on which it formed the opinion or arrived at the satisfaction and thirdly that the material on which it formed its opinion or reached the satisfaction was so insufficient that no man could reasonably reach that conclusion So far as the third point is concerned no court of law can as in an appeal consider that on the material placed before the authority the authority was justified in reaching its conclusion The court can interfere only in such cases where there was no material at all or the material was so insufficient that no man could have reasonably reached that conclusion In the case before us the petitioner has stated in the petition more than once that the urgency clause had been applied without any valid reason The urgency clause in respect of each of the said two notifications concerning the lands in Groups and is contained in the relative Section notification itself The public purpose stated in the notification is for development and utilization of the said lands as an industrial and residential area To start with this statement itself is vague in the sense that it is not clear whether the development and utilization of the lands referred to in that statement was confined to the lands mentioned in the schedule to the notification or it applied to a wider area of which such lands formed only a part The affidavit only states that the authority i the Commissioner of <ORG> was satisfied that the possession of the said lands was urgently required for the purpose of carrying out the said development Even Mr <NAME> conceded that the affidavit does not contain a statement of facts on which the authority was satisfied or on which it formed its opinion It is therefore quite clear that the respondents have failed to bring on record any material whatever on which the respondents formed the opinion mentioned in the two notifications The notifications themselves show that they concern many lands other than those falling in the said first and third groups It is not possible to know what was the development for which the lands were being acquired much less is it possible to know what were the circumstances which caused urgency in the taking of possession of such lands We have held that the burden of proving such circumstances at least prima facie is on the respondents As the respondents have brought no relevant material on the record the respondents have failed to discharge that burden emphasis supplied While dealing with the argument of the <ORG> that it was for the petitioner to prove that there was no material to justify invoking of the urgency clause this Court observed We do not think that a question relating to burden of proof is always free from difficulty or is quite so simple as it is sought to be made out here Indeed the apparent simplicity of a question relating to presumptions and burdens of proof which have to be always viewed together is often deceptive Over simplification of such questions leads to erroneous statements and misapplications of the law The Court then referred to the judgment in <NAME> Director Public Prosecutions AC extensively quoted from Phipson on Evidence th Edn noticed Sections to of the Evidence Act and observed Coming back to the cases before us we find that <ORG> had correctly stated the grounds on which even a subjective opinion as to the existence of the need to take action under Section of the Act can be challenged on certain limited grounds But as soon as we speak of a challenge we have to bear in mind the general burdens laid down by Sections and of the Evidence Act It is for the petitioner to substantiate the grounds of his challenge This means that the petitioner has to either lead evidence or show that some evidence has come from the side of the respondents to indicate that his challenge to a notification or order is made good If he does not succeed in discharging that duty his petition will fail But is that the position in the cases before us We find that although <ORG> had stated the question before it to be one which narrows down to the point as to the burden of proof yet it had analysed the evidence sufficiently before it to reach the conclusion that the urgency provision under Section had not been validly resorted to We think that the original or stable onus laid down by Section and Section of the Evidence Act cannot be shifted by the use of Section of the Evidence Act although the particular onus of providing facts and circumstances lying especially within the knowledge of the official who formed the opinion which resulted in the notification under Section of the Act rests upon that official Such an attitude may itself justify further judicial scrutiny On the other hand if in addition to the bare assertions made by the petitioners that the urgency contemplated by Section did not exist there were other facts and circumstances including the failure of the <ORG> to indicate facts and circumstances which it could have easily disclosed if they existed the petitioners could be held to have discharged their general onus It is also clear that even a technically correct recital in an order or notification stating that the conditions precedent to the exercise of a power have been fulfilled may not debar the court in a given case from considering the question whether in fact those conditions have been fulfilled And a fortiori the court may consider and decide whether the authority concerned has applied its mind to really relevant facts of a case with a view to determining that a condition precedent to the exercise of a power has been fulfilled If it appears upon an examination of the totality of facts in the case that the power conferred has been exercised for an extraneous or irrelevant purpose or that the mind has not been applied at all to the real object or purpose of a power so that the result is that the exercise of power could only serve some other or collateral object the court will interfere The <ORG> finally held as under There is no indication whatsoever in the affidavit filed on behalf of the <ORG> the mind of the Commissioner was applied at all to the question whether it was a case necessitating the elimination of the enquiry under Section A of the Act The recitals in the notifications on the other hand indicate that elimination of the enquiry under Section A of the Act was treated as an automatic consequence of the opinion formed on other matters The recital does not say at all that any opinion was formed on the need to dispense with the enquiry under Section A of the Act The burden therefore rested upon the <ORG> to remove the defect if possible by evidence to show that some exceptional circumstances which necessitated the elimination of an enquiry under Section A of the Act and that the mind of the Commissioner was applied to this essential question It seems to us that <ORG> correctly applied the provisions of Section of the Evidence Act to place the burden upon the <ORG> to prove those special circumstances although it also appears to us that <ORG> was quite correct in stating its view in such a manner as to make it appear that some part of the initial burden of the petitioners under Sections and of the Evidence Act had been displaced by the failure of the <ORG> to discharge its duty under Section of the Act The correct way of putting it would have been to say that the failure of the <ORG> to produce the evidence of facts especially within the knowledge of its officials which rested upon it under Section of the Evidence Act taken together with the attendant facts and circumstances including the contents of recitals had enabled the petitioners to discharge their burden under Sections and of the Evidence Act We shall now consider whether there was any valid ground or justification for invoking the urgency provision contained in Section and to exclude the application of Section A for the acquisition of land for planned industrial development of the district Sections A as amended and of the Act which have bearing on this question read as under Whenever it appears to the appropriate Government that land in any locality is needed or is likely to be needed for any public purpose or for a company a notification to that effect shall be published in <ORG> and in two daily newspapers circulating in that locality of which at least one shall be in the regional language and the Collector shall cause public notice of the substance of such notification to be given at convenient places in the said locality the last of the dates of such publication and the giving of such public notice being hereinafter referred to as the date of the publication of the notification Thereupon it shall be lawful for any officer either generally or specially authorized by such Government in this behalf and for his servants and workmen to enter upon and survey and take levels of any land in such locality to dig or bore into the sub soil to do all other acts necessary to ascertain whether the land is adapted for such purpose to set out the boundaries of the land proposed to be taken and the intended line of the work if any proposed to be made thereon to mark such levels boundaries and line by placing marks and cutting trenches and where otherwise the survey cannot be completed and the levels taken and the boundaries and line marked to cut down and clear away any part of any standing crop fence or jungle Provided that no person shall enter into any building or upon any enclosed court or garden attached to a dwelling house unless with

opportunity of being heard in person or by any person authorized by him in this behalf or by pleader and shall after hearing all such objections and after making such further inquiry if any as he thinks necessary either make a report in respect of the land which has been notified under section sub section or make different reports in respect of different parcels of such land to the appropriate <ORG> containing his recommendations on the objections together with the record of the proceedings held by him for the decision of that <ORG> Declaration that land is required for a public purpose Subject to the provisions of Part VII of this Act when the appropriate Government is satisfied after considering the report if any made under section A sub section that any particular land is needed for a public purpose or for a <ORG> a declaration shall be made to that effect under the signature of a Secretary to such Government or of some officer duly authorized to certify its orders and different declarations may be made from time to time in respect of different parcels of any land covered by the same notification under section sub section irrespective of whether one report or different reports has or have been made wherever required under section A sub section Provided that no declaration in respect of any particular land covered by a notification under section sub section i xx xx xx xx ii published after the commencement of the Land Acquisition Amendment Act shall be made after the expiry of one year from the date of the publication of the notification Provided further that no such declaration shall be made unless the compensation to be awarded for such property is to be paid by a Company or wholly or partly out of public revenues or some fund controlled or managed by a local authority In computing any of the periods referred to in the first proviso the period during which any action or proceeding to be taken in pursuance of the notification issued under section sub section is stayed by an order of a <ORG> shall be excluded Where the compensation to be awarded for such property is to be paid out of the funds of a corporation owned or controlled by the <ORG> such compensation shall be deemed to be compensation paid out of public revenues Every declaration shall be published in the Official Gazette and in two daily newspapers circulating in the locality in

shall state the district or other territorial division in which the land is situate the purpose for which it is needed its approximate area and where a plan shall have been made of the land the place where such plan may be inspected The said declaration shall be conclusive evidence that the land is needed for a public purpose or for a Company as the case may be and after making such declaration the appropriate Government may acquire the land in manner hereinafter appearing In cases of urgency whenever the appropriate <ORG> so directs the Collector though no such award has been made may on the expiration of fifteen days from the publication of the notice mentioned in section sub section take possession of any land needed for a public purpose Whenever owing to any sudden change in the channel of any navigable river or other unforeseen emergency it becomes necessary for any Railway Administration to acquire the immediate possession of any land for the maintenance of their traffic or for the purpose of making thereon a river side or ghat station or of providing convenient connection with or access to any such station or the appropriate <ORG> considers it necessary to acquire the immediate possession of any land for the purpose of maintaining any structure or system pertaining to irrigation water supply drainage road communication or electricity the Collector may immediately after the publication of the notice mentioned in sub section and with the previous sanction of the appropriate <ORG> enter upon and take possession of such land which shall thereupon vest absolutely in the <ORG> free from all encumbrances Provided that the Collector shall not take possession of any building or part of a building under this sub section without giving to the occupier thereof at least forty eight hours notice of his intention so to do or such longer notice as may be reasonably sufficient to enable such occupier to remove his movable property from such building without unnecessary inconvenience In every case under either of the preceding sub sections the Collector shall at that time of taking possession offer to the persons interested compensation for the standing crops and trees if any on such land and from any other damage sustained by them caused by such sudden dispossession and not excepted in section and in case such offer is not accepted the value of such crops and trees and the amount of such other damage shall be allowed for in awarding compensation for the land under the provisions herein contained A Before taking possession of any land under sub

notification under section sub section has been published in the Official Gazette on or after September but before January and the appropriate Government has under this sub section directed that the provisions of section A shall not apply a declaration under section in respect of the land may be made either simultaneously with or at any time after the publication in the Official Gazette of the notification under section sub section ANALYSIS OF THE PROVISIONS Section lays down that whenever it appears to the appropriate <ORG> that land in any locality is needed or is likely to be needed for any public purpose or for a company then a notification to that effect is required to be published in <ORG> and two daily newspapers having circulation in the locality A duty is also cast on the Collector as defined in Section to cause public notice of the substance of such notification to be given at convenient places in the locality Section lays down that after publication of the notification under Section any officer authorised by the <ORG> in this behalf his servants or workmen can enter upon and survey and take levels of any land in the locality or to dig or bore into the sub soil and to do all other acts necessary for ascertaining that land is suitable for the purpose of acquisition However neither the officer nor his servants or workmen can without the consent of the occupier enter into any building or upon any enclosed court or garden attached to a dwelling house without giving seven days notice to the occupier Section A which embodies the most important dimension of the rules of natural justice lays down that any person interested in any land notified under Section may within days of publication of the notification submit objection in writing against the proposed acquisition of land or of any land in the locality to the Collector The Collector is required to give the objector an opportunity of being heard either in person or by any person authorized by him or by pleader After hearing the objector and making such further inquiry as he may think necessary the Collector has to make a report in respect of land notified under Section with his recommendations on the objections and forward the same to the <ORG> along with the record of the proceedings held by him The Collector can make different reports in respect of different parcels of land proposed to be acquired Upon receipt of the Collector report the appropriate <ORG> is required to take action under Section which lays down that after considering the report if any made under Section A the appropriate <ORG> is satisfied that any particular land is needed for a public purpose then a declaration to that effect is required to be made under the signatures of a Secretary to the <ORG> or of some officer duly authorised to certify its orders This section also envisages making of different declarations from time to time in respect of different parcels of land covered by the same notification issued under Section In terms of clause ii of proviso to Section no declaration in respect of any particular land covered by a notification issued under Section which is published after can be made after expiry of one year from the date of publication of the notification To put it differently a declaration is required to be made under Section within one year from the date of publication of the notification under Section In terms of Section every declaration made under Section is required to be published in the official gazette and in two daily newspapers having circulation in the locality in which land proposed to be acquired is situated The Collector is also required to cause public notice of the substance of such declaration to be given at convenient places in the locality The declaration to be published under Section must contain the district or other territorial division in which land is situate the purpose for which it is needed its approximate area or a plan is made in respect of land and the place where such plan can be inspected Section lays down that the declaration made under Section shall be conclusive evidence of the fact that land is needed for a public purpose After publication of the declaration under Section the Collector is required to take order from the State <ORG> for the acquisition of land to be carved out and measured and planned Sections and Section envisages holding of an enquiry into the claim and passing of an award by the Collector who is required to take into consideration the provisions contained in Section Section lays down that after making an award the Collector can take possession of land which shall thereafter vest in the <ORG> If the appropriate <ORG> decides that land proposed to be acquired is urgently needed for a public purpose then it can authorise the competent authority to take possession Section lays down that in cases where appropriate <ORG> comes to the conclusion that there is existence of an urgency or unforeseen emergency it can direct that provisions of Section A shall not apply <NAME> says <NAME> where art thou hast thou not eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat <NAME> argued that even though the board had the legal authority to tear his house down no person should be deprived of their property without notice <NAME> stated Although there are not positive words in a statute requiring that the party shall be heard yet the justice of the common law shall supply the omission of the legislature But I do not think they are bound to treat such questions as though it were a trial they can obtain information in any way they think best always giving a fair opportunity to those who are parties in the controversy for correcting or contradicting any relevant statement prejudicial in their view In <NAME> <NAME> AC Lord <NAME> said that the right of a man to be given a fair opportunity of hearing what is alleged against him and of presenting his own case is so fundamental to any civilized legal system that it is to be presumed that <ORG> intended that failure to observe the same should render null and void any decision reached in breach of this requirement To use the phrase which better expresses the underlying concept what the requirements of fairness demand when any body domestic administrative or judicial has to make a decision which will affect the rights of individuals depends on the character of the decision making body the kind of decision it has to make and the statutory or other framework in which it operates In particular it is well established that when a statute has conferred on any body the power to make decisions affecting individuals the courts will not only require the procedure prescribed by the statute to be followed but will readily imply so much and no more to be introduced by way of additional procedural safeguards as will ensure the attainment of fairness This unwritten right of hearing is fundamental to a just decision by any authority which decides a controversial issue affecting the rights of the rival contestants This right has its roots in the notion of fair procedure It draws the attention of the party concerned to the imperative necessity of not overlooking the other side of the case before coming to its decision for nothing is more likely to conduce to just and right decision than the practice of giving hearing to the affected parties Indeed natural justice is a pervasive facet of secular law where a spiritual touch enlivens legislation administration and adjudication to make fairness a creed of life It has many colours and shades many forms and shapes and save where valid law excludes it applies when people are affected by acts of authority It is the hone of healthy government recognised from earliest times and not a mystic testament of Judge made law Indeed from the legendary days of <NAME> and of <NAME> <NAME> the rule of law has had this stamp of natural justice which makes it social justice We need not go into these deeps for the present except to indicate that the roots of natural justice and its foliage are noble and not new fangled Today its application must be sustained by current legislation case law or other extant principle not the hoary chords of legend and history Our jurisprudence has sanctioned its prevalence even like the Anglo American system Once we understand the soul of the rule as fair play in action and it is so we must hold that it extends to both the fields After all administrative power in a democratic set up is not allergic to fairness in action and discretionary executive justice cannot degenerate into unilateral injustice Nor is there ground to be frightened of delay inconvenience and expense if natural justice gains access The exceptions to the rules of natural justice are a misnomer or rather are but a shorthand form of expressing the idea that in those exclusionary cases nothing unfair can be inferred by not affording an opportunity to present or meet a case Text book excerpts and ratios from rulings can be heaped but they all converge to the same point that audi alteram partem is the justice of the law without of course making law lifeless absurd stultifying self defeating or plainly contrary to the common sense of the situation The audi alteram partem rule is intended to inject justice into the law and it cannot be applied to defeat the ends of justice or to make the law lifeless absurd stultifying self defeating or plainly contrary to the common sense of the situation Since the life of the law is not logic but experience and every legal proposition must in the ultimate analysis be tested on the touchstone of pragmatic realism <ORG> rule would by the experiential test be excluded if importing the right to be heard has the effect of paralysing the administrative process or the need for promptitude or the urgency of the situation so demands But at the same time it must be remembered that this is a rule of vital importance in the field of administrative law and it must not be jettisoned save in very exceptional circumstances where compulsive necessity so demands It is a wholesome rule designed to secure the rule of law and the court should not be too ready to eschew it in its application to a given case True it is that in questions of this kind a fanatical or doctrinaire approach should be avoided but that does not mean that merely because the traditional methodology of a formalised hearing may have the effect of stultifying the exercise of the statutory power <ORG> should be wholly excluded The court must make every effort to salvage this cardinal rule to the maximum extent permissible in a given case <ORG> is not cast in a rigid mould and judicial decisions establish that it may suffer situational modifications The core of it must however remain namely that the person affected must have a reasonable opportunity of being heard and the hearing must be a genuine hearing and not an empty public relations exercise After hearing all objections and making further inquiry he is to make a report to the appropriate <ORG> containing his recommendation on the objections The legislature has therefore made complete provisions for the persons interested to file objections against the proposed acquisition and for the disposal of their objections Save in real urgency where public interest does not brook even the minimum time needed to give a hearing land acquisition authorities should not having regard to Articles and burke an enquiry under Section of the Act Here a slumbering process pending for years and suddenly exciting itself into immediate forcible taking makes a travesty of emergency power These requirements obviously lead to the positive conclusion that the proceeding before the Collector is a blend of public and individual enquiry The person interested or known to be interested in the land is to be served personally of the notification giving him the opportunity of objecting to the acquisition and awakening him to such right That the objection is to be in writing is indicative of the fact that the enquiry into the objection is to focus his individual cause as well as public cause That at the time of the enquiry for which prior notice shall be essential the objector has the right to appear in person or through pleader and substantiate his objection by evidence and argument The acquisition of land under Section read with Section and or has generated substantial litigation in last years The learned Single Judge and <ORG> of <ORG> negatived the appellants challenge by observing that once Section is invoked there was no necessity to hold enquiry under Section A This Court set aside the order of <ORG> of <ORG> and held It will be seen that Section gives power to the Government to direct the Collector though no award has been made under Section to take possession of any waste or arable land needed for public purpose and such land thereupon vests absolutely in the Government free from all encumbrances If action is taken under Section taking possession and vesting which are provided in Section after the award under Section are accelerated and can take place fifteen days after the publication of the notice under Section Then comes Section which provides that in case of any land to which the provisions of sub section are applicable the Government may direct that the provisions of Section A shall not apply and if it does so direct a declaration may be made under Section in respect of the land at any time after the publication of the notification under Section It will be seen that it is not necessary even where the Government makes a direction under Section that it should also make a direction under Section If the Government makes a direction only under Section the procedure under Section A would still have to be followed before a notification under Section is issued though after that procedure has been followed and a notification under Section is issued the Collector gets the power to take possession of the land after the notice under Section without waiting for the award and on such taking possession the land shall vest absolutely in Government free from all encumbrances It is only when the Government also makes a declaration under Section that it becomes unnecessary to take action under Section A and make a report thereunder It may be that generally where an order is made under Section an order under Section is also passed but in law it is not necessary that this should be so It will also be seen that under the Land Acquisition Act an order under Section or Section can only be passed with respect to waste or arable land and it cannot be passed with respect to land which is not waste or arable and on which buildings stand <ORG> dismissed the writ petition filed by the appellant by observing that the Court cannot interfere with the subjective satisfaction reached by <ORG> on the issue of urgency The Court relied upon the judgments in King Emperor <NAME> Criminal Appeal No But even though the power of <ORG> has been formulated under Section of the Act in subjective terms the expression of opinion of <ORG> can be challenged as ultra vires in a court of law if it could be shown that <ORG> never applied it mind to the matter or that the action of <ORG> is mala fide If therefore in a case the land under acquisition is not actually waste or arable land but <ORG> has formed the opinion that the provisions of sub section of Section are applicable the court may legitimately draw an inference that <ORG> did not honestly form that opinion or that in forming that opinion <ORG> did not apply its mind to the relevant facts bearing on the question at issue It follows therefore that the notification of <ORG> under Section of the Act directing that the provisions of Section A shall not apply to the land is ultra vires Now the purpose of Section of the Act is obviously not merely to confine action under it to waste and arable land but also to situations in which an inquiry under Section A will serve no useful purpose or for some overriding reason it should be dispensed with The mind of the officer or authority concerned has to be applied to the question whether there is an urgency of such a nature that even the summary proceedings under Section A of the Act should be eliminated It is not just the existence of an urgency but the need to dispense with an inquiry under Section A which has to be considered This in itself on the face of it does not call for any such action barring exceptional circumstances as to make immediate possession without holding even a summary enquiry under Section A of the Act imperative On the other hand such schemes generally take sufficient period of time to enable at least summary inquiries under Section A of the Act to be completed without any impediment whatsoever to the execution of the scheme Therefore the very statement of the public purpose for which the land was to be acquired indicated the absence of such urgency on the apparent facts of the case as to require the elimination of an enquiry under Section A of the Act All schemes relating to development of industrial and residential areas must be urgent in the context of the country need for increased production and more residential accommodation Yet the very nature of such schemes of development does not appear to demand such emergent action as to eliminate summary enquiries under Section A of the Act In more lands were acquired from the same village by issuing notification under Section This time the land owners were given opportunity to file their objections and after considering the same <ORG> issued notification under Section for the acquisition of acres land In <ORG> submitted fresh proposal for the acquisition of land belonging to the appellants and others total land measuring acres The State Government issued notification under Section read with Section and of the Act clearly indicating therein that Section A was not applicable In any case whether the appellants lands have to be treated as immune from acquisition proceedings on the ground that they were having abadi thereon and were therefore governed by the policy decision of the State of not to acquire such lands Whether this Court should refuse to exercise its discretionary jurisdiction under Article of the Constitution of India in the facts and circumstances of the case While dealing with question No In the process the Court noted that in <ORG> had not resorted to Section and the acquisition proceedings were finalized after holding inquiry under Section A and observed We were informed by Senior Counsel <NAME> for <ORG> that even though in the earlier acquisition of pursuant to Section notification inquiry under Section A was not dispensed with by the time Section notification came to be issued Section was resorted to as urgency had developed at least by the end of December But curiously enough nothing happened urgently and Section notification which is impugned in the present case was issued on Thus despite the invocation of urgency by <ORG> by its letter dated it appears that the State did not think the said proposal to be so urgent as to immediately respond and to issue notification under Section read with Section sub section till More than one year elapsed in the meantime Why this delay took place and why the State did not think it fit to urgently respond to the proposal of <ORG> has remained a question mark for which there is no answer furnished by the respondent authorities in the present cases and nothing is brought on the record by them to explain the delay It has therefore necessarily to be presumed that despite the emergency powers of <ORG> being invoked by <ORG> the State authorities in their wisdom did not think the matter to be so urgent as to immediately respond and promptly issue Section notification read with Section Even that apart despite proposal to acquire this land was moved by <ORG> as early as on and even thereafter when the request was sent in this communication on the <ORG> authorities did not think the situation to be so urgent as to respond quickly and could wait for more than one year When the appellants in the writ petitions before <ORG> raised their grievances regarding dispensing with inquiry under Section A being not backed up by relevant evidence and the subjective satisfaction of the <ORG> in this connection was brought in challenge all that was stated by <ORG> in its counter in para was to the effect that the contents of paras and of the writ petition were denied and that the petitioners were not able to point out any lacunae in the proceedings under the Land Acquisition Act When we turn to paras and of the writ petition we find averments to the effect that the urgency of the acquisition was only for the purpose of depriving the petitioners of their rights to file objections under Section A and their right to hold the possession till they got compensation for which the respondents had issued notification under Section as well as notification Section of the Act But so far as the process of the acquisition was concerned the respondents were taking their own time which would be evident from the fact that the notification under Section read with Section was issued on but was published in the newspaper on whereas the declaration under Section of the Act was made on and that on the one hand the respondents had deprived the petitioners of filing their objections under Section A of the Act on the ground of urgency of acquisition but on the other hand they themselves had taken more than nine months in issuing the declaration under Section of the said Act This conduct of the respondents falsified their claim of urgency of acquisition When we turn to these annexures we find that AnnexureCA is a letter dated written by the District Magistrate Ghaziabad to the Joint Secretary <ORG> <ORG> It recites that on examination it was found that the land was immediately required in public interest so that the development work in the said land could be carried out smoothly What was the nature of urgency is not mentioned in the said letter When we turn to Annexure CA which is dated we find that the District Magistrate Ghaziabad wrote to the Joint Secretary <ORG> State of that as to how many farmers were going to be affected by the proposed acquisition It does not even whisper about the urgency of the situation which requires dispensing with Section A inquiry The last Annexure CA is the letter dated written by <ORG> to the Land Acquisition Officer proposing urgent acquisition of the lands in question We have already made a reference to the said letter It recites that if immediate action for acquisition of the aforesaid lands adjacent to Sector for development of which the acquisition was to be resorted to was not taken then there was possibility of encroachment over the area cannot by any stretch of imagination be considered to be a germane ground for invoking urgency powers for dispensing with Section A inquiry Even if acquisition takes place urgently by dispensing with inquiry under Section A and the possession is taken urgently after Section notification within days of issuance of notice under Section sub section even then there is no guarantee that the acquired land would not be encroached upon by unruly persons It is a law and order problem which has nothing to do with the acquisition and urgency for taking possession Even that apart it is easy to visualize that if objectors are heard in connection with Section A inquiry they would be the best person to protect their properties against encroachers We may now notice some recent decisions A careful perusal of this provision which is an exception to the normal mode of acquisition contemplated under the Act shows that mere existence of urgency or unforeseen emergency though is a condition precedent for invoking Section that by itself is not sufficient to direct the dispensation of the Section A inquiry It requires an opinion to be formed by the <ORG> concerned that along with the existence of such urgency or unforeseen emergency there is also a need for dispensing with Section A inquiry which indicates that the legislature intended the appropriate <ORG> to apply its mind before dispensing with Section A inquiry But then that is not the language of the section which in our opinion requires the appropriate <ORG> to further consider the need for dispensing with Section A inquiry in spite of the existence of unforeseen emergency An argument was sought to be advanced on behalf of the appellants that once the appropriate Government comes to the conclusion that there is an urgency or unforeseen emergency under Sections and the dispensation with inquiry under Section A becomes automatic and the same can be done by a composite order meaning thereby that there is no need for the appropriate Government to separately apply its mind for any further emergency for dispensation with an inquiry under Section A We are unable to agree with the above argument because sub section of Section itself indicates that the Government may direct that the rovisions of Section A shall not apply emphasis supplied which makes it clear that not in every case where the appropriate Government has come to the conclusion that there is urgency and under sub section or unforeseen emergency under sub section of Section the Government will ipso facto have to direct the dispensation of the inquiry Section confers extraordinary powers on the authorities under which it can dispense with the normal procedure laid down under Section A of the Act in exceptional case of urgency Such powers cannot be lightly resorted to except in case of real urgency enabling the <ORG> to take immediate possession of the land proposed to be acquired for public purpose A public purpose however laudable it may be by itself is not sufficient to take aid of Section to use this extraordinary power as use of such power deprives a landowner of his right in relation to immovable property to file objections for the proposed acquisition and it also dispenses with the inquiry under Section A of the Act The authority must have subjective satisfaction of the need for invoking urgency clause under Section keeping in mind the nature of the public purpose real urgency that the situation demands and the time factor i whether taking possession of the property can wait for a minimum period within which the objections could be received from the landowners and the inquiry under Section A of the Act could be completed Normally urgency to acquire a land for public purpose does not arise suddenly or overnight but sometimes such urgency may arise unexpectedly exceptionally or extraordinarily depending on situations such as due to earthquake flood or some specific time bound project where the delay is likely to render the purpose nugatory or infructuous A citizen property can be acquired in accordance with law but in the absence of real and genuine urgency it may not be appropriate to deprive an aggrieved party of a fair and just opportunity of putting forth its objections for due consideration of the acquiring authority While applying the urgency clause the <ORG> should indeed act with due care and responsibility Section no doubt deals with special situations and exceptional circumstances covering cases of urgency and unforeseen emergency In case of urgency falling under sub section of Section or of unforeseen emergency covered by sub section of Section special powers may be exercised by appropriate Government but as held by a three Judge Bench decision before more than four decades in <NAME> and reiterated by a three Judge Bench decision in <NAME> even in such cases inquiry and hearing of objections under Section A cannot ipso facto be dispensed with unless a notification under sub section of Section of the Act is issued The legislative scheme is amply clear which merely enables the appropriate Government to issue such notification under sub section of Section of the Act dispensing with inquiry under Section A if the Government intends to exercise the said power The use of the expression may in sub section of Section leaves no room of doubt that it is a discretionary power of the government to direct that the provisions of Section A would not apply to such cases covered by sub section or of Section of the Act In our opinion therefore the contention of learned counsel for the respondent authorities is not well founded and cannot be upheld that once a case is covered by sub section or of Section of the Act sub section of Section would necessarily apply and there is no question of holding inquiry or hearing objections under Section A of the Act Such observations had been made in reference to an observation made in the earlier decision in <NAME> case and keeping in mind the fact that right to property was no longer a fundamental right an observation was made that even if the right to property was no longer a fundamental right the observations relating to Article would continue to apply in full force with regard to Section A of the LA Act supra the two Judge Bench considered the question whether the State Government was justified in invoking Section for the acquisition of land for residential colony to be constructed by <ORG> Gorakhpur The Court noted that notifications under Section read with Section and were issued on November and February and declaration under Section was issued on December referred to judicial precedents including those noticed hereinabove and held The exceptional and extraordinary power of doing away with an enquiry under Section A in a case where possession of the land is required urgently or in an unforeseen emergency is provided in Section of the Act Such power is not a routine power and save circumstances warranting immediate possession it should not be lightly invoked The guideline is inbuilt in Section itself for exercise of the exceptional power in dispensing with enquiry under Section A The <ORG> obviously therefore has to apply its mind before it dispenses with enquiry under Section A on the aspect whether the urgency is of such a nature that justifies elimination of summary enquiry under Section A A repetition of the statutory phrase in the notification that <ORG> is satisfied that the land specified in the notification is urgently needed and the provision contained in Section A shall not apply though may initially raise a presumption in favour of the <ORG> that prerequisite conditions for exercise of such power have been satisfied but such presumption may be displaced by the circumstances themselves having no reasonable nexus with the purpose for which the power has been exercised Upon challenge being made to the use of power under Section the <ORG> must produce appropriate material before the <ORG> that the opinion for dispensing with the enquiry under Section A has been formed by the <ORG> after due application of mind on the material placed before it It is true that power conferred upon the <ORG> under Section is administrative and its opinion is entitled to due weight but in a case where the opinion is formed regarding the urgency based on considerations not germane to the purpose the judicial review of such administrative decision may become necessary As to in what circumstances the power of emergency can be invoked are specified in Section but circumstances necessitating invocation of urgency under Section are not stated in the provision itself Generally speaking the development of an area for residential purposes or a planned development of city takes many years if not decades and therefore there is no reason why summary enquiry as contemplated under Section A may not be held and objections of landowners persons interested may not be considered In many cases on general assumption likely delay in completion of enquiry under Section A is set up as a reason for invocation of extraordinary power in dispensing with the enquiry little realizing that an important and valuable right of the person interested in the land is being taken away and with some effort enquiry could always be completed expeditiously The special provision has been made in Section to eliminate enquiry under Section A in deserving and cases of real urgency The Government has to apply its mind on the aspect that urgency is of such nature that necessitates dispensation of enquiry under Section A We have already noticed a few decisions of this Court viz In <NAME> this Court held that the decision in <NAME> must be confined to the fact situation in those days when it was rendered and the two Judge Bench could not have laid down a proposition contrary to the decision in <NAME> The view of this <ORG> has differed on this aspect due to different fact situation prevailing in those cases In our opinion such delay will have material bearing on the question of invocation of urgency power particularly in a situation where no material has been placed by the appropriate <ORG> before the <ORG> justifying that urgency was of such nature that necessitated elimination of enquiry under Section A In Civil Appeal No decided on March the acquisition of land for construction of district jails was quashed on the ground that there was no valid ground or justification to exclude the application of Section A of the Act and it was observed Admittedly the Land Acquisition Act a pre Constitutional legislation of colonial vintage is a drastic law being expropriatory in nature as it confers on the <ORG> a power which affects person property right This Court is considering these questions especially in the context of some recent trends in land acquisition This Court is of the opinion that the concept of public purpose in land acquisition has to be viewed from an angle which is consistent with the concept of a welfare <ORG> The concept of public purpose cannot remain static for all time to come The said definition having suffered several amendments has assumed the character of an inclusive one It must be accepted that in construing public purpose a broad and overall view has to be taken and the focus must be on ensuring maximum benefit to the largest number of people Any attempt by the <ORG> to acquire land by promoting a pubic purpose to benefit a particular group of people or to serve any particular interest at the cost of the interest of a large section of people especially of the common people defeats the very concept of public purpose Even though the concept of public purpose was introduced by pre Constitutional legislation its application must be consistent with the constitutional ethos and especially the chapter under Fundamental Rights and also the Directive Principles In construing the concept of public purpose the mandate of Article of the Constitution that any pre constitutional law cannot in any way take away or abridge rights conferred under Part III must be kept in mind The meaning of public purpose in acquisition of land must be judged on the touchstone of this expanded view of Part III rights The open ended nature of our Constitution needs a harmonious reconciliation between various competing principles and the overhanging shadows of socio economic reality in this country Therefore the concept of public purpose on this broad horizon must also be read into the provisions of emergency power under Section with the consequential dispensation of right of hearing under Section A of the said Act The <ORG> must examine these questions very carefully when little Indians lose their small property in the name of mindless acquisition at the instance of the <ORG> To be fair to the respondents we may also notice the judgments in which the decision of the <ORG> to invoke Section and or has been upheld that in view of the time bound programme stipulated by the lender <ORG> the <ORG> had already appointed a large number of engineers and other subordinate staff for carrying out the said work and that holding an inquiry under Section A would have resulted in uncalled for delay endangering the entire scheme and time schedule of <ORG> If must be remembered that the satisfaction under Section is a subjective one and that so long as there is material upon which the <ORG> could have formed the said satisfaction fairly the <ORG> would not interfere nor would it examine the material as an appellate authority This is the principle affirmed by decisions of this <ORG> not under Section but also generally with respect to subjective satisfaction supra <ORG> upheld the acquisition of land under Sections A and by observing that the problem of providing houses to the dalits tribes and poor needed emergency measures and so long as the problem is not solved and the need of that segment of the society is not fulfilled the urgency continues to subsist The premises which were under occupation of the students of <ORG> Calcutta were obviously badly needed for the College and the appropriate authority having failed in their attempt earlier twice the orders having been quashed by <ORG> had taken the third attempt of issuing notification under Sections and of the Act such acquisition cannot be held to be mala fide and therefore the conclusion of <ORG> in the impugned judgment that the acquisition is mala fide must be set aside and we accordingly set aside the same of and of by which amendments were made in Section of the Act The Bench referred to some of the precedents on the subject and refused to quash the acquisition by observing that the acquired land has already been utilized for construction of houses by third parties We are completely convinced that there was necessity in this <ORG> considering the various reasons like enormousness of the <ORG> likelihood of the encroachments number of appellants who would have required to be heard and the time taken for that purpose and the fact that the <ORG> had lingered already from till We do not see any reason why we should take a different view than what is taken by the <ORG> What is important to be noted is that in none of the aforementioned judgments the <ORG> was called upon to examine the legality and or justification of the exercise of power under Section and or for the acquisition of land for residential commercial or industrial purpose supra the invoking of urgency provision contained in Section and exclusion of Section A was approved by the <ORG> keeping in view the acute problem of housing which was perceived as a national problem and for the solution of which national housing policy was framed and the imperative of providing cheaper shelter to dalits tribals and other disadvantaged sections of the society supra the acquisition was upheld because the land was urgently needed for construction of Yamuna Expressway and by the time the matter was decided by this <ORG> huge amount had been spent on the project From the analysis of the relevant statutory provisions and interpretation thereof by this <ORG> in different cases the following principles can be culled out i Eminent domain is a right inherent in every sovereign to take and appropriate property belonging to citizens for public use To put it differently the sovereign is entitled to reassert its dominion over any portion of the soil of the <ORG> including private property without its owner consent provided that such assertion is on account of public exigency and for public good iii Though in exercise of the power of eminent domain the Government can acquire the private property for public purpose it must be remembered that compulsory taking of one property is a serious matter A public purpose however laudable it may be does not entitle the <ORG> to invoke the urgency provisions because the same have the effect of depriving the owner of his right to property without being heard Section read with Section confers extraordinary power upon the <ORG> to acquire private property without complying with the mandate of Section A Therefore before excluding the application of Section A the concerned authority must be fully satisfied that time of few weeks or months likely to be taken in conducting inquiry under Section A will in all probability frustrate the public purpose for which land is proposed to be acquired vi The satisfaction of the Government on the issue of urgency is subjective but is a condition precedent to the exercise of power under Section and the same can be challenged on the ground that the purpose for which the private property is sought to be acquired is not a public purpose at all or that the exercise of power is vitiated due to mala fides or that the concerned authorities did not apply mind to the relevant factors and the records vii The exercise of power by the Government under Section does not necessarily result in exclusion of Section A of the Act in terms of which any person interested in land can file objection and is entitled to be heard in support of his objection The use of word may in sub section of Section makes it clear that it merely enables the Government to direct that the provisions of Section A would not apply to the cases covered under sub section or of Section The <ORG> can take judicial notice of the fact that planning execution and implementation of the schemes relating to development of residential commercial industrial or institutional areas usually take few years Therefore the private property cannot be acquired for such purpose by invoking the urgency provision contained in Section The stage is now set for consideration of the issue whether <ORG> was justified in invoking the urgency provision contained in Section and excluding the application of Section A for the acquisition of land for planned industrial development of District <NAME> A recapitulation of the facts shows that upon receipt of proposal from <ORG> <ORG> issued directions to the concerned authorities to take action for the acquisition of land in different villages including village Makora If there is any delay in the acquisition of land then the same is likely to be encroached and that will adversely affect the concept of planned industrial development of the district If land is not made available to the incoming leading and reputed industrial concerns of the country then they will definitely establish their units in other States and if this happens then it will adversely affect employment opportunities in the State and will also go against the investment policy of the Government If written oral objections are invited from the farmers and are scrutinized then it will take unprecedented long time and disposal thereof will hamper planned development of the area It is neither the pleaded case of the respondents nor any evidence has been produced before the Court to show that <ORG> and or agencies instrumentalities of the <ORG> are intending to establish industrial units on the acquired land either by itself or through its agencies instrumentalities The respondents have justified the invoking of urgency provisions by making assertions which are usually made in such cases by the executive authorities i the inflow of funds in the <ORG> in the form of investment by private entrepreneurs and availability of larger employment opportunities to the people of the area However we do not find any plausible reason to accept this tailor made justification for approving the impugned action which has resulted in depriving the appellants of their constitutional right to property Even if planned industrial development of the district is treated as public purpose within the meaning of Section there was no urgency which could justify the exercise of power by <ORG> under Section and Therefore time required for ensuring compliance of the provisions contained in Section A cannot by any stretch of imagination be portrayed as delay which will frustrate the purpose of acquisition Of course in terms of sub section the Collector is required to give opportunity of hearing to the objector and submit report to the <ORG> after making such further inquiry as he thinks necessary This procedure is likely to consume some time but as has been well said Principles of natural justice are to some minds burdensome but this price a small price indeed has to be paid if we desire a society governed by the rule of law The authorities up to the level of the Commissioner completed the exercise of survey and preparation of documents by the end of December but it took one year and almost three months to <ORG> to issue notification under Section read with Section and If this much time was consumed between the receipt of proposal for the acquisition of land and issue of notification it is not possible to accept the argument that four to five weeks within which the objections could be filed under sub section of Section A and the time spent by the Collector in making inquiry under sub section of Section A would have defeated the object of acquisition The time limit of one year specified in clause ii of the proviso to Section is the outer limit for issue of declaration The only possible conclusion which can be drawn from the above discussion is that there was no real and substantive urgency which could justify invoking of the urgency provision under Section and in any case there was no warrant to exclude the application of Section A which as mentioned above represent the statutory embodiment of the rule of <ORG> We also find merit in the appellants plea that the acquisition of their land is vitiated due to violation of the doctrine of equality enshrined in Article of the Constitution Why their land was not left out from acquisition has not been explained in the counter affidavit filed by the respondents <ORG> should have treated this as sufficient for recording a finding that the respondents had adopted the policy of pick and choose in acquiring some parcels of land and this amounted to violation of Article of the Constitution It is quite possible that others may have due to sheer poverty ignorance and similar handicaps not been able to avail legal remedies for protection of their rights but that cannot be made basis to deny what is due to the appellants The impugned order is set aside and the writ petition filed by the appellants is allowed It is however made clear that the respondents shall be free to proceed from the stage of Section notification and take appropriate action after complying with Section A and of the Act
