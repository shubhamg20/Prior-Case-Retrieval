These are two appeals for which the appellant Mrs <NAME> obtained special leave from His Majesty in Council against two decisions of <ORG> at Madras They arise in the following circumstances There are in India two legislative Acts of the Governor General of India in Council relating to printing one being The Printing Presses and Newspapers Act No XXV of Under the second Act Section Sub section the person making the declaration is required to deposit before a Magistrate in money or in certain securities a sum not being leas than Rs But the Magistrate may for special reasons which ho is to record dispense with the deposit and he has certain powers of canceling or varying any order made under this sub section By Section of the Act the local Government when it appears to it that any printing press in respect of which any security has been deposited is used for the purpose of printing any newspaper which contains words signs or visible representations of a nature deemed to be objectionable under the detailed provisions of the section which will be hereinafter specifically set forth may by notice in writing addressed to the keeper of the press declare the security and all copies of the newspaper wherever found forfeited to His Majesty and after the expiry of ten days from the date of the issue of the notice of forfeiture the declaration required of every keeper of a press is to be deemed to be annulled By Section Any person having an interest in any property in respect of which an order of forfeiture has been made under Section or under certain other sections not material to the present Appeal may within two months from the date of such order apply to <ORG> to set aside such order on the ground that the newspaper in respect of which the order was made did not contain any words signs or visible representations of the nature described in Section Sub section On the nd December the appellant being the owner and keeper of a printing press and printer and publisher of a newspaper called at that time and thereafter New India made the declaration required of her under the Act of and the Magistrate before whom it was made using the power of dispensation given to him by Section of the Act of thought fit to dispense with the deposit of the security which under the provisions of the same section she would otherwise have had to give The document in which the dispensation was embodied is not contained in the record of these appeals and their Lordships have not before them the reasons which the Magistrate recorded as the grounds for granting this dispensation On the th May the appellant received a notice from the Magistrate dated the nd May in which it was stated that he under Sub section of Section cancelled the order dispensing with the security and required her within fourteen days to deposit Rs On the th August she was served with an order dated the th August and made by the Governor in Council reciting that twenty passages published in the newspaper and identified in the order were of the nature described in Sub section of Section of the Act of and declaring that the security which the appellant had deposited and all copies of New India wherever found were to be forfeited to the <ORG> The appellant thereupon purporting to avail herself of the provisions of Section of the Act presented her petition to a Special Bench of <ORG> at Madras praying that both the order of the Magistrate requiring security and the order of the Governor in Council should be revised and set aside The petitioner thereupon applied to <ORG> for leave to appeal in both cases and on this leave being refused by <ORG> applied to His Majesty in Council for special leave to appeal and this leave having been given as already stated in respect of both orders both matters are now before their Lordships It will be convenient to consider first the application to quash the order of the Magistrate This question divides itself into two parts was the procedure adopted a competent and suitable method of reviewing the order and if it be open to review is it to be deemed an illegal and unwarranted order The Statute contemplates that in ordinary cases security shall be deposited and the only duty of the Magistrate is to fix the amount having regard to the two limits and to receive it It was contended before their Lordships that to read this proviso as enabling the Magistrate to cancel or vary an order of dispensation would be to make a proviso upon a proviso and to collect a positive enactment out of that which was only a qualifying provision But it is well settled that there is no magic in words of proviso and that the plain meaning must be given to the words of the legislature and those words enable the Magistrate to cancel or vary any order made under the sub section which should mean among other orders of dispensation If the Magistrate having fixed the minimum security may vary his order by imposing the maximum there is no reason why he should not as time goes on think fit to require security when at first he thought fit to require none Under the second sub section a power of requiring a deposit where none up to that moment had been required is given in certain cases to the local Government and it is natural to suppose that what the local Government may do in a proper case under Sub Section may be done in a proper case by the Magistrate under Sub section There must be a deposit unless there is a positive order of dispensation the canceling of an order fixing the deposit at say Rs would leave the keeper of the printing press in the position of having to apply to the Magistrate to make some further order either fixing a new sum or dispensing with any and till such new order had been made and complied with the Keeping of the printing press would apparently be an unlawful act so that the cancellation of the order fixing the deposit at Rs But if the Magistrate had originally thought fit to dispense with security and afterwards changed his mind the right phrase to use would be that he had cancelled his order of dispensation Their Lordships are therefore of opinion that the Magistrate has power under the section to cancel an order of dispensation the necessary consequence of which will be that security will have to be deposited according to the amount thereupon fixed by him within the limits prescribed as would be done in normal course on the first making of a declaration It is next contended on behalf of the appellant that the act of the Magistrate in canceling the dispensation was a judicial order and was bad because she was given no opportunity of being heard before an adverse order was made against her To this argument several answers have been given that the order might be treated as an ex parte order which it would have been open to her to move to discharge instead of complying with it as she did under protest that as a judicial order it was still one made by the Magistrate within the exercise of his jurisdiction and that the omission to hear her was only an irregularity which could not be reviewed or at any rate could not be reviewed by process of certiorari and lastly that the act was not a judicial act but one done in the exercise of administrative functions Those to whom power was entrusted by the Act of were any person exercising the full powers of a Magistrate and were to include Magistrates of Police and Justices of the Peace It was argued before their Lordships that the change in the second Act that is in especial the substitution of the Chief Presidency Magistrate for territory within his jurisdiction showed an intention on the part of the <ORG> to make the action of the Magistrate judicial and not administrative It is only in one case that he is to record his reasons and that is when there is a departure from the normal and the object of recording them is as the Officiating Chief Justice rightly said for the information of his superiors in the <ORG> It would have been in their Lordships opinion more discreet and it would have removed an occasion for comment and complaint if the Magistrate had given the appellant some opportunity for making her observations before the privilege was withdrawn it might have been a wiser discharge of his duty as an officer It results therefore that if the order of the Magistrate was open to examination either upon process of certiorari or by a way of revision the consequence of an examination would be to leave the order as it stands and this consequence is not without its bearing upon the question which is prior in order of reasoning whether it was competent to the <ORG> to enter upon any such examination It is not easy to gee how these proceedings could be deemed criminal proceedings within the Code of Criminal Procedure They are not proceedings against the appellant as charged with an offence They are at the utmost proceedings which rendered the appellant if she should thereafter commit a criminal or forbidden act open to a particular form of procedure for a penalty As to certiorari it was contended on behalf of the respondent in <ORG> that there is no power in <ORG> to issue a writ of certiorari or alternatively that the provisions of Section forbid recourse to this writ in cases which come under the Press Act As to the first point it would seem that at any rate the there <ORG> of Calcutta Madras and Bombay possessed the power of issuing this writ Section re the Justices of the Supreme Court of Judicature at Bombay Knapp Supposing that this power once existed has it been taken away by the two codes of procedure No doubt these codes provide for most cases a much more convenient remedy For such cases their Lordships do not think that the powers of the High Courts which have inherited the ordinary or extraordinary jurisdiction of <ORG> to issue writs of certiorari can be said to have been taken away But assuming that the power to issue the writ remains and that it might be exercised notwithstanding the existence of procedure by way of revision Section has still to be considered shall as against all persons be conclusive evidence that the forfeiture therein referred to has taken place and no proceeding purporting to be taken order this Act shall be called in question by any Court except <ORG> on such application as aforesaid and no civil or criminal proceeding except as provided by this Act shall be instituted against any person for anything done or in good faith intended to be done under this Act As to this section it was contended on behalf of the appellant that as the writ of certiorari was not in terms said to be taken away the right to it remained notwithstanding the very express but still general words of this section However that might be according to English Law where there is no such revision procedure as in India their Lordships see no reason for narrowing the express words of the Indian Act If the order of the Magistrate were a judicial order it would have been made in the exercise either of his civil or of his criminal jurisdiction and procedure by way of revision would have been open Even were it to be said that the order was of that quasi judicial kind to which certiorari has sometimes been applied in England or in India the Press Act may quite reasonably have intended to take it away and there is no reason why full effect should not be given to its language The order of <ORG> dismissing this application was therefore right and the appeal from it must be dismissed The power of the local Government to make a forfeiture under Section no doubt depends upon there being a deposit to forfeit But at the time the order was made th August there had been in fact a deposit since th June and the appellant had taken no steps to get herself relieved from the order made on the nd May directing the deposit or to get it back Even were it contended that the deposit ought to be regarded as having been so unwarrantably exacted that it ought to count as non existent there was nothing to show that the local Government was or ought to have been aware of this Lastly the appellant made no application by way of certiorari or otherwise to quash the declaration of forfeiture and the only way in which it was attacked was by using the procedure under Section which as pointed out in <ORG> is available only for one purpose that is of showing on the merits that the published articles were not deserving of forfeiture Their Lordships have now to deal with the other appeal Section Sub section of the Indian Press Act is in so far as it is material in the following terms Whenever it appears to <ORG> that any printing press in respect of which any security has been deposited as required by Section is used for the purpose of printing or publishing any newspaper book or other document containing any words signs or visible representations which are likely or may have a tendency directly or indirectly whether by inference suggestion allusion metaphor implication or otherwise to bring into hatred or contempt His Majesty or the Government established by law in British India or the administration of justice in British India or any Native Prince or Chief under the suzerainty of His Majesty or any class or section of His Majesty subjects in British India or to excite disaffection towards His Majesty or the said Government or any such Prince or Chief or to encourage or incite any person to interfere with the administration of the law or with the maintenance of law and order <ORG> may by notice in writing to the keeper of such printing press stating or describing the words signs or visible representations which in its opinion are of the nature described above declare the security deposited in respect of such press and all copies of such newspaper book or other document wherever found to be forfeited to His Majesty EXPLANATION IIn Clause the expression disaffection includes disloyalty and all feeling of enmity Comments expressing disapproval of the measures of the <ORG> or of any such Native Prince or Chief as aforesaid with a view to obtain their alteration by lawful means or of the administrative or other action of the <ORG> or of any such Native Prince or Chief or of the administration of justice in British India without exciting or attempting to excite hatred contempt or disaffection do not come within the scope of Clause Thereupon the appellant availed herself of the remedy given to her by Sections and and applied to a Special Bench of <ORG> to set aside the order on the ground that the newspaper did not contain any words signs or visible representations of the nature described in Section Sub Section In accordance with these conclusions the <ORG> dismissed the application made by the appellant The language is not precisely the same but there is the same delicate balancing of two important public considerations the undesirability of anything tending to excite sedition or to excite strife between classes and the undesirability of preventing any bona fide argument for reform in which case this <ORG> refused leave to appeal In substance the question under Clause of Section Sub section comes to this are the passages such as in fact to excite or do they disclose an attempt which implies intention to excite hatred contempt or disaffection towards the <ORG> or of any class or section of His Majesty subjects in India and in judging the question of intent the publisher must be deemed to intend that which is the natural result of the words used having regard among other things to the character and description of that part of the public who are to be expected to read the articles It may be assumed for the purposes of this case that there may be reference to a class or section of His Majesty subjects so couched as to show that the attack is merely upon a school of opinion and that unless the language is such as to excite hatred or contempt of persons it may escape condemnation But assuming this the appellant remains face to face with the difficulty that there is language used in certain of the articles which may legitimately be construed as tending by inference or suggestion to excite hatred or contempt in such a fashion that it may become personal And it must be remembered that those words in Clause which refer to the hatred or contempt of a class or section are not limited by explanation and that there has been in this respect some departure from the policy of the Penal Code which superadded a qualifying explanation which has not found place in the Press Act As to Clause the majority of the Judges in <ORG> were brought to the conclusion that the attacks on Anglo India or Anglo Indians or the bureaucracy as the case may be were calculated whatever might have been the primary object of the writer to bring into hatred or contempt persons forming a class or section of His Majesty subjects namely English Civil Servants in India in some cases Englishmen in India generally There were also as already stated findings by <NAME> and <NAME> bringing some of the articles under Clause a clause which it should be noted is not qualified by any explanation Upon careful perusal of the several judgments their Lordships find that weight has been properly given to the several portions of the section There remains only the question of application in detail of the principles of the Law to the language of the various articles When their Lordships have progressed so far the question becomes one which partakes so much of the nature of a question of fact that it would be difficult for their Lordships even if they were inclined to construe the natural tendency of the words differently to interfere with the conclusions arrived at by the <ORG> in India For <ORG> when it sits to advise His Majesty in the exercise of his prerogative in criminal cases does so under constitutional limitations which as has often been explained and notably in the case of <NAME> <NAME> and in <NAME> case already quoted preclude it from exercising the full functions of a <ORG> of Criminal Appeal Their Lordships will therefore humbly recommend His Majesty that both these appeals should be dismissed with costs
