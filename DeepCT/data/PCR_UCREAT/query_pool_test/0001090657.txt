against a person accused of an offence RAGHUBAR DAYAL This appeal by special <ORG> leave raises the question whether a <ORG> Officer either under the Land <ORG> Act Act XIX of or under the Sea <ORG> Act Act VIII of is a In consequence of information received with respect to the smuggling of gold by the engine crew the <ORG> staff boarded the engine at Atari and other staff of the <ORG> surrounded the engine on its arrival at Amritsar to the effect the letter is the same which <NAME> had given to me yesterday On June <NAME> the respondent made certain other statements Ex A second statement was made to the same <ORG> Inspector on June Ex On this occasion too he made a similar statement adding that he was to get Rs The conviction was confirmed by the appellate Court but was set aside on revision by <ORG> which held that <ORG> Officers were police officers within the meaning of that expression in of the Evidence Act that confessional statements made to them were consequently inadmissible in evidence and that if they be excluded from consideration there was no other evidence to sustain the conviction It further held that of the Evidence Act did not apply to the facts of the case as the recovery of gold was the result of search made by the <ORG> Officers and not the result of inter rogating the respondent The State of Punjab has filed this appeal against the acquittal order The only contention raised for the appellant in the appeal is that the <ORG> Officers to whom the confessional statements were made were not police officers within the meaning of that expression in of the Evidence Act It was contended that the mere fact that powers to arrest certain persons to make searches and to record evidence having a bearing on the alleged contravention of the legal provisions are conferred on certain officers of the <ORG> Department is not sufficient to make them police officers contemplated by of the Evidence Act even if it be assumed correct We may mention at this stage that the Officers to whom the respondent made confessional statements were Land Customs Officers appointed under the Land Customs Act purpose of the levy of duties of land customs under this Act in like manner as they apply for the purpose of the levy of duties of customs on goods imported or exported by sea Among the sections of the Sea Customs Act made applicable by sub of of the Land Customs Act are included all the sections in Chapters XVI and XVIT of the Sea Customs Act viz Police whatever meaning be given to that word the preamble of the Act further says whereas it is expedient to reorganise the police and to make it a more efficient instrument for the prevention and detection of crime it is enacted as follows The authority given to police officers must naturally be to enable them to discharge their duties efficiently It is clear therefore in view of the nature of the duties imposed on the police officers the nature of the authority conferred and the purpose of the police Act that the powers which the police officers enjoy are powers for the effective prevention and detection of crime in order to maintain law and order the smuggling of goods and the due realisation of customs duties and to determine the action to be taken in the interests of the revenues of the country by way of confiscation of goods on which no duty had been paid and by imposing penalties and fines Reference to of the Land <ORG> Act may be usefully made at this stage prescribed thereunder apply for the purpose of levy of duties of and customs under the Land <ORG> Act in like manner as the apply for the purpose of levy of duties of customs on goods imported or exported by sea This makes it clear that the provisions conferring various powers on the Sea <ORG> Officers are for the purpose of levying and realization of duties of customs on goods and that those powers are conferred on the <ORG> customs officers also for the same purpose Apart from such an expression in of the Land <ORG> Act there are good reasons in support of the view that the powers conferred on the <ORG> Officers are different in character from those of the police officers for the detection and prevention of crime and that the powers conferred on them are merely for the purpose of ensuring that dutiable goods do not enter the country without payment of duty and that articles whose entry is prohibited are not brought in It is with respect to the detecting and preventing of the smuggling of goods and preventing loss to the Central Revenues that <ORG> Officers have been given the power to search the property and person and to detain them and to summon persons to give evidence in an enquiry with respect to the smuggling of goods The preamble of the Sea <ORG> Act says Whereas it is expedient to consolidate and amend the law relating to the levy of Sea <ORG> duties The <ORG> Officers are given the power to confiscate to fix the duty and to impose penalties which can in certain cases be of enormous amounts They have nothing to investigate about it Similarly the offence at item relates to a person making a false declaration Item creates an offence with respect to a person doing certain things to defraud the <ORG> The <ORG> Officer therefore is not primarily concerned with the detection and punishment of crime committed by a person but is mainly interested in the detection and prevention of smuggling of goods and safeguarding the recovery of customs duties It was said at It is clear on a perusal of the above pro visions that the powers of search arrest and detention are given to the Customs Authorities for the levy of sea customs duties an provision is made at the same time for a reference to the Magistrate in all cases where In <NAME> The estate of Punjab it was There are as many as entriesin the Schedule to besides those added later but each one of those or more entries though an Offence being an act infringing certain provisions of the sections and rules under the Act is not a criminal offence They i <ORG> Officers have been only given limited powers of search Similarly they have been given limited powers to summon persons to give evidence or to produce documents Further it was observed at It is true that the petitioners were dealt with by the Collector of <ORG> for the offence of smuggling were found guilty and a deterrent punish ment was imposed upon them but as he had not been vested with the powers of a Magistrate or a criminal court his proceedings against the petitioners were in the nature of <ORG> proceedings with a view to detecting the infringement of the provisions of the Sea Customs Act and imposing penalties when it was found that they had been guilty of those infringements Those penalties the Collector had been empowered to impose in order not only to prevent a recurrence of such infringements but also to recoup the loss of such revenue resulting from such infringements A person is a member of the police force when he holds his office under any of the Acts dealing with the police Sections and of the Police Act provide for the appointment of special police officers who are not enrolled under the Act but are appointed for special occasions and have the same Powers privileges and protection and are liable to perform the same duties as the ordinary officer of the police There has however arisen a divergence of opinion about officers on whom some powers analogous to those of police officers have been conferred being police officers for the purpose of of the Evidence Act The view which favours their being held police officers is based on their possessing powers which are usually possessed by the police and on the supposed intention of the legislature at the time of the enactment of of the Evidence Act to be that the expression police officer should include every one who is engaged in the work of detecting and preventing crime The other view is based on the plain meaning of the expression and on the consideration that the mere fact that an officer who by no stretch of imagination is a police officer does not become one merely because certain powers similar to the powers of a police officer are conferred on him We now refer to certain aspects which lead us to consider that the expression police officer has not such a wide meaning as to include persons on whom certain police powers are conferred The object of enacting of the Evidence Act whose provisions formerly formed part of the Code of Criminal Procedure was to exclude from evidence confessions made to the regular police which had a very bad reputation for the methods it employed in investigation especially in forcibly extracting confessions with the object of securing a conviction It is too much to suppose that the <ORG> did intend that all persons who may have to investigate or arrest persons or seize articles in pursuance of any particular law of which at the time it had no conception should be considered to be so unreliable that any confession made to them must be excluded just as a confession made to a regular police officer If it could not contemplate the later creation of offences or of agencies to take action in respect to them under future legislation it could not have intended the expression police officer to include officers entrusted in future with the duty of detecting and preventing smuggling and similar offences with the object of safeguarding the levying and recovery of <ORG> duties If the <ORG> had intended to use the expression police officer for such a wide purpose it would have used a more comprehensive expression It could have expressed its intention more clearly by making any confession made to any officer whose duty is to detect and prevent the commission of offences inadmissible in evidence The police officer referred to in of the Evidence Act need not be the officer investigating into that particular offence of which a person is subsequently accused <ORG> Officers can even if the respondent contention be accepted be considered to be police officers only when they are exercising the limited powers which are similar to the powers of the police officers This is clear from the observations in the cases relied upon on behalf of the respondent is that in section of the Act in respect of an officer of the police there is a personal disability implied irrespective of the question whether be is holding an investigation or not while no such disability can be said to have been intended in the case of an excise officer Section empowers a police officer to seize articles liable to confiscation under the Act on suspicion that they had been stolen Section provides that the officer adjudging confiscation shall take and hold posses sion of the thing confiscated and every officer of police on request of such officer shall assist him in taking and holding such possession Section A of the Act empowers the <ORG> Officer to summon any person to give evidence or to produce a document or any other thing in any enquiry which he be making in connection with the smuggling of any goods It would be highly incongruous that moat of the offences under be disposed of by the <ORG> Officers themselves and that such confessional statements recorded by <ORG> Officers be good material for them to take action and to penalize the offender to any amount of fine and yet the and statements be held to be not admissible in evidence if they have to be used at a trial for a criminal offence in a regular Court of law We therefore allow the appeal set aside the order of acquittal of the respondent for the aforesaid offences and restore the order of conviction passed by the Magistrate and confirmed by the Sessions Judge We make it clear however that we do not express any opinion on the question whether officers of departments other than the police on whom the powers of an Officer in charge of a Police Station under ch XIV of the Code of Criminal Procedure have been conferred are police officers or not for the purpose of of the Evidence Act as the learned counsel for the appellant did not question the correctness of this view for the purpose of this appeal I cannot bring myself to hold that while a confession made by an accused to a police officer is not admissible in evidence in a Court of law the same if made under exactly similar circumstances to a customs officer can be relied and acted upon Against the said order the accused filed revisions to <ORG> Apart from the confessions alleged to have been made by the accused there was no other evidence to prove that they were guilty of the offence with which they were charged It was contended before <ORG> that the said confessional statements were hit by of the Evidence Act and therefore they were inadmissible in evidence <ORG> accepting the contention held that if the statements were excluded there was no other evidence to sustain the conviction The State has preferred the present appeal against the acquittal of <NAME> Learned counsel for the <ORG> contended that <ORG> officials are not police officers within the meaning of of the Evidence Act and therefore the statements made by the respondents confessing their guilt were admissible in evidence and the convictions based thereon were sustainable The Indian Evidence Act Section No confession made to a police officer shall be proved as against a person accused of any offence All offences under any other law shall be investigated inquired into tried and otherwise dealt with according to the same provisions but subject to any enactment for the time being in force regulating the manner of place of investigating inquiring into trying or otherwise dealing with such offences Section the word police shall include all persons who shall be The police Act of gives an inclusive definition of the word Police and therefore it is not exhaustive and it comprehends not only such things as it signifies according to its natural import but also enlarges the meaning of the said word so as to take in other things Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure also contemplates investigation of or inquiry into offences under other enactments regulating the manner or place of investigation that is if an act creates an offence and regulates the manner and place of investigation or inquiry in regard to the said offence the procedure proscribed by the Code of Criminal Procedure will give place to that provided in that Act It may mean any one of the following categories of officers i a police officer who is a member of the police force constituted under the Police Act ii though not a member of the police force constituted under the Police Act an officer who by statutory fiction is deemed to be a police officer in charge of a police station under the Code of Criminal Procedure and iii an officer oh whom a statute confers powers and imposes duties of a police officer under the Code of Criminal Procedure without describing him as a police officer or equating him by fiction to such an officer What was the meaning which the legislature intended to give to the term police officer at the time the said section was enacted That section was taken out of the Criminal Procedure Code Act of and inserted in the Evidence Act of as <NAME> in his Introduction to the Evidence Act states at thus I may observe upon the provisions relating to them that sections and were transferred to the Evidence Act verbatim from the Code of Criminal Procedure Act XXV of I the legislature had in view the malpractices of police officers in extorting confessions from accused persons in order to gain credit by securing convictions and that those malpractices went to the length of positive torture nor do I doubt that the <ORG> in laying down such stringent rules regarded the evidence of police officers as untrustworthy and the object of the rules was to put a stop to the extortion of confession by taking The salutary principle underlying the section would apply equally to other officers by whatever designation they may be known who have the power and duty to detect The civil force to which is entrusted the duty of maintaining public order enforcing regulations for the prevention and punishment of breaches of the law and detecting crime construed as plural the members of a police force the constabulary of a locality A police officer appointed under the Police Act of has such powers and duties under the Code of Criminal Procedure but they are not confined only to such police officers As the State power and duties increased manifold acts which were at one time considered to be innocuous and even praiseworthy have become offences and the police power of the State gradually began to operate on different subjects The question therefore in each case is does the officer under a particular Act exercise the powers and discharge the duties of prevention and detection of crime If lie does he will be a police officer There is a conflict of judicial opinion on the question raised Answering that question the learned Chief Justice observed at thus in construing the th section of the Evidence Act of I consider that the term police officer should be read not in any technical sense but according to its more comprehensive and popular meaning In common parlance and amongst the generality of people the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner of <ORG> are understood to be officers of <ORG> or in other words police officers quite as much as the more ordinary members of the force It is true that in that case I the court was concerned with the question whether the Deputy Commissioner of Police was a police officer This decision stood the test of time and indeed it represented the contemporaneous judicial opinion of the time <NAME> after considering the relevant provisions and the case law on the subject came to the following conclusion at After giving then my best attention to the arguments which have been addressed to us in my judgment we should hold that as <ORG> has deliberately conferred upon these Abkari officers substantially all the powers of a Police officer they have thereby in effect made them Police officers within the meaning of <NAME> stated much to the same effect at It seems to me a perfectly fair interpretation of section to say that the <ORG> officer within the meaning of that section is an officer who exercises the powers of police conferred upon him by law whether he is called a <ORG> officer or he is called by any other name and exercises other functions also under other provisions of law He is a <ORG> officer within the meaning of section if in the investigation of offences under particular Act he exercises the powers of an officer in charge of a police station for the investigation of a cognizable offence conferred upon him by that Act It is true that of the Bombay Abkari Act stated Every such officer shall in the conduct of such investigation exercise the powers conferred by the Code of Criminal Procedure upon an officer in charge of a police station for the investigation of a cognizable offence A full Banch of <ORG> in <NAME> Emperor adopted the same test for deciding whether an officer was a police officer or not <NAME> who delivered the leading judgment after scrutinizing the relevant provisions and the cases concluded his discussion thus at It is the nature of the duties performance of which was likely to give occasion for improper influences being exercised or felt and not any particular aversion for a particular department of public service that must have moved the legislature in enacting the provision I am therefore of opinion that if matterrs which previously did not fall within the category of crime subsequently came to be recognized as such and on that officers have been appointed to discharge or have been vested with powers of discharging duties which a police officer had to discharge in then whatever may be the name of the department to which such officers may have been attached such officers must be regarded as coming within the term police officer with regard to whom section of the Evidence Act was intended to be applied This passage neatly summarises the law on the subject and I entirely agree with it <NAME> in a separate judgment came to the same conclusion and he stated at thus Since not only have new off noes been created by later Acts but new bodies of officers have been created who are vested with powers of police with regard to these offenses Then the learned Judge posed the question Would that make any difference to the application of the section to these officers and answered it thus at The words police officer may be plain but they are not defined in the Evidence Act On the other band it is quite consistent with the scheme of the Act that person who exercises the powers of a police officer should be hit by the prohibitive provision of section The learned Judges held that an excise officer invested with the powers of an officer in charge of a police station for investigation of offences under A I Mad <NAME> made the following observations at There is no exhaustive definition of the expression Police Officer in any of our statutes In the absence of a statutory definition and apart from all authority one would be tempted to say that a police officer is a person whom any statute or other provision of law calls such or on whom it confers all or substantially all the powers and imposes the duties of a police officer If he is expressly called a police officer there is no difficulty whatsoever If he is not so called then the next step is to ask what does the law require him to do What are the ditties imposed on him and what are the powers conferred on him If these are substantially those of a police officer there need be no qualms in regarding him as one The material thing to consider would be not the name given to him nor the colour of the uniform be is required to wear but his functions powers and duties A police officer does not cease to be such merely because he is put into a white khadder uniform instead of one in khaki drill a medicine will be just the same whether it is packaged in a glass jar or a plastic container This passage in my view lays down with clarity the real test for determining whether a particular officer is a police officer or not within the meaning of a statute That Court swung to the other extreme and held that the distinction between a person who is nothing but a Police Officer and one who is primarily not a Police Officer but merely invested with the powers of a Police Officer is material and cannot be ignored for the purpose of Construing section of the Evidence Act on the basis of the said principle it came to the Condition that an Excise Officer was not a Police Officer within the meaning of of the Evidence Act With at respect to the learned Judges who decided that case I think that they looked too narrowly at the appearance of things and declined to look at the substance behind the appearance If that interpretation be correct an officer who is simply designated as a police officer will come under the mischief of of the Evidence Act whereas an officer who is not described as a police officer but who is entrusted with all the police powers and duties would not be hit by it In coming to that conclusion the learned Judge distinguished a decision of a division bench of <ORG> on the ground that the Ordinance on which that decision turned specifically mentioned that in conducting the investigation particular officers would have all the powers duties privileges and liabilities of an officer in charge of a police station under the Criminal Procedure Code I do not see how that circumstance makes a difference in the application of of the Evidence Act The fact that that Ordinance by reference to the Code of Criminal Procedure conferred powers on the Commercial Tax Officers but the Sea <ORG> Act conferred similar powers not by reference to any Code but by express enactment could not make any difference in the application of the principle I shall consider at a later stage the scope of the powers conferred by the Sea <ORG> Act on a <ORG> Officer in the matter of prevention detection and investigation of crimes though powers of prevention and detection were conferred on a <ORG> Officer no powers of investigation was given to him I shall consider this aspect at a later stage If a literal meaning is given to the term police officer indicating thereby an officer designated as police officer it will lead to anomalous results An officer designated as a police officer even though he does not discharge the well understood police functions will be hit by of the Evidence Act whereas an officer not so designated but who has all the powers of a police officer would not be hit by that section with the result the object of the section would be defeated The intermediate position namely that an officer can be a police officer only if powers and duties pertaining to an officer in charge of a police station within the meaning of the Code of Criminal Procedure are entrusted to him would also lead to an equally anomalous position for it would exclude from its operation a case of an officer on whom specific powers and functions are conferred under specific statutes without reference to the Code of Criminal Procedure A police officer within the meaning of of the Evidence Act may be defined thus An officer by whatever designation he is called on whom a statute substantially confers the powers and imposes the duties of the police is a police officer within the meaning of of the Evidence Act Section of the Sea <ORG> Act opens out with the following words The offences mentioned in the first column of the following schedule shall be punishable to the extent mentioned in the third column of the same with reference to such offences respectively Chapter XVI of the Act deals with offences and penalties The first column gives the particulars of offences the second column gives the section to which the offence has reference and the third column gives the penalties in respect of each offence Chapter XVII prescribes the procedure relating to Offences appeals etc Section confers on an officer of <ORG> duly employed in the prevention of smuggling the power to search on reasonable suspicion any person on board of any vessel in any port in India or within the Indian customs waters or any person who has landed from any vessel Section empowers such officer to board a vessel for searching it an order to ascertain whether any breach of the Act or any other law relating to customs has been or is being or is likely to be committed Section A which was inserted by Act of gives power to the said officer to summon persons to give evidence and produce documents presumably to facilitate investigation of the offence The said sections therefore create offences and for the purpose of prevention and detection of such offences confer specific powers on the <ORG> officers to search persons or places to arrest persons suspected of such offences and to make necessary investigation in respect thereof The <ORG> officers under the Act have the powers and they also discharge the functions of police officers and therefore they are police officers for the purpose of the Evidence Act in so far as they exercise or discharge such powers and functions If so it follows that a confession made to him cannot be proved against a person accused of an offence In the present case it is not disputed that if the confession made by the respondent to the <ORG> officers was excluded there would be no other evidence on which the conviction could be sustained
