Therefore the respondent issued a general notice to those workmen and individually to each workman notifying that unless he recorded his willingness to discharge his duties faithfully and diligently so as to give a certain minimum output he will be no longer employed and that he must record his willingness in the office by a certain time failing which he shall stand discharged from the service of the respondent without any further notice failed to record their willingness the respondent issued a notice discharging their services A general strike followed resulting in a joint application by both the parties to the <ORG> and the <ORG> referred the question to the <ORG> whether the discharge of the workmen was justified The <ORG> came to the conclusion that there was go slow during the period and consequently held that the discharge of the workmen was fully justified In appeal by <ORG> the appellant contended that i all that the <ORG> was concerned with was to decide whether the discharge of the workmen for not giving an undertaking was justified or not and that it was no part of the duty of the <ORG> to decide whether there was go slow which would justify the order of discharge ii Since the respondent held no enquiry as required by the Standing Orders it could not justify the discharge before the <ORG> and iii the finding of the <ORG> that go slow had been proved was perverse and the <ORG> had ignored relevant evidence in coming to the conclusion i Taking into account the wide terms of reference the manner in which it was understood before the <ORG> and the fact that it must read alongwith the two notices particularly because it was made soon thereafter at the joint application of the parties the <ORG> was entitled to go into the real dispute between the parties namely whether the discharge was justified on the ground that there was misconduct in the form of go slow by the workmen concerned ii No distinction can be made between cases when the domestic enquiry is invalid and those where no enquiry has in fact been held This Court has consistently held that if the domestic enquiry is irregular invalid or improper the <ORG> may give an opportunity to the employer to prove his case and in doing so the <ORG> tries the merits itself iii As the case involved the discharge of workmen this Court went into the evidence and the evidence showed that the decision of the <ORG> was not wrong that there Was go slow and that the discharge was fully justified When the position became serious the respondent issued a general notice on December inviting the attention of the workmen concerned to this state of affairs which had been continuing of any rate since November A copy was also sent to the Secretary of the union with the workmen concerned to submit their willingness as desired by the respondent in the notice in question either individually or even collectively through the union In consequence of this attitude of the workmen the respondent issued a notice at on December which was in the following terms The following workers of the cane carrier station who failed to record their willingness in factory manager office by this day the th December to work faithfully and diligently in accordance with the management notice dated stand discharged from the company service and their names have been struck off the rolls with effect from th December From now on the workers concerned have forfeited their right to go to and occupy their former place of work and any action contrary to this on their part will make them liable to prosecution for criminal trespass The strike continued upto December when as a result of an agreement it was decided that the case of the discharged workmen and the question of wages for the strike period be referred to adjudication If not whether they should be re instated and or they are entitled to any other relief Whether the workmen be paid wages for the period hrs Therefore when the matter went before the tribunal the question that was tried was whether there was go slow between November and December The respondent led evidence which was mainly documentary and based on the past performance of the factory to show that there was in fact go slow by the workmen concerned during this period The appellants on the other hand also relying on the record of the respondent tried to prove that the cane carrier department had been giving normal work in accordance with what had happened in the past in connection with cane crushing That is how the tribunal considered the question on the basis of the relevant statistics supplied by both parties and also oral evidence whether there was go slow during this period or not After considering all the evidence it came to the conclusion that there was go slow during this period It therefore answered the first question referred to it in favour of the respondent Thereafter the appellants came to this Court and obtained special leave and that is how the matter has come up before us We are concerned in the present appeal only with the first question which was referred to the tribunal Learned counsel for the appellants has raised three main contentions before us in support of the appeal In the first place it is contended that the tribunal misdirected itself as to the Scope of the reference and that all that the tribunal was concerned with was to decide whether the discharge of the workmen for not giving an undertaking was justified or not and that it was no part of the duty of the tribunal to decide whether there was go slow between the relevant dates which would justify the order of discharge Secondly it is urged that the respondent had given no charge sheets to the workmen concerned and had held no enquiry as required by the Standing Orders Therefore it was not open to the respondent to justify the discharge before the tribunal and the tribunal had no jurisdiction to go into the merits of the question relating to go slow Lastly it is urged that the finding of the tribunal that go slow had been proved was perverse and the tribunal had ignored relevant evidence in coming to that conclusion We shall deal with these contentions seriatim We have already set out the relevant term of reference and it will be seen that it is wide and general in terms and asks the tribunal to decide whether the discharge of the workmen concerned was justified or not It does not mention the grounds on which the discharge was based and it is for the tribunal to investigate the grounds and decide whether those grounds justify discharge or not But the argument on behalf of the appellants is that the notice of December gives the reason for the discharge and the tribunal confined only to that notice and has to consider whether the reason given in that notice for discharge is justified We have already set out that notice and it certainly says that the workmen mentioned at the foot of the notice had failed to record their willingness to work faithfully and diligently in accordance with the respondent notice of December and therefore they stood discharged from the respondent services and their names had been struck off the rolls from December The tribunal had therefore to see whether this reason for the discharge of the workmen was justifiable and that it had no jurisdiction to go beyond this and to investigate the question of go slow We are of opinion that there is no force in this argument Apart from the question that both parties before the tribunal went into the question of go slow and voluminous evidence was led from both sides either to prove that there was go slow or to disprove the same it appears to us that it would be taking much too technical a view to hold that the discharge was due merely to the failure of the workmen to give the undertaking and that the go slow had nothing to do with the discharge We are of opinion that the two notices of December and December have to be read together and it may be pointed out that the notice of December th does refer to the earlier notice of December th If we read the two notices together there can be in our opinion be no doubt that though the discharge is worded as if it was due to the failure to record their willingness to work faithfully and diligently it was really due to the workmen concerned using go slow tactics It states that on the instigation of the secretary of the union the workmen had been failing in their duty to ensure adequate and regular loading of the cane carrier from the very beginning of the season In this part the respondent told the workmen concerned that unless they voluntarily recorded their willingness individually to discharge their duties faithfully and diligently by feeding the cane carrier so as to give a minimum average daily crush of maunds excluding stoppages other than those due to over loading or under loading of the cane carrier they would be considered to be no longer employed by the respondent They were given time up to on December to record their willingness failing which they would stand discharged from the respondent service without any further notice with effect from December Assuming that this course adopted by the respondent was unjust and even improper reading of the two parts of the notice of December shows that in the opinion of the respondent was the normal cane crushing per day and what was the charge of the respondent against the workmen concerned in the matter of go slow and what the respondent was prepared to accept if the workmen were agreeable to the claim of the respondent It is in the background of this charge contained in the notice of December that we have to read the notice of December That notice says that the workmen had failed to record their willingness to work faithfully and diligently in accordance with the notice of December and therefore they stood discharged meaning thereby that the respondent was charging the workmen with go slow as indicated in the notice of December and that as they were not prepared to give normal production even in future they were being discharged Therefore though in form the notice of December reads as if the workmen were being discharged for not giving the undertaking as desired the real basis of the notice of discharge of December is the use of goslow which had already been indicated in the notice of December given to each workman individually also The reference was made on the joint application of both parties If all that the workmen desired in their joint application for reference was that it should only be considered whether the discharge of the workmen for refusing to give an undertaking was justified there was nothing to prevent the workmen to insist that in the joint application this matter should be specifically mentioned In the joint application the first matter which was specified was in these terms Whether the discharge of workmen mentioned in the appendix was justified If not whether they should be reinstated and or they are entitled to any other relief Now if all that was desired was that the tribunal should go into the question whether the discharge of the workmen on the ground that they had failed to give the undertaking should be investigated it would have been easy to put this term only in the reference in the joint application thus Whether the discharges of the workmen mentioned in the appendix on the ground of their failure to give an undertaking was justified The very fact that the matter specified as in dispute was put in the wide words already quoted above shows that the parties did not wish to confine their dispute only to the question whether the discharge on the ground of failure to give an undertaking was justified The wide terms in which the reference was made along with the notice of December th read with the notice of December th leave no doubt in our mind that the reference included investigation of any cause which might have led to the discharge of the workmen There is no doubt in this case that even though notice of discharge was pharsed as if the discharge was being made on account of the failure to give an undertaking the real reason for the discharge was that the workmen had been guilty of go slow between November and December and were not prepared in spite of the respondent giving them a chance to improve to show better results Therefore taking into account the wide terms of reference the manner in which it was understood before the tribunal and the fact that it must be read along with the two notices of December and particularly because it was made soon thereafter at the joint application of the parties we have no doubt that the tribunal was entitled to go into the real dispute between the parties namely whether the discharge was justified on the ground that there was misconduct in the form of go slow by the workmen concerned between November workmen therefore on this head must be rejected Then we come to the question whether it was open to the tribunal when there was no enquiry whatsoever by the respondent to hold an enquiry itself into the question of go slow It was urged on behalf of the appellants that not only there was no enquiry in the present case but there was no charge either We do not agree that there was no charge by the respondent against the workmen concerned The first part of the notice of December which was served on each individual workmen was certainly a charge by the respondent telling the workmen concerned that they were guilty of go slow for the period between November and December It is now well settled by a number of decisions of this Court that where an employer has failed to make an enquiry before dismissing or discharging a workman it is open to him to justify the action before the tribunal by leading all relevant evidence before it In such a case the employer would not have the benefit which he had in cases where domestic inquiries have been held <NAME> and reference was also made to the decision of <ORG> in <NAME> <ORG> It was pointed out that the import effect of commission to hold an enquiry was merely this that the tribunal would not have to consider only whether there was a prima facie case but would decide for itself on the evidence adduced whether the charges have really been made out But in principle we see no difference whether the matter comes before the tribunal for approval under or on a reference under of the Industrial Disputes Act In either case if the enquiry is defective or if no enquiry has been held as required by Standing Orders the entire case would be open before the tribunal and the employer would have to justify on facts as well that its order of dismissal or discharge was proper that in that case there was an enquiry though it was defective A defective enquiry in our opinion stands on the same footing as no enquiry and in either case the tribunal would have jurisdiction to go into the facts and the employer would have to satisfy the tribunal that on facts the order of dismissal or discharge was proper If it is held that in cases where the employer dismisses his employee without holding an enquiry the dismissal must be set aside by the industrial tribunal only on that ground it would inevitably mean that the employer will immediately proceed to hold the enquiry and pass an order dismissing the employee once again In that case another industrial dispute would arise and the employer would be entitled to rely upon the enquiry which he had held in the mean time This course would mean delay and on the second occasion it will entitle the employer to claim the benefit of the domestic enquiry given On the other hand if in such cases the employer is given an opportunity to justify the That is why this <ORG> has consistently held that if the domestic enquiry is irregular invalid or improper the tribunal give an opportunity to the employer to prove his case and in doing so the tribunal tries the merits itself This view is consistent with the approach which industrial adjudication generally adopts with a view to do justice between the parties without relying too much on technical considerations and with the object of avoiding delay in the disposal of industrial disputes Therefore we are satisfied that no distinction can be made between cases where the domestic enquiry is invalid and those where no enquiry has in fact been held We must therefore reject the contention that as there was no enquiry in this case it was not open to the respondent to justify the discharge before the tribunal iii The question whether there was go slow during the period from November to December is a question of fact and the tribunal has come to the conclusion that there was go slow during this period Ordinarily this <ORG> does not go into findings of fact recorded by a tribunal unless there are special reasons as for example where the finding is based on no evidence which of course is not the case here For this purpose we may first refer to the past history of the working of the respondent factory In a court of enquiry was constituted to enquire into this question and it made a report that there was a slow down on the part of the workman for several days in February March It also came to the conclusion that the slow down was instigated and sponsored by union leaders We have already referred to the fact that the workmen were dissatisfied with the new incentive bonus scheme proposed by the respondent But it appears that when there was dispute in the season on the question of how much cane should be crushed the secretary of the union had accepted in a conference with the Assistant Labour Commissioner that there had been a drop in the amount of cane crushed though he maintained that it was still the average crush Further it was admitted by the secretary in his evidence that when the bonus scheme was proposed in it was considered by the workmen in a meeting and it was decided that if the new system was introduced without the consent of the workmen they would not put in any extra effort for giving more than what was the normal crush in the mill The evidence also shows that there were conferences about the new scheme and at one stage the respondent suggested that the norm should be maunds crush per day while the union was agreeable to maunds per day But there was no agreement in this behalf and so that workmen carried out their resolve not to put in extra efforts to give more than the average normal crushing per day It is in the background of this history and this admission that we have to look broadly into the evidence to see whether the tribunal conclusion that there was go slow is justified The main contention on behalf of the respondent in this connection is that one has to see is that is called crushing speed for a day of hours and it is this crushing speed which would determine whether there was go slow during the period in dispute It has been urged that crushing speed per hours is different from the actual crushing per day or the average crushing for a period for the actual crushing per day from which the crushing speed is arrived at depends on a number of factors particularly it depends on the amount of stoppages that take place during the day and if there are more stoppages the actual crushing on a particular day would necessarily go down The case of the respondent further is that when it gave the notice on December asking for a crush of maunds per day it really meant that the workmen should work in such a way as to give a crushing speed of maunds per day though the words crushing speed were not actually used in the notice Therefore the respondent wanted the workmen to give a crushing speed of maunds per day which would exclude stoppages the only exception being stoppages due to over loading or underloading which according to the respondent is due to the deliberate action of the cane carrier workmen to cause stoppages We think that this explanation of what the respondent meant when it gave the notice of average daily crush of maunds is reasonable for it is impossible to accept that maunds were required to be crushed irrespective of stoppages beyond the control of the workmen Further it is not in dispute that the labour force was more or less the same throughout these years and therefore we have to see whether during the period from November to December there was any significant drop in the crushing speed If there was such a significant drop that could only be due to go slow tactics which have been euphemistically called withdrawal of extra efforts It is necessary therefore to took at the charts produced in this case to determine this question That is however a chart of actual crushing per day during the period from to and has nothing to do with crushing speed which in our opinion would be the determining factor in finding out whether there was go slow We consider that it would not be proper to take the figures for the years to in which years incentive bonus schemes were in force and which according to the workmen resulted in extra efforts on their part That however would not be an accurate way of finding out whether in fact there was go slow during the period with which we are concerned This chart in our opinion is the proper chart for determining whether there was go slow during the revelant period It appears that from the middle of season night weighment of carts started and it is not in dispute that resulted in an increase in the daily crushing and this increase is put at over maunds per day by the respondent the secretary of the union admitted that this would result in an increase of about maunds per day We have already said that in the years and there was no incentive bonus and if these figures are accepted as giving the average crushing speed per day when there was no incentive bonus and no weighment of carts at night it would in our opinion be not improper to accept that the crushing speed with night weighment of carts would be in the neighbourhood of maunds per day in view of the admission that night weighment of carts resulted in an increase of crushing by about maunds to maunds per day Therefore when the respondent gave notice on December that the average crushing per day should be maunds excluding stoppages except those due to over loading or underloading of the cane carrier for which the workmen would be responsible it Cannot be said that the respondent had fixed something which was abnormal It is true that when negotiations were taking place in connection with the incentive bonus scheme for the year the respondent was prepared to accept a crushing speed of maunds per day above which the incentive bonus scheme would apply It has been urged on behalf of the appellants that the crushing speed of maunds per hours is not correctly arrived at for it does not take into account half hour rest per shift which is permissible under of the Factories Act No of Section is in these terms <ORG> may make rules in respect of adult workers in factories providing for the exemption to such extent and subject to such conditions as may be prescribed of workers engaged in any work which for technical reasons must be carried on continuously from the provisions of sections and We are of opinion that this provision in being a special provision will over ride both sub ss and of for it gives power to <ORG> by making rules to exempt certain types of factories from the application of the whole of subject to such conditions and to such extent as the rules may provide It appears that rules were framed in this behalf by <ORG> in by which sugar factories were exempted from the application of for purposes of handling and crushing of cane among others subject to the condition that the workers concerned shall be allowed to take light refreshment or meals at the place of their employment or in a room specially reserved for the purposes or in a canteen provided in the factory once during any period exceeding four hours We may also refer to which lays down that the rules made under this section shall remain in force for not more than three years The rules to which reference has been made are of but there is nothing to show that these rules were not continued after every interval of three years and the position that the exemption applies to sugar factories even now as provided in these rules was not disputed We shall therefore proceed on the basis that the exemption applied to sugar factories in Bihar In view of this the workmen cannot claim half an hour rest per shift as urged on their behalf though sometime must be allowed for refreshment or light meals as provided in the provision granting exemption That chart shows a crushing speed of maunds per day from November to when according to the respondent there was only mild go slow Now if we take the average crushing speed as maunds per hours without any adjustment or even a little over maunds with adjustment following upon the rule relating to exemption from there is certainly a significant drop in average crushing speed during this period Further we find that there is a significant drop even as compared to the period between November to inasmuch as the drop was over maunds per day It may be added that when comparisons are made on the basis of crushing speed and labour force is more or less constant as is the ease here other minor factors to which our attention was drawn on behalf of the appellants during argument do not matter at all Even if we take the figure of maunds as the crushing speed which the respondent had put forward at the time of the discussion on the incentive bonus scheme we find that though there was not much difference during the period from November to November there was a significant drop of over maunds per day from November to December Finally it is urged that notice was given to the workmen on December and they were discharged on December without giving them a change to give the necessary production as desired in the notice Even assuming that the demand of an undertaking was unjustified it does appear that the attitude of the workmen was that they would do no better and in those circumstances they were discharged on December on the basis of misconduct consisting of go slow between November and December In the circumstances we order parties to bear their own costs
