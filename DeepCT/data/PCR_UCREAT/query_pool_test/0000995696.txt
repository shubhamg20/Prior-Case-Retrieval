We are unable to accept Mr <NAME> contention that the Code does not contemplate the rejection of a claim of a mortgagee as such the decision in <NAME> <NAME> I shows that claims founded on mortgages are as much within the rule as any other claim The learned Counsel for the appellant has quoted no cases to the contrary the decision <NAME> <NAME> I refers to the question of possession being disturbed after sale that has no bearing on the present question Mr <NAME> contention that as there was no investigation the one year rule does not apply comes too late in the day The language of Article in the new Act is more comprehen sive than that of the previous Act and that has been construed in this Court as covering orders after full investigation as well as orders passed on default We entirely agree with these decisions The second appeal must be dismissed with costs
