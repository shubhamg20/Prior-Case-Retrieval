HEADNOTE Clause of the Cotton Textile Control of Movement Order promulgated by <ORG> under section of the Essential Supplies Temporary Powers Act does not deprive a citizen of the right to dispose of or transport cotton tex tiles purchased by him It requires him to take a permit from the Textile Commissioner to enable him to transport them The grant or a refusal of a permit is to be governed by the policy and the discretion given to the Textile Commissioner is to be exercised in such a way as to effectuate this policy The conferment of such a discretion cannot be called invalid and if there is an abuse of power there is ample power in Courts to undo the mischief Section of the Act enumerates the classes of persons to whom the power could be delegated or sub delegated by <ORG> and it is not correct to say that the instrumentalities have not been selected by the <ORG> itself Even assuming that the existing law stands repealed by implication such abrogation or repeal is by force of the legislative declaration contained in section and is not by force of the order made by the delegate under section Accordingly there is no delegation involved in the provision of section and it cannot be held uncon stitutional on that ground Appeal by Special Leave from the Judgment and Order of the High Court of Judicature at Nagpur dated the th The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> facts giving rise to this appeal are these The appellant <NAME> and his wife Smt <NAME> were arrested at Itarsi by <ORG> on the th November for contravention of section of the Essential Supplies Temporary Powers Act read with clause of the Cotton Textiles Control of Movement Order After various vicissitudes through which the chalan passed the case was eventually withdrawn by <ORG> to itself on the rd of September as it involved a decision of constitutional issues It also upheld the constitutionality of the impugned Order Section of the Act was held to be inconsistent with the provisions of the Railway Act but it was held that its unconstitutionality did not affect the prosecution in this case Mr <NAME> who appeared in this and the connected appeal urged the following points for our consideration and decision That sections and of the Essential Supplies Temporary Powers Act and the provisions of the Cotton Cloth Control Order contravened the fundamental right of the appellants guaranteed by article and of the Constitution That section of the Essential Supplies Temporary Powers Act and in particular section were ultra vires the <ORG> on the ground of excessive delegation of legislative power That section having been found ultra vires section was inextricably connected with it and that both the sections should have been declared ultra vires on that ground and That the impugned Control Order contravened existing laws viz In our judgment none of the points raised by Mr <NAME> have any validity The Central Government so far as it appears to it to be necessary or expedient for maintaining or increasing supplies of any essential commodity or for socuring their equitable distribution and availability at fair prices may by order provide for regulating or prohibiting the production supply and distribution thereof and trade and commerce therein Without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred by sub section an order made thereunder may provide a for regulating by licences permits or otherwise the production or manufacture of any essential com modity for regulating by licences permits or otherwise the storage transport distribution disposal acquisition use or consumption of any essential commodity <ORG> may by notified order direct that the power to make orders under section shall in relation to such matters and subject to such conditions if any as may be specified in the direction be exercisable also by a such officer or authority subordinate to the Central Government or such State Government or such officer or authority subordinate to a State Government as may be specified in the direction Any order made under section shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any enactment other than this Act or any instrument having effect by virtue of any enactment other than this Act Under powers conferred by section <ORG> promulgated on th September Cotton Textiles Control of Movement Order Section of this order defines the expressions apparel carrier hosiery cloth and textile commissioner The first question canvassed by Mr <NAME> was that the provisions of section of the Control Order infringed the rights of a citizen guaranteed in subclauses and of article of the Constitution These sub clauses recognise the right of a citizen to dispose of property and to carry on trade or business The requirement of a permit to transport by rail cotton textiles to a certain extent operates as a restriction on the rights of a person who is engaged in the business of purchase and sale of cotton textiles Clause of the Control Order does not deprive a citizen of the right to dispose of or transport cotton textiles purchased by him It requires him to take a permit from the Textile Commissioner to enable him to transport them Act XXIV of was an emergency measure and as stated in its preamble was intended to provide for the continuance during a limited period of powers to control the production supply and distribution of and trade and commerce in certain commodities If the permit had been applied for and refused arbitrarily they might then have had a right to attack the law on A the ground that it vested arbitrary and unregulated power in the textile commissioner They were transporting essential goods by rail without a permit and the only way they can get any relief is by attacking the section which obliges them to take a permit before they can transport by rail essential commodities Section of the Uttar Pradesh Coal Control Order was declared void on the ground that it committed to the unrestrained will of a single individual to grant withhold or cancel licences in any way he chose and there was nothing in the Order which could ensure a proper execution of the power or operate as a check upon injustice that might result from improper execution of the same Provided that every power which is under this Order exercisable by <ORG> shall also be exercisable by the State Coal Controller or any person authorized by him in this behalf In the present Control Order there is no such provision as existed in the Uttar Pradesh Coal Control Order The grant or refusal of a permit is thus to be governed by this policy and the discretion given to <ORG> is to be exercised in such a way as to effectuate this policy cannot be called invalid and if there is an abuse of the power there is ample power in the Courts to undo the mischief Presumably as appears from the different forms published in the Manual there are directions and rules laid down by <ORG> for the grant or refusal of permits The next contention of Mr <NAME> that section of the Essential Supplies Temporary Powers Act amounts to delegation of Legislative power outside the permissible limits is again without any merit In other words the legislature cannot delegate its function of laying down legislative policy in respect of a measure and its formulation as a rule of conduct The essential legislative function consists in the determination or choice of the legislative policy and of formally enacting that policy into a binding rule of conduct In the present case the legislature has laid down such a principle and that principle is the maintenance or increase in supply of essential commodities and of securing equitable distribution and availability at fair prices Delegation of the kind mentioned in section was upheld before the Constitution in a number of decisions of their Lordships of <ORG> vide <NAME> The <NAME> <NAME> The <NAME> and <NAME> <ORG> and since the coming into force of the Constitution delegation of this character has been upheld in a number of decisions of this Court on principles enunciated by the majority in the Delhi Laws Act case Section of the Act was attacked on the ground that it empowers <ORG> to delegate its own power to make orders under section to any officer or authority subordinate to it or <ORG> or to any officer or authority subordinate to <ORG> as specified in the direction given by <ORG> Mr <NAME> contended that it was for the <ORG> itself to specify the particular authorities or officers who could exercise power under section and it was not open to the <ORG> to empower <ORG> to say what officer or authority could exercise the power Reference in this connection was made to two decisions of <ORG> of the United States of America <ORG> <NAME> and <NAME> United States In both these cases it was held that so long as the policy is laid down and a standard established by a statute no unconstitutional delegation of legislative power is involved in leaving to selected instrumentalities the making of subordinate rules within prescribed limits and the determination of facts to which the policy as declared by the <ORG> is to apply These decisions in our judgment do not help the contention of Mr <NAME> as we think that section enumerates the classes of persons to whom the power could be delegated or sub delegated by <ORG> and it is not correct to say that the instrumentalities have not been selected by the <ORG> itself The decision of their Lordships of <ORG> in <NAME> case completely negatives the contention raised regarding the invalidity of section Governor in <ORG> was given power to vest in a marketing board the powers conferred by section A of the Natural Products Marketing British Columbia Act The attack on the Act was that without constitutional authority it delegated legislative power to the Lt Governor in <ORG> or to give him powers of further delegation This objection appears to their Lordships subversive of the rights which <ORG> enjoys while dealing with matters falling within the classes of subjects in relation to which the Constitution has granted legislative powers Similar observations apply to clause which enables the Textile Commissioner to place an embargo on the transport of certain textiles from one area to another There is nothing in the provisions of the order which in any way overrides or supersedes the provisions of the different sections of the Railways Act referred to above The last contention of Mr <NAME> that section having been declared invalid section is inextricably mixed with it and should also have been declared invalid is also not valid because apart from the grounds given by <ORG> for holding that the two sections were not so interconnected that the invalidity of one would make the other invalid <ORG> was in error in holding that section was unconstitutional Section of the Act cited above declare that an order made under section shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any enactment other than this Act or any instrument having effect by virtue of any enactment other than this Act In other words it declares that if there is any repugnancy in an order made under section with the provisions of any other enactment then notwithstanding that inconsistency the provisions of the Order will prevail in preference to the provisions of other laws which are thus inconsistent with the provisions of the Order In the view of <ORG> the power to do something which may have the effect of repealing by implication an existing law could not be delegated in view of the majority decision of this Court in In Re Delhi Laws Act where it was held that to repeal or abrogate an existing law is the exercise of an essential legislative power In our opinion the construction placed on section by <ORG> is not right In other words the orders made under section would be operative in regard to the essential commodity covered by the Textile Control Order wherever there is repugnancy in this Order with the existing laws and to that extent the existing laws with regard to those commodities will not operate That law remains unrepealed but during the continuance of the order made under section it does not operate in that field for the time being Conceding how ever for the sake of argument that to the extent of a repugnancy between an order made under section and the provisions of an existing law to the extent of the repugnancy the existing law stands repealed by implication it seems to us that the repeal is not by any Act of the delegate but the repeal is by the legislative Act of the <ORG> itself By enacting section <ORG> itself has declared that an order made under section shall have effect notwithstanding any inconsistency in this order with any enactment other than this Act This is not a declaration made by the delegate but the <ORG> itself has declared its will that way in section The abrogation or the implied repeal is by force of the legislative declaration contained in section and is not by force of the order made by the delegate under section Once the delegate has made that order its power is exhausted Section then steps in wherein the <ORG> has declared that as soon as such an order comes into being that will have effect notwithstanding any inconsistency therewith contained in any enactment other than this Act <ORG> being supreme it certainly could make a law abrogating or repealing by implication provisions of any pre existing law and no exception could be taken on the ground of excessive delegation to the Act of the <ORG> itself There is no delegation involved in the provisions of section at all and that section could not be held to be unconstitutional on that ground The result therefore is that in our opinion the provisions of sections and of the Essential Supplies Temporary Powers Act are constitutional and Accordingly this appeal is dismissed and <ORG> is directed to proceed expeditiously with the case in accordance with law
