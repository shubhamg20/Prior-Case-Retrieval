grounds on which a detention order has been made or the representation made by him against the order of detention and is to that extent ultra vires and void Article of the Consti tution has no application to a law which relates directly to preventive detention even though as a result of an order of detention the rights referred to in sub cls may be restricted or abridged and the

cannot claim the right under sub el do not apply to a law relating to preventive detention inasmuch as there is a special self contained provision in Art Preventive detention is a direct infringe ment of the right guaranteed in Art even if a narrow construction is placed on the said sub clause and a law relating to preventive detention is therefore subject to such limited judicial review as is permitted by Art The concept of the right to move freely throughout the territory of India referred to in Art DAs Article protects some of the important attributes of personal liber ty as independent rights and the expression personal liber ty is used in Art as a compendious term including within Rs meaning all varieties of rights which go to make up the personal liberties of men does not refer to personal liberty and that it bears the restricted meaning attributed to it that is to say signi fies merely the right to move from one locality to another preventive detention must be held to affect this limited right of movement directly and substantially The same consideration applies to the cases of persons who are interned or externed To the extent that provision is made in Art The principles underlying Art and there is no conflict between these articles is not a self contained code relating to preventive detention and that Art does not form an exhaustive code by itself relating to preventive detention the word law has been used in the sense of <ORG> made law and not as an equivalent of law in the abstract or general sense embodying the principles of natural justice and procedure established by law means procedure established by law made by the <ORG> that is to say the Union <ORG> or the Legislatures of the <ORG>s It is not proper to construe this expression in the light of the meaning given to Procedure established by law does not however mean any procedure which may be prescribed by a competent legislature but the ordinary well estab lished criminal procedure i those settled The only alternative to this con struction if a constitutional transgression is to be avoid ed is to interpret the reference to law as implying a constitutional amendment pro tanto for it is only a law enacted by the procedure provided for such amendment that could modify or override a fundamental right without contra vening Art <NAME> <NAME> is nothing revolutionary in the view that procedure established by law must include the four principles of elementary justice which inhere in and are at the root of all civilized systems of law and which have been stated by the American <ORG>s and jurists as consisting in notice opportunity to be heard impartial tribunal and orderly course of procedure Section of the Preventive Detention Act does not delegate any legislative power to an executive officer but merely confers on such officer a discretion to enforce the law made by the legislature and is not there fore invalid on this ground Section of the said Act is not invalid merely because it does not provide for an oral hearing or an opportunity to lead evidence but only gives right to make a representation Right to an oral hearing and right to give evidence are not necessarily implied in the right to make a representation given by Art that a person may be detained for such period as the A <ORG> thinks fit does not contravene Art Article means that <ORG> may prescribe either the circumstances under which or the class or classes of cases in which a person may be detained for a period longer than three months without reference to an advisory board The

purporting to be contents of any such communication or representation as is referred to in sub section Provided that nothing in this sub section shall apply to a disclosure made to his legal adviser by a person who is the subject of a detention order In the petition he has given various dates showing how he has been under detention since December Under the ordi nary Criminal Law he was sentenced to terms of imprisonment but those convictions were set aside While he was tires under detention under one of the orders of the Madras State Government on the st of March he was served with an order made under section of the Preventive Detention Act IV of He challenges the legality of the order as it is contended that Act IV of contravenes the provisions of articles and and the provisions of that Act are not in accordance with article of the Con stitution He has also challenged the validity of the order on the ground that it is issued mala fide Because of the penal provisions of section of the impugned Act the applicant has not disclosed the grounds supplied to him for his detention and the question of mala fides of the order therefore cannot be gone into under this petition The question of the validity of Act IV of was argued before us at great length In order to appreciate the rival contentions it is useful first to bear in mind the general scheme of the Constitution The ambit and limitations on their respective powers are found in article read with article Schedule VII Lists and of the Constitution For the <ORG> of India <ORG> is established and its powers and jurisdiction are set out in articles to Unlike the American Constitution there is no article vesting the judicial power of the <ORG> of India in <ORG> The material points substantially altering the edifice are first in the Preamble which declares india a Sovereign Democratic Republic to secure to all its citizens justice liberty and equality and to promote among them all frater nity Under article provision is made for legislation after the Constitution comes into operation It is there provided that the State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this Part and any law made in contraven tion of this clause shall to the extent of the contraven tion be void Therefore as regards future legislation also the Fundamental Rights in Part III have to be respected and unless otherwise saved by the provisions of the Consti tution they will be void to the extent they contravene the provisions of Part III Under article the legisla tive powers conferred under article are also made subject to the provisions of this Constitution which of course includes Part III dealing with the Fundamental Rights The term law in article is expressed to be wide enough to include Acts Ordinances Orders Bye laws Rules Regulations and even custom or usage having in the territory of India the force of law Right to Equality is found in articles Eight to Freedom in articles Right against Exploitation in articles and Right to Freedom of Religion in articles Cultural and Educational Rights in articles and Right to Property in article and Right to Constitu tional Remedies in articles In this case we are directly concerned only with the articles under the caption Right to Freedom and article which gives a remedy to enforce the rights conferred by this Part It is obvious that by the insertion of this Part the powers of the <ORG> and the <ORG> both of the Union and the <ORG>s are further curtailed and the right to enforce the Fundamental Rights found in Part III by a direct application to <ORG> is removed from the legislative control In the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution List I contains entries specifying items in respect of which the <ORG> has exclusive legislative powers Entry is in these terms preventive detention for reasons connected with <ORG> <ORG> or <ORG> persons subjected to such detention List III of that Schedule enumerates topics on which both the Union and the <ORG>s have concurrent legislative powers Entry of that List is in these terms Preventive detention for reasons connected with the security of a <ORG> the maintenance of public order or the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community persons subjected to such detention It is not disputed that Act IV of is covered by these two Entries in List I and List III of the Seventh Schedule The contention of the peti tioner is that the impugned legislation abridges or in fringes the rights given by articles and is also not in accordance with the permissive legislation on preventive detention allowed under articles and and in particular is an infringement of the provisions of article It is therefore necessary to consider in detail each of these articles and the arguments advanced in respect thereof All citizens shall have the right a to free dom of speech and expression to assemble peaceably and without arms to form associations or unions to move freely throughout the territory of India to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India to acquire hold and dispose of property and to practise any profession or to carry on any occupation trade or business Nothing in sub clause a of clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it relates to or prevent the <ORG> from making any law relat ing to libel slander defamation contempt of court or any matter which offends against decency or morality or which undermines the security of or tends to overthrow the <ORG> Nothing in sub clause of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposts or prevent the <ORG> from making any law imposing in the interests of public order reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right con ferred by the said sub clause Nothing in sub clause of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposes or prevent the <ORG> from making any law imposing in the interests of public order or morality reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by the said sub clause Nothing in sub clauses and of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposes or prevent the <ORG> from making any law imposing reasonable restrictions on the exercise of any of the rights conferred by the said sub clauses either in the interests of the general public or for the protection of the interests of <ORG> Nothing in sub clause of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposes or prevent the State from making any law imposing in the interests of the general public reasonable restric tions on the exercise of the right conferred by the said sub clause and in particular nothing in the said sub clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it prescribes or empowers any authority to prescribe or prevent the State from making any law prescribing or empowering any authority to prescribe the professional or technical qualifications necessary for practising any pro fession or carrying on any occupation trade or business In the first place it is necessary to notice that there is a distinction between rights given to citizens and persons In order to determine whether a right is abridged or infringed it is first necessary to determine the extent of the right given by the articles and the limitations pre scribed in the articles themselves permitting its curtail ment Even in their absence if any of the fundamental rights was infiringed by any legislative enactment the <ORG> has always the power to declare the enactment to the extent it transgresses the limits invalid The existence of article and in the Constitution therefore is not material for the decision of the question what fundamental right is given and to what extent it is permitted to be abridged by the Constitution itself As the preventive detention order results in the deten tion of the applicant in a cell it was contended on his behalf that the rights specified in article a and have been infringed It was argued that because of his detention he cannot have a free right to speech as and where he desired and the same argument was urged in respect of the rest of the rights mentioned in sub clauses and Although this argu ment is advanced in a case which deals with preventive detention if correct it should be applicable in the case of punitive detention also to any one sentenced to a term of imprisonment under the relevant section of the Indian Penal Code Unless such conclusion necessarily follows from the article it is obvious that such construction should be avoided The article has to be read without any pre conceived notions If there is a legislation directly attempting to control a citizen freedom of speech or expression or his right to assemble peaceably and without arms etc the question whether that legislation is saved by the relevant saving clause of article will arise Any other construction put on the article it seems to me It was next urged that while this interpretation may meet the contention in respect of rights under article a and the right given by article is left untouched That sub clause expressly gives the right to move freely throughout the territory of India It was argued that by the confinement of the peti tioner under the preventive detention order his right to move freely throughout the territory of India is directly abridged and therefore the <ORG> must show that the im pugned legislation imposes only reasonable restrictions on the exercise of that right in the interests of the general public or for the protection of the interests of <ORG> under article The <ORG> is thus en joined to inquire whether the restrictions imposed on the detained person are reasonable in the interests of the general public Article of the Constitution gives the right to equality in these terms The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India Similarly it was urged that the words territory of India in article may be treated as superfluous and preventive detention would thus be an abridgement of the right to move freely mean ing the sub clause only means that if restrictions are sought to be put upon movement of a citizen from State to State or even within a State such restrictions will have to be tested by the permissive limits prescribed in clause of that Article The Constitution men tions a right to freedom of movement throughout the territo ry of India Every word of that clause must be given its true and legitimate meaning and in the construction of a Statute particularly a Constitution it is improper to omit any word which has a reasonable and proper place in it or to refrain from giving effect to its meaning This position is made quite clear when clause is read along with this sub clause Such restriction may be appropriate to prevent a person from going from one Province to another or one area to another having regard to local conditions prevailing in particular areas Reading article as a whole therefore it seems to me that it has no application to a legislation dealing with preventive or punitive detention as its direct object I may point out that the acceptance of the petitioner argument on the interpretation of this clause will result in the <ORG> being called upon to decide upon the reasonableness of several provisions of the Indian Penal Code and several other penal legislations as abridging this right Article gave substantive rights to citizens while article prescribed that no person can be deprived of his life and personal liberty except by procedure established by law Even so on a true construction of article it seems to me that both preventive and punitive detention are outside the scope of article In order to appreciate the true scope of article it is useful to read it by itself and then to consider how far the other articles in Part HI affect or control its meaning It gives the rights mentioned in a to to all citizens of India But clause provides that such right shall not prevent the operation of a law which relates to libel slander defamation contempt of <ORG> or any matter which offends against decency or morality or which undermines the security of or tends to overthrow the <ORG> Clause thus only emphasizes that while the individual citizen has a free right of speech or expression he cannot be permit ted to use the same to the detriment of a similar right in another citizen or to the detriment of the <ORG> Thus all laws of libel slander contempt of <ORG> or laws in respect of matters which offend against decency or morality are reaffirmed to be operative in spite of this individual right of the citizen to freedom of speech and expression Simi larly that right is also subject to laws which prevent undermining the security of the <ORG> or against activities which tend to overthrow the <ORG> A similar analysis of clauses and shows similar restrictions imposed on similar grounds In the same way clause also permits reasonable restrictions in the exercise of the right to freedom of movement throughout the territory of India the right to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India or the right to acquire hold and dispose of property being imposed by law provided such reasonable restrictions on the exercise of such right are in the inter est of the general public This is obviously to prevent an argument being advanced that while such restriction could be put in the interest of general public the Constitution did not provide for the imposi tion of such restriction to protect the interests of a smaller group of people only Reading article in that way it appears to me that the concept of the right to move freely throughout the territo ry of India is an entirely different concept from the right to personal liberty contemplated by article For instance while the right to move or reside may be covered by the expression personal liberty the right to freedom of speech men tioned in article a or the right to acquire hold or dispose of property mentioned in cannot be considered a part of the personal liberty of a citizen They form part of the liberty of a citizen but the limita tion imposed by the word personal leads me to believe that those rights are not covered by the expression personal liberty So read there is no conflict between articles and As already mentioned in respect of each of the rights specified in sub clauses of article specific limitations in respect of each is provided while the expression personal liberty in article is generally controlled by the gener al expression procedure established by law Deprivation total loss of personal liberty which inter alia includes the right to eat or sleep when one likes or to work or not to work as and when one pleases and sever al such rights sought to be protected by the expression personal liberty in article is quite different from restriction which is only a partial control of the right to move freely which is relatively a minor right of a citizen as safeguarded by article Deprivation of personal liberty has not the same meaning as restriction of free movement in the territory of India This is made clear when the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code in Chapter VIII relating to security of peace or maintenance of public order are read Therefore article cannot apply to a substantive law depriving a citizen of personal liberty I am unable to accept the contention that the word deprivation includes within its scope restriction when interpreting article Article envisages the law of preventive detention So does article read with Schedule Seven List I Entry and List III Entry Therefore when the subject of preventive detention is specifically dealt with in the Chapter on Fundamental Rights I do not think it is proper to consider a legisla tion permitting preventive detention as in conflict with the rights mentioned in article Article does not purport to cover all aspects of liberty or of personal liberty Personal liberty would primarily mean liberty of the physical body The rights given under article do not directly come under that description They are rights which accompany the freedom or liberty of the person If article is considered to be the only article safeguarding personal liberty several well recognised rights as for instance the right to eat or drink the right to work play swim and numerous other rights and activities and even the right to life will not be deemed protected under the Constitution It seems to me improper to read article as dealing with the same subject as article Article gives the rights specified therein only to the citizens of India while arti cle is applicable to all persons Moreover the protection given by article is very general The legislative restrictions on the law making powers of the legislature are not here prescribed in detail as in the case of the rights specified in article Article which is also in Part III under the caption Right to Freedom runs as follows No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law This article has been strongly relied upon by the peti tioner in support of his contention that the impugned Act is ultra vires the <ORG> as it abridges the right given by this article to every person It was argued that under the Constitution of the United States of America the corre sponding provision is found in the th and th Amendments where the provision inter alia is that no person shall be deprived of his life or liberty or property except by due process of law It was contended for the petitioner that the Indian Constitution gives the same protection to every person in India except that in the United States due process of law has been It had a wider meaning If so construed any Act passed by the <ORG> or <ORG> which was otherwise within its legislative power can destroy or abridge this right On the same line of reasoning it was argued that if that was the inten tion there was no necessity to put this as a fundamental right in Part III at all As to the meaning of the word law it was argued that it meant principles of natural justice They are An objective test i a certain definite and ascer tainable rule of human conduct for the violation of which one can be detained Notice of the grounds of such detention An impartial tribunal administrative judi cial or advisory to decide whether the detention is justi fied and Orderly course of procedure including an opportunity to be heard orally not merely by making a written representation with a right to lead evidence and call witnesses The Constitution itself provides in minute details the legislative powers of the <ORG> and <ORG> In A Constitution the same protection is given to proper ty while in India the fundamental right in respect of property is contained in article It seems unnecessary to embark on a discussion of the powers and jurisdiction of <ORG> of the A and how they came to enlarge or abridge the meaning of law in the expression due process of law Without going into details I think there is no justification to adopt the meaning of the word law as interpreted by <ORG> of A in the expression due process of law merely because the word law is used in article The discussion of the meaning of due process of law found in Willis on Constitutional Law and in <NAME> Constitutional Limitations shows the diverse meanings given to that expression at different times and under dif ferent circumstances by <ORG> of A so much so that the conclusion reached by these authors is that the expression Moreover to control the meaning so given to that expression from time to time the doctrine of police powers was brought into play Our attention was drawn to the debates and report of the drafting committee of <ORG> in respect of the wording of this clause Resort may be had to these sources with great caution and only when latent ambiguities are to be resolved A perusal of the report of the drafting committee to which our attention was drawn shows clearly that <ORG> had before it the American article and the expression due process of law but they deliberately dropped the use of that expression from our Constitution Normally read and without thinking of other Constitutions the expression procedure established by law must mean procedure prescribed by the law of the State If the Indian Constitution wanted to preserve to every person the protection given by the due process clause of the Ameri can Constitution there was nothing to prevent the <ORG> from adopting the phrase or if they wanted to limit the same to procedure only to adopt that expression with only the word procedural prefixed to law However the correct question is what is the right given by article The only right is that no person shall be deprived of his life or liberty except according to procedure established by law This is particularly so when in omitting to adopt due process of law it was considered that the expression procedure established by law made the standard specific The word law as used in this Part has different shades of meaning but in no other article it appears to bear the indefinite meaning of natural justice If so there appears no reason why in this article it should receive this peculiar meaning Article which is also in Part III and relates to the fundamental rights in respect of property runs as follows No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law The object of dealing with property under a differ ent article appears more to provide the exceptions found in article to rather than to give the word law a different meaning than the one given in article There is therefore no justification to give the meaning of jus to law in article But other articles of that Constitution which expressly pre serve other personal liberties in different clauses have to be read together to determine the meaning of law in the expression procedure established by law By adopting the phrase procedure established by law the Constitution gave the legislature the final word to determine the law Under article it is provided that the liberty of the person is inviolable and no person shall be deprived of such except in accord ance with law In article it is provided that no one shall be tried save in due course of law and extraor dinary Courts were not permitted to be established except <ORG> to try military offences <ORG> gave the expression due course of law the meaning given to it according to the English law and not the American law It was observed by Lord <NAME> in <NAME> Officer Administering the Government of Nigeria that in accordance with British Jurispru dence no member of the executive can interfere with the liberty or property of a British subject except when he can support the legality of his act before <ORG> A detailed discussion of the true limits of article will not be necessary if article is considered a code to the extent there are provisions therein for preventive detention connection it may be noticed that the articles in Part III deal with different and separate rights It is obvious that article and prescribe limita tions on the right given by article No person who is arrested shall be detained in custody without being informed as soon as may be of the grounds for such arrest nor shall he be denied the right to consult and to be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice Every person who is arrested and detained in custo dy shall be produced before the nearest magistrate within a period of twenty four hours of such arrest excluding the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to <ORG> and no such person shall be detained in custody beyond the said period without the authority of a magistrate to any person who is arrested or detained under any law providing for preventive detention No law providing for preventive detention shall authorize the detention of a person for a longer period than three months unless a <ORG> consisting of persons who are or have been or are qualified to be appointed as Judges of <ORG> has reported before the expiration of the said period of three months that there is in its opinion suffi cient cause for such detention Provided that nothing in this sub clause shall authorise the detention of any person beyond the maximum period prescribed by any law made by <ORG> under sub clause of clause or such person is detained in accordance with the provisions of any law made by <ORG> under subclauses a and of clause When any person is detained in pursuance of an order made under any law providing for preventive detention the authority making the order shall as soon as may be communicate to such person the grounds on which the order has been made and shall afford him the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order Nothing in clause shall require the authority making any such order as is referred to in that clause to disclose facts which such authority considers to be against the public interest to disclose Parliament may by law prescribe a the circumstances under which and the class or classes of cases in which a person may be detained for a period longer than three months under any law providing for preventive detention without obtaining the opinion of <ORG> in accordance with the provisions of sub clause a of clause the maximum period for which any person may in any class or classes of cases be detained under any law provid ing for preventive detention and the procedure to be followed by <ORG> in an inquiry under sub clause a of clause It is obvious that in respect of arrest and detention article and provide safeguards Reading in that way the proper mode of construc tion will be that to the extent the procedure is prescribed by article the same is to be observed otherwise article will apply But if certain procedural safeguards are expressly stated as not required or specific rules on certain points of procedure are prescribed it seems im proper to interpret these points as not covered by article and left open for consideration under article To the extent the points are dealt with and included or excluded article is a complete code It may be noticed that neither the American nor the Japanese Constitution contain provisions permitting preventive detention The provisions of article to by their very wording leave unaffected the large powers of legislation on this point and emphasize particularly by article the power of the <ORG> to deprive a person of a right to have his case considered by an advisory board article in particular are the only restrictions on that power and but for those provisions the power to legislate on this subject would have been quite unrestricted Parliament could have made a law without any safeguard or any procedure for preventive detention a provision establishing an advisory board consisting of persons with the qualifications mentioned in sub clause a and which has to report before the expira tion of three months if in its opinion there was sufficient cause for such detention The proviso to this clause further enjoins that even though the advisory board may be of the opinion that there was sufficient cause for such detention i detention beyond the period of three months still the detention is not to be permitted beyond the maximum period if any prescribed by <ORG> under article Inasmuch as the im pugned Act is an Act of the <ORG> purported to be so made clause has no operation and may for the present discussion be kept aside Article prescribes that when any person under a preventive detention law is detained the authority making the order shall as soon as may be commu nicate to such person the grounds on which the order has been made and shall afford him the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order Article permits the authority making the order to withhold disclosure of facts which such authority consid ers against the public interest to disclose It may be noticed that this clause only permits the non disclosure of facts and reading clauses and together a distinc tion is drawn between facts and grounds of detention The Constitution is silent as to the person to whom it has to be made or how it has to be dealt with It does not therefore mean that if a law made by the <ORG> in respect of preventive detention does not make provision on those two points it is invalid Silence on these points does not make the impugned Act in contravention of the Constitution because the first question is what are the rights given by the Constitution in the case of preventive detention board is a fundamental right violated by the procedure prescribed in the Act passed by the <ORG> The important clause to be considered is article It was argued that this gives the <ORG> a right to allow a person to be detained indefinitely Bearing in mind the provisions of article read with article and Schedule VII List I Entry and List III Entry it is thus clear that the <ORG> is empowered to enact a law of preventive detention a for reasons connected with defence for reasons connected with foreign affairs for reasons connected with the security of India and under List III for reasons connected with the security of a State for reasons connected with the maintenance of public order or for reasons connect ed with the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community Counsel for the petitioner has challenged the validity of several provisions of the Act observed that a Constitution must not be construed in any narrow and pedantic sense Mr Justice <NAME> in Attorney General of New South Wales <ORG> observed Although we are to interpret words of the Constitution on the same principles of interpretation as we apply to any ordinary law these very principles of interpretation compel us to take into account the nature and scope of the Act that we are interpreting to remember that it is a Constitution a mechanism under which laws are to be made and not a mere Act which declares what the law is to be I conceive that a broad and liberal spirit should inspire those whose duty it is to interpret it but I do not imply by this that they are free to stretch or pervert the lan guage of the enactment in the interest of any legal or con stitutional theory or even for the purpose of supplying omissions or of correcting supposed errors There is considerable authority for the statement that the <ORG> are not at liberty to declare an Act void because in their opinion it is opposed to a spirit supposed to pervade the Constitution but not expressed in words Where the funda mental law has not limited either in terms or by necessary implication the general powers conferred upon the Legisla ture we cannot declare a limitation under the notion of hav ing discovered something in the spirit of the Constitution which is not even mentioned in the instrument It is diffi cult upon any general principles to limit the omnipotence of the sovereign legislative power by judicial interposition except so far as the express words of a written Constitution give that authority It is also stated if the words be positive and without ambiguity there is no authority for a <ORG> to vacate or repeal a Statute on that ground alone But it is only in express constitutional provisions limiting legislative power and controlling the temporary will of a majority by a permanent and Com It was first argued that by section the <ORG> had delegated its legislative power to the executive officer in detaining a person on his being satisfied of its necessi ty Section of the impugned Act is no delegation of legislative power to make laws It only confers discretion on the officer to enforce the law made by the legislature Before a person can be held liable for an offence it is obvious that he should be in a position to know what he may do or not do and an omission to do or not to do will result in the State A It was also contended that section prescribes no limit of time for detention and therefore the legislation is ultra vires A perusal of the provisions of the impugned Act moreover shows that in section provision is made for detention for a period longer than three months but not exceeding one year in respect of clauses a and of that section It appears therefore that in respect of the rest of the clauses mentioned in section a the detention is not contem plated to be for a period longer than three months and in such cases a reference to the advisory board under section is contemplated It was argued that this gave only the right of making a representation without being heard orally or without affording an opportu nity to lead evidence and therefore was not an orderly course of procedure as required by the rules of natural justice The <ORG> by the Act has expressly given a right to the person detained under a preventive detention order to receive the grounds for detention and also has given him a right to make a representation The Act has thus complied with the requirements of article That clause which prescribes what procedure has to be followed as a matter of fundamental right is silent about the person detained having a right to be heard orally or by a lawyer The <ORG> having dealt with the requirements of receiving grounds and giving an opportunity to make a representation has deliberately refrained from providing a right to be heard orally If so I do not read the clause as guarantee ing such right under article New forms of procedure are as much held even by <ORG> due process of law as old forms provided they give a person a fair opportunity to present his case It was contended that the right to make a representation in article must carry with it a right to be heard by an independent tribunal otherwise the making of a representation has no substance because it is not an effective remedy article as giving a fundamental right to be heard by an independent tribunal To consider the right to make a representation as necessarily including a right to be heard by an independent judicial administrative or advisory tribunal will thus be directly in conflict with the express words of article The right to make a defence may be admitted but there is nothing to support the contention that an oral interview is compulsory In <ORG> <NAME> the respondent applied to the <ORG> constituted under the Housing Act to state a special case for the opinion of <ORG> contending that the order was invalid because the report of the Inspector had been treated as a confi dential document and had not been disclosed to the respond ent and because the <ORG> had declined to give the respondent an opportunity of being heard orally by the person or persons by whom the appeal was finally decided Both the points were urged before <ORG> on appeal In the case of a Court of law tradition in this country has prescribed certain principles to which in the main the procedure must conform But what that procedure is to be in detail must depend on the nature of a tribunal a decision was come to What appears to me to have been the fallacy of the judgment of the majority in <ORG> is that it begs the question at the begin ning by setting up the test of the procedure of <ORG> instead of the other standard which was laid down for such cases in <ORG> <NAME> I do not think the Board was bound to hear the respondent orally provided it gave him the opportunities he actually had In spite of the fact that in England the <ORG> is supreme I am unable to accept the view that the <ORG> in making laws legislates against the well recognised principles of natural justice accepted as such in all civilized countries A right to lead evidence against facts suspected to exist is also not essential in the case of preventive deten tion That is one of the clauses of the Constitution dealing with fundamental rights If even the non disclosure of facts is permitted I fail to see how there can exist a right to contest facts by evidence and the noninclusion of such procedural right could make this Act invalid Section was challenged on the ground that it excludes the right to appear in person or by any lawyer before the advisory board and it was argued that this was an infringement of a fundamental right It must be noticed that article which gives a detained person a right to consult or be defended by his own legal practitioner is specifically excluded by article in the case of legislation dealing with preventive detention the <ORG> is expressly given power under article to lay down the procedure in an inquiry by an advisory board In my opinion the answer is in the provision found in article of the Constitution of India In my opinion this argument has nos substance because the Act has to be read as a whole Section of the impugned Act is challenged on the ground that it does not conform to the provisions of article It is argued that article permits preventive detention beyond three months when the <ORG> pre scribes the circumstances in which and the class or class es of cases in which a person may be detained In my opinion this argument is unsound because the words used in article themselves are against such interpretation It was next contended that by section the <ORG> had provided that a person might be detained for a period longer than three months but not exceeding one year from the date of his detention without obtaining the opinion of an advisory board with a view to prevent him from acting in any manner prejudicial to a the defence of India rela tions of India with foreign powers or the security of India or the security of a <ORG> or the maintenance of public order The argument advanced on behalf of the petitioner on this point does not appeal to me because it assumes that the words of Schedule VII List I Entry and List III Entry are never capable of being considered as circum stances or classes of cases In my opinion that assumption is not justified particularly when we have to take into consideration cases of preventive detention and not of conviction and punitive detention Each of the expressions used in those entries is capable of complying with the requirement of mentioning circumstances or classes of cases The classification of cases having regard to an object may itself amount to a description of the circumstances If so there appears no reason why the same expression when used in section a and of the impugned Act should not be held to have such specific meaning and thus comply with the requirement of prescribing circumstances or classes of cases Section was attacked on the ground that even if a detention order was revoked another detention order under section might be made against the same person on the same grounds There is nothing in the Chapter on Fundamental Rights and in article or to prevent the inclusion of such a clause in a parliamentary legislation permitting preventive detention As regards an opportunity to be heard there is no absolute natural right recognised in respect of oral representation It has been held to depend on the nature of the tribunal The right to make a representation is affirmed by the Constitution in article and finds a place in the impugned Act The right to an orderly course of procedure to the extent it is guaranteed by article read with article and by article a and has also been thus provided in the Act It seems to me therefore that the petitioner contentions even on these points fail Section was strongly attacked on the ground that it violated all principles of natural justice and even in fringed the right given by article of the Constitu tion No <ORG> shall except for the purposes of a prosecution for an offence punishable under subsection allow any statement to be made or any evidence to be given before it of the substance of any communication made under section of the grounds on which a detention order has been made against any person or of any representation made by him against such order and notwithstanding anything contained in any other law no <ORG> shall be entitled to require any public officer to produce before it or to disclose the substance of any such communication or representation made or the proceedings of <ORG> or that part of the report of <ORG> which is confidential It shall be an offence punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year or with fine or with both for any person to disclose or publish without the previous authorisation of <ORG> or <ORG> as the case may be any contents or matter purporting to be contents of any such communication or representation as is referred to in sub section Provided that nothing in this sub section shall apply to a disclosure made to his legal adviser by a person who is the subject of a detention order held that the <ORG> can examine the grounds given by the <ORG> to see if they are relevant to the object which the legislation has in view The learned Attorney General urged that the whole object of the section was to prevent ventilation in public of the grounds and the representations and that it was a rule of evidence only which the <ORG> could prescribe The <ORG> has the right under article not to disclose facts which it considers undesirable to disclose in the public interest It does not permit the <ORG> to refrain from disclosing grounds which fall under clause Moreover the position is made clear by the words of article It provides that the detaining authority shall communicate to such detained person the grounds on which the order has been made To urge this argument the aggrieved party must have a right to intimate to the <ORG> the grounds given for the alleged detention and the representation made by him If the detained person is not in a position to put before the <ORG> this paper the <ORG> will be prevented from considering whether the requirements of article are complied with and that is a right which is guaranteed to every person It seems to me therefore that the provisions Therefore the decision that section is ultra vires does not affect the validity of the rest of the Act <NAME> question to be decided in this case is whether the Preventive Detention Act Act IV of is wholly or in part invalid and whether the peti tioner who has been detained under that Act is entitled to a writ in the nature of habeas corpus on the ground that his detention is illegal The question being a pure question of law can he decided without referring to a long chain of facts which are narrated in the petitioner application to this Court and which have a more direct bearing on the alleged mala fides of the authorities who have detained him than on the validity of the Act things done or omit ted to be done before that date Section a provides that the Central Government or <ORG> may a if satisfied with respect to any person that with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to i the defence of India the relations of India with foreign powers or the security of India or ii the security of the <ORG> or the maintenance of public order or iii the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community or if satisfied with respect to any person who is a foreigner within the meaning of the Foreigners Act XXXI of that with a view to regulating his continued presence in India or with a view to making arrangements for his expulsion from India it is necessary so to do make an order directing that such person be detained Sub sections and of this section empower a District Magistrate Sub Divisional Magistrate or the Com missioner of Police in a Presidency Town to exercise the power conferred by and make the order contemplated in sub section but with the qualification that any order made thereunder must be reported forthwith to the <ORG> of the State to which the Section of the Act provides that the authority making an order of detention shall as soon as may be communicate to the person detained the grounds on which the order has been made and shall afford him the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order in a case where such order has been made by <ORG> to that <ORG> and in a case where it has been made by a State <ORG> or an officer subor dinate thereto to the State <ORG> Section pro vides that when a detention order has been made with a view to preventing a person from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community or if it is made in regard to a person who is a foreigner within the meaning of the Foreigners Act with a view to regulating his continued presence in India or making arrangements for his expulsion from India the grounds on which the order has been made and the representation if any Section lays down the procedure to be followed by the advisory board and section provides that in any case where the advisory board has reported that there is sufficient cause for the detention of the person concerned the detention order may be confirmed and the detention of the person concerned may be continued for such period as <ORG> or <ORG> as the case may be thinks fit which is a very important section as we shall presently see runs as follows Any person detained in any of the following classes of cases or under any of the following circumstances may be detained without obtaining the opinion of <ORG> for a period longer than three months but not exceed ing one year from the date of his detention namely where such person has been detained with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to a the defence of India relations of India with foreign powers or the security of India or the security of a <ORG> or the maintenance of public order The case of every person detained under a detention order to which the provisions of sub section apply shall within a period of six months from the date of his detention be reviewed where the order was made by the Central Government or a State Government by such Govern ment and where the order was made by any officer specified in sub section of section by <ORG> to which such officer is subordinate in consultation with a person who is or has been or is qualified to be appointed as Judge of <ORG> nominated in that behalf by <ORG> or <ORG> as the case may be Section which is also a material section for the purpose of this case is to the following effect No <ORG> shall except for the purposes of a prosecution for an offence punishable under subsection allow any statement to be made or any evidence to be given before it of the substance of any communication made under section of the grounds on which a detention order has been made against any person or of any representation made by him against such order and not withstanding anything contained in any other law no <ORG> shall be entitled to require any public officer to produce before it or to disclose the substance of any such commu nication or representation made or the proceedings of <ORG> or that part of the report of <ORG> which is confidential It shall be an offence punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year or with fine or with both for any person to disclose or publish without the previous authorisation of <ORG> or <ORG> as the case may be any contents or matter purporting to be the contents of any such communication or representation as is referred to in sub section Provided that nothing in this sub section shall apply to a disclosure made to his legal adviser by a person who is the subject of a detention order The point which has been pressed before us is that the Act is invalid as it takes away or abridges certain funda mental rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution of India and in support of this general proposition reliance is placed on article which runs as follows The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this Part and any law made in contravention of this clause shall to the extent of the contravention be void The rights guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution are classified under seven broad heads as follows Right to equality Right to freedom Right against exploitation Right to freedom of religion Cultural and educational rights Right to property and Right to constitutional remedies Article is divided into seven sub clauses and runs as follows All citizens shall have the right a to freedom of speech and expression to assemble peaceably and without arms to form associations or unions to move freely throughout the territory of India to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India to acquire hold and dispose of property and to practise any profession or to carry on any occupation trade or business Clauses and of this article pro vide that nothing in clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in regard to the rights under that clause under certain conditions which are mentioned there in Clause with which we are directly concerned and which will serve as a specimen to show the nature of these provisions is to the following effect Nothing in sub clauses and of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposes or prevent the State from making any law imposing reasonable restrictions on the exercise of any of the rights conferred by the said sub clauses either in the interests of the general public or for the protection of the interests of any Scheduled Tribe The contentions advanced on behalf of the petitioner with reference to this article are that the Act under which he has been detained deprives him who is a citizen of the Republic of India of the right to move freely throughout the territory of India which is guaran teed under article and that under clause of article it is open to this Court to judge whether the restrictions imposed by the Act on the exercise of the right conferred by article are reasonable or otherwise Before dealing with this argument it is necessary to understand the meaning of the words used in article and to have a clear compre hension as to the true nature of the right conferred there under The contention put forward on behalf of the peti tioner is that freedom of movement is the essence of person al liberty and any restraint on freedom of movement must be held to amount to abridgment or deprivation of personal liberty as the case may be according to the nature of the restraint After very careful consideration I have come to the conclusion that this contention is well founded in law <NAME> in his Commentaries on the Laws of England th Edition volume page states that personal liberty consists in the power of locomotion of changing But the fact that he controls its movements for ever so short a time is an offence against the King peace for no one has the right to molest another in his free movements Dealing with the offence of wrongful confinement the same learned author observes as follows at page of his book Wrongful confinement is a species of wrongful restraint as defined in the last section In wrongful restraint there is only a partial suspension of one liberty of locomotion while in wrongful confinement there is a total suspension of liberty beyond certain circum scribing limits A similar opinion has been expressed by several authors including Sir <NAME> in his book entitled Freedom under the Law But it is contended on behalf of the <ORG> that freedom of move ment to which reference has been made in article is not the freedom of movement to which <NAME> and other authors have referred but is a different species of freedom which is qualified by the words throughout the territory of India How the use of the expression throughout the territory of India can qualify the meaning of the rest of the words used in the article is a matter beyond my compre hension Throughout is an amplifying and not a limiting expression and I am sur prised to find that the expression throughout the territory of India which was used to give the widest possible scope to the freedom of movement is sought to be construed as an expression limiting the scope and nature of the freedom In my opinion the words throughout the territory of India having regard to the context in which they have been used here have the same force and meaning as the expression to whatsoever place one own inclination may direct used by <NAME> or the expression freedom to be able to go whithersoever one pleases used by <NAME> in <NAME> <NAME> The question as to whether preventive detention is an encroachment on the right guaranteed by article has been considered by the Nagpur Patna and Calcutta <ORG> been ultimately adopted by these <ORG> is that preventive detention is not a violation of the right guaranteed by article but in the Calcutta who have held the contrary view appears to be the same Having regard to the fact that the view expressed by so many learned Judges is opposed to the view I am inclined to take I consider it necessary to deal briefly with the main objections which have been raised in support of the narrow meaning sought to be attached to the words in article I It will be recalled that clause of article which I have already quoted in full provides among other things that nothing in clause shall affect the operation of any law present or future imposing reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right of freedom of movement either in the interests of the general public or for the protection of the interests of any Scheduled Tribe It has been argued that the use of the words interests of any Scheduled Tribe in this clause shows that the right guaranteed by article is a limited right of movement such as the right to visit different localities and to go from one place to another and is different from the expression freedom of movement which has been stated by <ORG> to be another name for personal liberty It is pointed out that the restrictions in contemplation here are mainly restrictions preventing undesirable outsiders from visiting Scheduled Areas and exploiting Scheduled Tribes and if the words freedom of movement had been used in the larger sense such a small matter would not have found a place in clause of article I must frankly confess that I am unable to appreciate this argument and to hold that a mere reference to Scheduled Tribes affects the plain meaning of the words used in clause of article The words used in article are very wide and mean that a person can go at his will in any direction to any locality and to any distance The framers of the Constitution wanted to save all restrictive legislation affecting freedom of movement made in the interests of the general public which expression means the same thing as public interests and I think that the law in regard to preventive detention is fully covered by the expression restrictions imposed in the public interests But they also remembered that there were restrictive laws made in the interests of an important community and that similar laws may have to be made in future and hence they added the words for the protection of the interests of any Scheduled Tribe It may at first sight appear to be a relatively small matter but in their anxiety to cover the whole field of restrictive laws made whether in the public interest or in the interests of a particular community and not to leave the smallest loophole the framers of the Constitution apparently decided to draft the clause in the present form As far as I am aware there are no restrictive laws made in the interests of any commu nity other than the scheduled tribes and I think clause is sufficiently comprehensive to include the smallest as well as the most complete restrictions on freedom of move ment I am also satisfied that the mere mention of sched uled tribes in clause cannot change the plain meaning of the words of the main provision which we find in article and confine it to some kind of peculiar and truncated freedom of movement which is unconnected with personal liberty and which is unknown to any Constitution with which This ordinance provides for the apprehension and detention in custody of any person whom the authority empowered by the rules to appre hend or detain as the case may be suspects on grounds appearing to such authority to be reasonable of being of hostile origin or of having acted acting being about to act or being likely to act in a manner prejudicial to the public safety or interest the defence of British India the maintenance of public order His Majesty relations with foreign powers or Indian States the maintenance of peaceful conditions in tribal areas or the efficient prosecution of the war or with respect to whom such authority is satisfied that his apprehension and detention are necessary for the purpose of preventing him from acting in any such prejudi cial manner the prohibition of such person from entering or residing or remaining in any area and the compelling of such person to reside and remain in any area or to do or abstain from doing anything The points to be noted in connection with the ordinance are that it is an ordinance specifically providing for apprehension and detention that notwithstanding the fact that there is a gener al reference in it to acts prejudicial to public safety or interests and maintenance of public order there is also a specific reference to maintenance of peaceful conditions in tribal areas that tribal areas and scheduled tribes are kindred subjects as would appear from the Fifth Schedule appended to the Constitution and that maintenance of peaceful conditions in tribal areas may be as much in the public interest as in the inter ests of persons living in those areas This ordinance shows at least this much that sometimes the law of preventive detention can also be made in the interests of scheduled tribes or scheduled areas and conse quently the mere mention of scheduled tribes in clause does not necessarily exclude laws relating to preventive detention from the scope of article The same remarks apply to the ordinance called The Restriction and Detention Ordinance Ordinance No III of which empow ered the Central Government or <ORG> to detain and make orders restricting the movements of certain persons in the interest of public safety maintenance of public order as well as maintenance of peaceful conditions in tribal areas etc It is also argued that since preventive detention amounts to a total deprivation of freedom of movement it is not a violation of the right granted under article in regard to which the word restriction and not deprivation has been used in clause This argument also does not appeal to me There are really two questions which fall to be decided in this case viz a Does pre ventive detention take away the right guaranteed by article and if so what are the consequences if any It seems obvious to me that preventive detention amounts to a complete deprivation of the right guaranteed by article In my opinion having regard to the context in which the word restriction has been used there is no antithesis between that word and the word depriva tion As I have already stated restraint on the right to move can assume a variety of forms and restriction would be the most appropriate expression to be used in clause so as to cover all those forms ranging from total to various kinds of partial deprivation freedom of movement It appears that some of the Judges who had to deal with the question which we have before us were greatly influenced by the argument that if the deprivation of per sonal liberty amounts to deprivation of the right granted under article any conviction for an offence under the Indian Penal Code involving a sentence of impris onment will be subject to judicial review on the ground of reasonableness of the provisions of the Code under which the conviction is recorded It would mean that every law under which a person may be imprisoned including all the provisions of the Penal Code is open to examination by the <ORG> on the ground of reasonableness It makes the <ORG> supreme arbiters in regard to any such legislation and they can reject it or accept it in accordance with their ideas of whether it appeals to their reason It is difficult to believe the framers of the Constitution ever intended to place so enormous a power in the hands of the <ORG> <NAME> The State of Biharl The obvious and strictly legal reply to this argument is that the consideration which has so greatly weighed with the learned Chief Justice is not enough to cut down the plain meaning of the general words used in article of the Constitution As has been pointed out in a number of cases in construing enacted words we are not concerned with the policy involved or with the results injurious or otherwise which may follow by giving effect to the language used King Emperor <NAME> and others I Apart from this aspect of the matter I agree with one of the learned Judges Of <ORG> in his remark that no calamitous or untoward result will follow even if the provisions of the Penal Code become justiciable It seems to me that this Court should not be deterred from giving effect to a fundamental right granted under the Constitution merely because of a vague and unfounded fear that something catas trophic may happen Section of the Indian Penal Code provides that every person shall be liable to punishment under this Code and not otherwise for every act or omission contrary to the provisions there of of which he shall be guilty within British India The Indian Penal Code does not primarily or necessarily impose restrictions on the freedom of movement and it is not correct to say that it is a law imposing restrictions on the right to move freely The punishment may consist in imprisonment or a pecuniary penalty If it consists in a pecuniary penalty it obviously involves no restriction on movement but if it consists in imprisonment there is a restriction on movement This restraint is imposed not under a law imposing restrictions on movement but under a law defining crime and making it punishable The punishment is correlated directly with the violation of some other person right and not with the right of at In my opinion therefore the Indian Penal Code does not come within the ambit of the words law imposing restriction on the right to move freely A person is punitively detained only after a trial for committing a crime and after his guilt has been established in a compe tent Court of justice A person so convicted can take his case to <ORG> and sometimes bring it to this Court also and he can in the course of the proceedings connected with his trial take all pleas available to him including the plea of want of jurisdiction of <ORG> and the invalidity of the law under which he has been prosecuted The final judgment in the criminal trial will thus constitute a serious obstacle in his way if he chooses to assert even after his conviction that his right under article has been violated But a person who is preventively detained has not to face such an obstacle whatever other obstacle may be in his way It was pointed out that article being confined to citizens the anomalous situation will follow that in cases of preventive detention a citizen will be placed in a better position than a non citizen because if a citizen is detained his detention will be open to some kind of judicial review under article but if a non citizen has been detained his case will not be open to such review It is equally clear that restric tions on those rights are to a limited extent at least open to judicial review The very same question which is raised in regard to article will arise with regard to most of the other sub clauses A citizen has the right to assemble peaceably and without arms to form associations or unions and so on If there is any law imposing unreason able restrictions on any of these rights that law will not be good law so far as citizens are concerned but it may be good law so far as non citizens are concerned If a citizen has been granted certain other additional protections under article there is no anomaly involved in the discrimination It was contended that the rights declared by article are the rights of a free citizen and if he has already been deprived of his liberty in the circumstances referred to in articles and then it would be idle to say that he still enjoys the right referred to in article After giving my fullest consideration to this argument I have not been able to appreciate how it arises in this case There is nothing in article go suggest that it applies only to those cases which do not fall under articles and Why can he say to those who detained him As a citizen I have the right to move freely and you cannot curtail or take away my right beyond the limits imposed by clause of article This is the only question which arises in the case and it should not be obscured by any abstruse or metaphysical considerations It is true that if you put a man under detention he cannot move and therefore he is not in a position to exercise the right guaranteed under article If he has been detained under some provision of law imposing restrictions on the freedom of movement then the question will arise whether the restrictions are reasonable If he has been detained under no provision of law or under some law which is invalid he must be set at liberty To my mind the scheme of the Chapter dealing with the fundamental rights does not contemplate what is attributed to it namely that each article is a code by itself and is independent of the others The case of a person who is convicted of an offence will come under articles and and also under article so far as his arrest and detention in custody before trial are concerned Preventive detention which is dealt with in article also amounts to deprivation of personal liberty which is referred to in article and is a violation of the right of freedom of movement dealt with in article That there are other instances of overlapping of articles in the Constitution may be illus trated by reference to article and article both of which deal with the right to property and to some extent overlap each other It appears that some learned <ORG> Judges who had to deal with the very question before us were greatly impressed by the statement in the report of <ORG> on article corresponding to the present article that the word liberty should be qualified by the insertion of the word personal before it for otherwise it may be construed very widely so as to include the freedoms dealt with in article corresponding to the present article I am not however prepared to hold that this statement is decisive on the question of the construction of the words used in article which are quite plain and can be construed without any extraneous help Whether the report of the Drafting Commit tee and the debates on the floor of the <ORG> should be used at all in construing the words of a statute which are words of ordinary and common use and are not used in any technical or peculiar sense is a debatable question and whether they can be used in aid of a construction which is a strain upon the language used in the clause to be interpreted is a still more doubtful matter But apart from these legal consider ations it is I think open to us to analyse the statement and see whether it goes beyond adding a somewhat plausible reason a superficially plausible reason for a slight verbal change in article It seems clear that the addi tion of the word personal before liberty in article cannot change the meaning of the words used in article nor can it put a matter which is inseparably bound up with personal liberty beyond its place Personal liberty and personal freedom in spite of the use of the word personal are as we find in several books sometimes used in a wide sense and embrace freedom of speech freedom of A general statement by <ORG> referring to freedom in plural cannot take the place of an authoritative exposition of the meaning of the words used in article which has not been specifically referred to and cannot be such an overriding consideration as to compel us to put a meaning opposed to reason and authority The words used in article must be construed as they stand and we have to decide upon the words themselves whether in the But as I shall point out later however literally we may construe the words used in article and however restricted may be the meaning we may attribute to those words there can be no escape from the conclusion that preventive detention is a direct infringe ment of the right guaranteed in article The expressions per sonal liberty and personal freedom have as we find in several books a wider meaning and also a narrower meaning I have shown that the juristic conception of personal liberty when these words are used in the sense of immunity from arrest is that it consists in freedom of movement and locomotion With these facts in view I have tried to find out whether there is any freedom of movement known in England apart from personal liberty used in the sense of immunity from arrest and detention but I find no trace of any such freedom Similar classifications will be found in <NAME> Introduc tion to the Study of the Law of the Constitution and <NAME> Constitutional Law and other books on constitu tional subjects but there is no reference anywhere to any freedom or right of movement in the sense in which we are asked to construe the words used in article In the Constitutions of America Ireland and many other countries where freedom is prized there is no reference to freedom or right of movement as something distinct from personal liberty used in the sense of immunity from arrest and confinement It is only in the Constitution of the Free City of Danzig which covers an area of square miles that we find these words in article All nationals shall enjoy freedom of movement within the City There is however no authoritative opinion available to support the view that this freedom is anything different from what is otherwise called personal liberty Such being the general position I am confirmed in my view that the juristic conception that personal liberty and freedom of movement connote the same thing is the correct and true conception and the words used in article must be construed according to this universally accepted legal conception Lord <NAME> in refer ring to this regulation said in <NAME> Sir <NAME> that the regulation undisputedly gave to a Secretary of <ORG> unrestricted power to detain a suspected person The matter ultimately came up before <ORG> in <NAME> <NAME> and the noble Lords in dealing with the case proceeded on the assumption that there was no difference between internment and incarceration or imprisonment His person was seized he has been interned The appellant lost his liberty and was interned He then proceeded to state that there was no difference between internment and imprisonment and quoted the following passage from <NAME> The confinement of the person in any wise is an imprisonment Proceeding on this footing which I find to be the common basis in all other speeches delivered in the case though Lord <NAME> had given a dissenting judgment Lord <NAME> while dealing with the provisions of the regulations observed One of the most obvious means of taking precautions against dangers such as are enumerated is to impose some restriction on the freedom of movement of persons whom there may be any reason to suspect of being disposed to help the enemy Again Lord <NAME> while dealing with the merits of the case made the following observations If the legislature chooses to enact that he can be deprived of his liberty and incarcerated or interned for certain things for which he could not have been heretofore incarcerated or interned that enactment and the orders made under it if intra vires do not infringe upon the Habeas Corpus Acts or take away any right conferred by Magna Charta This passage read with the previous passage quoted by me will show that both internment and incarceration were re garded as restrictions on the freedom of movement and that deprivation of liberty and restriction on freedom of move ment were used as alternative expressions bearing the same meaning The classifica tion is important because it meets two principal arguments advanced in this case It shows firstly that detention is a form of restriction and secondly that it is a restriction on movement The classification that we find in the Defence of the Realm Regulations was with a little verbal modification adopted in the Defence of India Rules and we find that here also rule which dealt with preventive detention has been placed under the heading Restriction of movements and activities of persons In one of the Acts the same advisory board is to deal with the case of a detenue as well as that of an externed person and there are also similar provisions giving them the right to represent their case to the Government I will now assume for the sake of argument that the freedom of movement to which reference is made in article has nothing to do with personal liberty and that the words which occur in the article bear the restricted meaning attributed to them by the learned Attorney General and some of my colleagues It seems to me that even on this assump tion it is difficult to arrive at any conclusion other than what I have already arrived at We have only to ask ourselves Does a person who is detained retain even a fraction of his freedom of movement in howsoever restricted sense the term may be used and does he not lose his right to move freely from one place to another or visit any locality he likes as a necessary result of his detention I think I should refer here once more to the fact that in the Defence of the Realm Regula tions and Defence of India Rules preventive detention is classed under the heading Restriction of movements and activities Movement is here used in plural and refers to that very type of movement which is said to be protected by article moving from one State or place to another visiting different localities etc The same consideration applies to the cases of persons who are interned or externed I am however interested to find that the Patna and Bombay High Courts have held that a person who is externed can successfully assert that the right granted to him under article has been violated This view has not been seriously challenged before us and if it is correct I really do not see how it can be held that preventive deten tion is also not a direct invasion of the right guaranteed in article Perhaps one may pause here to ask what kind of laws were in contemplation of the framers of the Constitution when they referred to laws imposing re strictions in the public interest in article I think the war laws and the Provincial Act and Ordinances to which I have already referred must have been among them these being laws which expressly purport to impose restrictions on movements If so we should not overlook the fact that preventive detention was an inseparable part of these laws and was treated as a form of restriction on movement and classified as such It seems to me that when the matter is seriously considered it would be found that the interpreta tion of the learned Attorney General attracts the operation of article no less strongly and directly than the interpretation I have suggested and I prefer the latter only because I consider that it is legally unsound to treat what is inseparably bound up with and is the essential element in the legal concept of personal liberty as a wholly separate and unconnected entity It was pointed out in the course of the arguments that preventive detention not only takes away the right in article but also takes away all the other rights guaranteed by article except the right to hold acquire and dispose of property Where exactly this argu ment is intended to lead us to I cannot fully understand but it seems to me that it involves an obvious fallacy because it overlooks the difference in the modes in which preventive detention operates on the right referred to in sub clause and other sub clauses of article One who is preventively detained is straightaway deprived of his right of movement as a direct result of his detention but he loses the other rights only in consequence of his losing freedom of movement I wish only to add that when I said that I was not able to understand the full force of the argument which I have tried to deal with what I had in mind was that if preventive detention sweeps away or affects almost all the rights guaranteed in article the matter deserves very serious consideration and we cannot lightly lay down that article does not come into operation Being fully alive to the fact that it is a serious matter to be asked to declare a law enacted by <ORG> to be unconstitutional I have again and again asked myself the question What are we to put in the scales against the construction which I am inclined to adopt and in favour of the view that preventive detention does not take away the freedom of movement guaranteed in article The inevitable answer has always been that while in one of the scales we have plain and unambiguous language the opinion eminent jurists judicial dicta of high authority constitu tional practice in the sense that no Constitution refers to any freedom of movement apart from personal liberty and the manner in which preventive detention has been treated in the very laws on which our law on this subject is based all that we can put in the opposite scale is a vague and ill rounded apprehension that some fearful object such as the revision of the Penal Code is looming obscurely in the distant horizon the peculiar objection that the mere men tion of the scheduled tribes will alter the meaning of certain plain words the highly technical and unreal dis tinction between restriction and deprivation and the assump tion not warranted by any express provision that a person who is preventively detained cannot claim the right of freedom of movement because he is not a free man and certain other things which whether taken singly or collectively are too unsubstantial to carry any weight In these circum stances I am strongly of the view that article guarantees the right of freedom of movement in its widest sense that freedom of movement being the essence of person al liberty the right guaranteed under the article is really a right to personal liberty and that preventive detention is a deprivation of that right I am also of the view that even on the interpretation suggested by the learned Attor ney General preventive detention cannot but be held to be a violation of the right conferred by article The scope of the review is simply to see whether any particular law imposes any unreasonable restrictions Considering that the restrictions are imposed on a most valuable right there is nothing revolutionary in the legislature trusting <ORG> to examine whether an Act which infringes upon that right is within the limits of reason I will now pass on to the consideration of article which runs as follows No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law The only words which cause some difficulty in the proper construction of the article are procedure established by law The learned Attorney General contended before us that the word law which is used in article means State made law or law enacted by the State On the other hand the learned counsel for the petitioner strongly contended that the expression procedure established by law is used in a much wider sense and approximates in meaning to the expres sion due process of law as interpreted by <ORG> in the earliest times and if that is so it means exactly what some of the American writers mean to convey by the expression procedural due process In the course of the arguments the learned Attorney General referred us to the proceedings in <ORG> for the purpose of showing that the article as originally drafted contained the words without due process of law but these words were subsequently replaced by the words except according to procedure established by law In my opinion though the proceedings or discussions in the <ORG> are not relevant for the purpose of construing the meaning of the expressions used in article especially when they are plain and unambiguous they are relevant to show that the <ORG> intended to avoid the use of the expression without due process of law In the reign of Edward III however the words due process of law were used in a statute guaranteeing that no person will be de prived of his property or imprisoned or indicted or put to death without being brought in to answer by due process of law Edward III Ch III The expression was used in such a wide sense that the judges found it difficult to define it and in one of the cases it was ob served as follows It would be difficult and perhaps impossible to give to those words a definition at once accurate and broad enough to cover every case It seems plain that <ORG> did not adopt this expression on account of the very elastic meaning given to it but preferred to use the words according to procedure established by law which occur in the Japanese Constitution framed in It will not be out of place to state here in a few words how the Japanese Constitution came into existence Subsequently the Chief of this Section and the staff drafted the Constitution with the help of American constitu tional lawyers who were called to assist <ORG> in the task Now there are two matters which deserve to be noticed that the Japanese Constitution was framed wholly under American influence and that at the time it was framed the trend of judicial opinion in America was in favour of confining the meaning of the expression due process of law to what is expressed by certain American writers by the somewhat quaint but useful expression proce dural due process That there was such a trend would be clear from the following passage which I quote from <NAME> The Growth of Constitutional Power in the United States page During the first period covering roughly the first century of government under the Constitution due process was interpreted principally as a restriction upon procedure and largely the judicial procedure by which the government exercised its powers In the circumstances mentioned it seems permissible to surmise that the expression procedure established by law as used in the Japanese Constitution represented the current trend of American judicial opinion with regard to due process of law and if that is so the expression as used in our Constitution means all that the American writers have read into the words procedural due process The word law may be used in an abstract or concrete sense But generally the word law has a wider meaning when used in the abstract sense without being preceded by an article Now whatever may be the meaning of the expression due process of law the word law is common to that expression as well as procedure established by law and though we are not bound to adopt the construction put on law or due process of law in America yet since a number of eminent American Judges have devoted much thought to the subject I am not prepared to hold that we can derive no help from their opinions and we should completely ignore them decisions of <ORG> construing the word law as used in the expression due process of law in so far as it bears on the question of legal procedure The meaning is that every citizen shall hold his life liberty and property and immunities under the protection of the general rules which govern society Dartmouth College Case It is a rule as old as the law and never more to be respected than now that no one shall be personally bound until he has had his say in <ORG> by which is meant until he has been duly cited to appear and has been afforded an opportunity to be heard The result of the numerous decisions in America has been summed up by Professor <NAME> in his book on Constitutional Law at page in the statement that the essentials of due process are no tice opportunity to be heard an impartial tribu nal and orderly course of procedure So far as orderly course of proce dure is concerned he explains that it does not require a <ORG> to strictly weigh the evidence but it does require it to examine the entire record to ascertain the issues to discover whether there are facts not reported and to see whether or not the law has been correctly applied to facts The view expressed by other writers is practically the same as that expressed by Professor <NAME> though some of them do not expressly refer to the fourth element viz Such a case can happen if the <ORG> expressly takes away the right in question in an emergency as the British <ORG> did during the last two world wars in a limited number of cases I will refer here to a few cases which show that the fundamental principle that a person whose right is affected must be heard has been observed not only in cases involving personal liberty but also in proceedings affecting other rights even though they may have come before administrative or quasi judicial tribunals <NAME> <ORG> was a case under an Act which empowered <ORG> to alter or demol ish a house where the builder had neglected to give notice of his intention <NAME> in dealing with the matter observed as follows I conceive they acted judicially because they had to determine the offence and they had to apportion the punish ment as well as the remedy That being so a long course of decisions beginning with Dr <NAME> case and ending with some very recent cases establish that although there are no positive words in a statute requiring that the party shall be heard yet the justice of the common law will supply the omission of the legislature The laws of God and man both give the party an opportunity to make his defence if he has any In the same case <NAME> observed It has been said that the principle that no man shall be deprived of his property without an opportunity of being heard is limited to a judicial proceeding I do not quite agree with that the law I think has been applied to many exercises of power which in common under standing would not be at all more a judicial proceeding than would be the act of <ORG> in ordering a house to be pulled down In the last mentioned case he observed as follows It <NAME> <NAME> contains a very valuable state ment by the Lord Chief Baron as to his view of the mode of administering justice by persons other than Judges who have judicial functions to perform which I should have been very glad to have had before me on both those club cases that I recently heard namely the case of <NAME> <NAME> and the case of <NAME> Earl of <NAME> The passage I mean is this referring to a committee They are bound in the exercise of their functions by the rule expressed in the maxim audi alteram partem that no man should be condemned to consequences without having the opportunity of making his defence This rule is not confined to the con duct of strictly legal tribunals but is applicable to every tribunal or body of persons invested with authority to adjudicate upon matters involving civil consequences to individuals Additional Powers Act which contained a provision that an appeal could in certain cases be properly determined without a hearing and that the appellate Court could dis pense with the hearing and determine the appeal summarily It was held that the meaning of rule was that the tribunal on appeal might dispense with an oral hearing not that they might dispense with a hearing of any kind and that they were bound to give the appellants a hearing in the sense of an opportunity to make out a case The Earl of Reading in delivering the judgment observed The principle of law applicable to such a case is well stated by <NAME> in <NAME> <NAME> in a passage which is cited with approval by Lord <NAME> in <NAME> <ORG> In <ORG> <NAME> <ORG> dismissed an appeal by a person against whom a closing order had been made under Housing Town Planning The principle however was conceded and lucidly set forth that when the duty of deciding an appeal is imposed those whose duty it is to decide it must act judicially and they must deal with the question referred to them without bias and must give to each of the parties an opportunity of presenting its case and that the decision must be come to in the spirit and with the sense of respon sibility of a tribunal whose duty it is to mete out justice I have particularly referred to cases which were before administrative tribunals because I have to deal in this case with preventive detention which is said to be an execu tive act and because I wish to point out that even before executive authorities and administrative tribunals an order cannot generally be passed affecting one rights without giving one such hearing as may be appropriate to the circum stances of the case adds It seems to me that there should be added to this list the following rights which appear to have become well estab lished the right of the subject to have any case affecting him tried in accordance with the principles of natural justice particularly the principles that a man may not be a judge in his own cause and that no party ought to be con demned unheard or to have a decision given against him unless he has been given a reasonable opportunity of putting forward his case Halsbury Laws of England nd Edition volume page The whole of the Criminal Procedure Code whether it deals with trial of offences or with preventive or quasiadministrative measures such as are contemplated in sections and is based upon the foundation of this principle and it is difficult to see that it has not become part of the law of the land and does not inhere in our system of law If that is so then procedure established by law must include this principle whatever else it may or may not include That the word law used in article does not mean only <ORG> made law is clear from the fact that though there is no statute laying down the complete procedure to be adopted in contempt of <ORG> cases when the contempt is not within the view of the <ORG> yet such procedure as now prevails in these cases is part of our law The statute law which regulates the procedure of trials and enquiries in criminal cases does not specifically provide for arguments in certain cases but it has always been held that no decision should be pronounced without hearing arguments In a number of cases it has been held that though there may be no specific provision for notice in the statute the provision must be read into the law I am aware that some Judges have ex pressed a strong dislike for the expression natural jus tice on the ground that it is too vague and elastic but where there are well known principles with no vagueness about them which all systems of law have respected and recognized they cannot be discarded merely because they are in the ultimate analysis found to be based on natural jus tice That the expression natural justice is not unknown to our law is apparent from the fact that <ORG> has in many criminal appeals from this country laid down that it shall exercise its power of interference with the course of criminal justice in this country when there has been a breach of principles of natural justice or departure from the requirements of justice In the present case there is no vagueness about the right claimed which is the right to have one guilt or innocence considered by an impartial body and that right must be read into the words of article In the course of his arguments the learned counsel for the petitioner repeatedly asked whether the Constitution would permit a law being enacted abolishing the mode of trial permitted by the existing law and establishing the procedure of trial by battle or trial by ordeal which was in vogue in olden times in England The question envisages something which is not likely to happen but it does raise a legal problem which can perhaps be met only in tiffs way that if the expression procedure established by law simply means any procedure established or enacted by statute it will be difficult to give a negative answer to the question but ii the word law includes what I have endeavoured to show it does such an answer may be justified It seems to me that there is nothing revolutionary in the doctrine that the words procedure established by law must include the four principles set out in Professor <NAME> book which as I have already stated are different aspects of the same principle and which have no vagueness or uncertainty about them These principles as the learned author points out and as the authorities show are not absolutely rigid principles but are adaptable to the circumstances of each case within certain limits I have only to add that it has not been seriously controverted that law in this article means valid law and procedure means certain definite rules of proceeding and not something which is a mere pretence for procedure The first point to be noted in regard to this article is that it does not exclude the operation of articles and and it must be read subject to those two articles in the same way as articles and must be read subject to article The correct position is that article must prevail in so far as there are specific provisions therein regarding preventive detention but where there are no such provisions in that article the operation of articles and cannot be excluded In my opinion the main provisions of this article are that no person can be detained beyond three months without the report of an advisory board clause a that the <ORG> may prescribe the circumstances and the class or classes of cases in which a person may be detained for more than three months without obtaining the opinion of an advisory board clause a that when a person is preventively detained the author ity making the order of detention shall communicate to such person the grounds on which the order is made and shall afford him the earliest opportunity of making a representa tion against the order clause and that the <ORG> may prescribe the maximum period for which any person may in any class or classes of cases be detained under any law providing for preventive detention clause If the first interpreta tion is correct then the function of the advisory board would be to go into the merits of the case of each person and simply report whether there was sufficient cause for his detention According to the other interpretation the function of the advisory board will be to report to the government whether there is sufficient cause for the person being detained for more than three months Since the report must be directly connected with the object for which it is required the safeguard provided by the article viz The next question which we have to discuss relates to the meaning and scope of article a which runs as follows Parliament may by law prescribe a the circumstances under which and the class or classes of cases in which a person may be detained for a period longer than three months under any law providing for preven tive detention without obtaining the opinion of <ORG> in accordance with the provisions of sub clause a of clause This question has arisen because of the way in which these ex pressions appear to have been interpreted and applied in the Act of <ORG> with which we are concerned As the matter is important and somewhat complicated I shall try to express my meaning as clearly as possible even at the risk of some repetition and in doing so I must necessarily refer to the impugned Act as well as Lists I and III of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution under which <ORG> had jurisdiction to enact it Under List III Concurrent List the appropriate item is item which shows that law as to preventive detention can be made for reasons connected with the security of the <ORG> the maintenance of public order and the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community <ORG> or <ORG> may a if satisfied with respect to any person that with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to i the defence of India the relations of India with foreign powers or the security of India or ii the security of the <ORG> or the maintenance of public order or iii the maintenance of supplies and services essen tial to the community or if satisfied with respect to any person who is a foreigner within the meaning of the Foreigners Act XXXI of that with a view to regulating his continued presence in India or with a view to making arrangements for his expulsion from India it is necessary so to do make an order directing that such person be detained These two subjects I shall refer to as and In sub clause iii reference has been made to the third matter in item of List III and I shall refer to this subject as With this classification let us now turn to the Constitution itself If the case contemplated in clause a is the rule and that contem plated in clause a is the exception then the circum stances and the class or classes of cases must be of a special or extraordinary nature so as to take the case out of the rule and bring it within the exception But this is precisely what has been done in this case All the items on which preventive legislation is possible excepting one i A to have been put within the exception and only one which relates to maintenance of supplies and services essen tial to the community has been allowed to remain under the rule The learned Attorney General maintained that it would have been open to the <ORG> to dispense with the advisory board even for the category and if such a course had been adopted it would not have affected the validity of the Act I may state here that two views are put forward before us as to how clauses a and a of article are to be read that clause a lays down the rule that in all cases where detention for more than three months is ordered it should be done in consultation with and on the report of the advisory board and clause a lays down an exception to this rule by providing that <ORG> may pass an Act permitting detention for more than three months without reference to an advisory board that clauses a and a are independent clauses making two separate and alternative provisions regarding detention for more than three months in one case on the report of an advisory board and in other case without reference to an advisory board Looking at the substance and not merely at the words I am inclined to hold that clause a practically engrafts an exception on the rule that preventive detention for more than three months can be ordered only on the report of an advisory board and so far I have proceeded on that footing But it seems to me that it will make no difference to the ulti mate conclusion whichever of the two views we may adopt Even on the latter view it must be recognized that the law which the Constitution enables the <ORG> to make under article a would be an exceptionally drastic law and on the principle that an exceptionally drastic law must be intended for an exceptional situation every word of what I have said so far must stand Clause a is only an enabling provision and it takes care to provide that the <ORG> cannot go to the extreme limit to which it is permitted to go without prescribing the class or classes cases and the circumstances to which the extreme law would be applicable It was urged that the word and which occurs between circumstances and class or classes of cases is used in a disjunctive sense and should be read as or and by way of illustration it was mentioned that when it is said that a person may do this and that it means that he is at liberty to do either this or that I think that clause a can be accurately paraphrased somewhat as follows Parliament may dispense with an advisory board but in that case it shall prescribe the circumstances and the class or classes of cases Supposing it was said that Parliament may prescribe the time and place for the doing of a thing then can it be suggested that both time and place should not be prescribed It seems obvious to me that the class or classes of cases must have some reference to the persons to be detained or to their activities and movements or to both It will mean prolonged detention i detention for a period longer than three months and deprivation of the safeguard of an advisory board Hence article a which purports to be a protective provi sion will cease to serve its object unless it is given a reasonable interpretation At first sight it seemed to me to be a plausible argument but the more I think about it the more unsound it appears to me Under the Constitution the <ORG> has to prescribe the class or classes acting within the limits of the power granted to it under Lists I and III The class or classes to be prescribed must therefore have a direct bearing on these matters and must be so selected and stated that any one by looking at them may say That is the reason why the law has prescribed prolonged detention without reference to an advisory board Under the Lists one of the subjects on which <ORG> may make a law of preventive detention is matter connected with the maintenance of public order The Act simply repeats this phraseology and states in sec tion with a view to preventing him the person to be detained from acting in a manner prejudicial to the main tenance of public order These classes are much more specific than what we find in section a of the impugned Act and therefore there is less chance of misuse by the executive of the power to order preventive detention The classes set out are these If the Secretary of <ORG> has reasonable cause to believe any person to be of hostile origin or associa tions if the Secretary of <ORG> has reasonable cause to believe any person to have been recently concerned in acts prejudicial to the public safety or the defence of the realm or in the preparation or instigation of such acts if the Secretary of <ORG> has reasonable cause to believe any person to have been or to be a member of or to have been or to be active in the furtherance of the objects of any such organization as is hereinafter mentioned a the organization is subject to foreign influence or control the persons in control of the organization have or have had associations with persons concerned in the government of or sympathies with the system of government of any Power with which His Majesty is at war and in either case there is danger of the utilization of the organization for pur poses prejudicial to the public safety etc if the Secretary of <ORG> has reasonable cause to believe that the recent conduct of any person for the time being in an area or any words recently written or spoken by such a person expressing sympathy with the enemy indicates or indicate that person is likely to assist the enemy I have only to point out that the scope within which preventive detention can be legislat ed upon in this country is much larger than the scope indi cated in the British Act under which Regulation was framed and therefore there is more scope for specification of the circumstances as well as the class or classes of cases under the impugned Act What I have stated with regard to class or classes of cases also applies to the circumstances which are also to be prescribed under article a There was some discussion at the <ORG> as to what kind of circumstances might have been specified It is not for me to answer this question but I apprehend that an impending rebellion or war serious disorder in a particular area such as has induced <ORG> to declare certain areas as disturbed areas tense communal situation prevalence of sabotage or widespread political dacoities and a variety of other matters might answer the purpose the Constitution had in view It appears to me that article deals with three classes of preventive detention preventive detention for three months preventive detention for more than three months on the report of the advisory board and preventive detention for more than three months without reference to the advisory board If one has to find some kind of a label for these class es for a clear understanding of the subject one may label them as dangerous more dangerous and most danger ous Now so far as the first two classes are concerned there is nothing to be prescribed under the Constitution Apparently the authors of the Constitution were not much concerned about class No and they thought that in so far as class No was concerned the provision that a reference to the advisory board was necessary coupled with the provision that detention was not to exceed the maximum period which may be fixed by the <ORG> was enough But they did take care to make a special provision for class No and it is extermly important for the liberty of the subject as well as for the smooth working of the Constitu tion that this provision should not be lightly treated but should receive a well considered and reasonable construc tion It is elementary that the rigour of a law should correspond to or fit the gravity of the evil or danger it aims at combating and it is also evident that the law which the <ORG> has been permitted to enact under article a can so far as rigour is concerned go to the I farthest limit Hence the authors of the Constitution have made it necessary that the <ORG> should put certain specifications into the Act which it is empowered to pass under article a so that by means of these specifications the necessity for enacting so drastic a law should be apparent on the face of it and its application should be confined to the classes and circumstances specified The Act must prescribe ass or classes of cases which are to have reference to the persons against whom the law is to operate and their activities and movements and circumstances which would bring into prominence the conditions and the backgrounds against which dangerous activities should call for special measures By means of such two fold prescription the sphere for the application of the law will be confined only to a special type of cases it will be less vague less open to abuse and enable those who have to administer it to determine objec tively when a condition has arisen to justify the use of the power vested in them by the law This in my opinion is the true meaning and significance of article a and any attempt to whittle it down will lead to deplorable results It does not prescribe circumstances at all and though it purports to prescribe the class or classes it does so in a manner showing that the true meaning of the provision from which the <ORG> derived its power has not been grasped But I must point out that even if it be assumed that the view advanced by the learned Attorney General is correct and it was within the competence of <ORG> to treat any of the categories mentioned in items and of Lists I and III as constitut ing a class and to include it without any qualification or change the impugned section cannot be saved on account of a two fold error There can be no doubt that circumstances and class or classes are two different expressions and have different meanings but the Act proceeds on the assumption that cir cumstances are identical with class or classes as will appear from the words any person detained in any of the following classes of cases or under any of the following circumstances used in the section There can in my opinion be no escape from the conclusion that section of the Act by which a most impor tant protection or safeguard conferred on the subject by the Constitution has been taken away is not a valid provision since it contravenes the very provision in the Constitution under which the <ORG> derived its competence to enact it I will now briefly deal with article which makes it incumbent on the authority ordering preventive deten tion to communicate to the person detained the grounds on which the order has been made and to give him the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order It must be remembered that this provision is intended to afford protection to and be a safeguard in favour of a detained person and it cannot be read as limiting any rights which he has under the law or any other provisions of the Consti tution If article guarantees that before a person is deprived of his liberty he must be allowed an opportunity of establishing his innocence before an impartial tribunal that right still remains In point of fact there is no express exclusion of that right in the Constitution and no prohibition against constituting an impartial tribunal On the other hand the right to make a representation which has been granted under the Constitution must carry with it the right to the representation being properly considered by an impartial person or persons In the view I take all that <ORG> could do under clause a of article was to dispense with an advisory board for the purpose contemplated in clause a of that article and not to dispense with the proper machinery by whichever name it may be called for the purpose of examining the merits of the case of a detained person It was argued that article is a code by itself and the whole law of preventive detention is to be found within its four corners It is said that it provides for notice an opportuni ty to the detenu to represent his case an advisory board which may deal with his case and for the maximum period beyond which a person cannot be detained The right to represent is given but it is left to the legislature to provide the machinery for dealing with the representation There is ample latitude still left to the <ORG> and if the <ORG> makes use of that latitude unreasonably article may enable the <ORG> to see whether it has transgressed the limits of reasonableness I will now proceed to deal with the Act in the light of the conclusions I have arrived at So far as section of the Act is concerned it was contended that it is most unreasonable because it throws a citizen at the mercy of certain authorities who may at their own will order his detention and into whose minds we cannot probe to see wheth er there is any foundation for the subjective satisfaction upon which their action is to rest The administrative authorities who have to discharge their responsibilities have to come to quick decisions and must necessarily be left to act on their own judgment Under section of that code it is left to the discretion of the magistrate concerned to determine whether in his opinion there is sufficient ground for proceeding against any person who is likely to occasion a breach of the peace I do not also find anything radically wrong in section of the Act which makes it incumbent on the authority con cerned to communicate to a detenu the grounds on which the order has been made and to afford him the earliest opportunity of making a representa tion against the order The real sections which appear to me to offend the Constitution are sections and I also think that even if it be held that it technically complies with the requirements of article a <ORG> has acted unreasonably in exercising its discretionary power without applying its mind to essential matters and thus depriving the detenus of the safeguard of an advisory board which the Constitution has provided in normal cases So far as section is con cerned all my colleagues have held it to be ultra vires and as I agree with the views expressed by them I do not wish to encumber my judgment by repeating in my own words what has been said so clearly and so well by them This writ will of course be without prejudice to any action which the authorities may have taken or may hereafter take against the petitioner under the penal law I have to add this qualification because there were allega tions of his being involved in some criminal cases but the actual facts were not clearly brought out before us During the first war as well as the second a number of persons were detained and a number of cases were brought to <ORG> in connection with their detention but the two lead ing cases which will be quoted again and again are <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> Sir <NAME> We are aware that in America certain standards which do not conform to ordinary and normal law have been applied by the Judges during the period of the war and sometimes they are compen dionsly referred to as being included in war power The two English cases to which I have referred also illustrate the same principle as will appear from two short extracts which I wish to reproduce In <NAME> <NAME> Lord <NAME> observed as follows However precious the personal liberty of the subject may be there is something for which it may well be to some extent sacrificed by legal enactment namely national success in the war or escape from national plunder or enslavement These passages represent the majority view in the two cases but the very elaborate judgments of Lord <NAME> in <NAME> <NAME> and that of Lord <NAME> in <NAME> Sir <NAME> show that there It is difficult to say that there is not a good substratum of sound law in the celebrat ed dictum of Lord <NAME> that even amidst the clash of arms the laws are not silent and that they speak the same lan guage in war as in peace There was also a provision in the Act of that the Secretary of <ORG> should report at least once in every month as to the action taken under the regulation including the number of persons detained under orders made thereunder I find that there is a provision in section of the Act for the review of the cases of detenus after six months but this is quite different from examining the merits of the case I also realize that those who run the <ORG> have very onerous responsibilities and it is not correct to say that emergent conditions have altogether disappeared from this country Granting then that private rights must often be subordinated to the public good is it not essen tial in a free community to strike a just balance in the matter That a person should be deprived of his personal liberty without a trial is a serious matter but the needs of society may demand it and the individual may often have to yield to those needs <NAME> is an application under arti cle of the Constitution of India for releasing the petitioner from detention in jail without trial under directions purporting to be issued by <ORG> under the Preventive Detention Act and it has the distinction of being the first application invoking the guaranteed protection of this <ORG> as the guardian of Fundamental Rights against alleged infringement of the petitioner right to freedom of movement As the case involved issues of great public importance and breaking of new ground it was argued with thoroughness and ability on both sides reference being made to more or less analogous provisions of the Constitutions of other countries and in particular the Constitution of the United States of America The petitioner had been under detention previously under orders passed by the said Government under the Madras Main tenance of Public Order Act but as the validity of that Act and all other similar local public safety enact ments had been questioned in some of <ORG> in India after the new Constitution came into force the Par liament enacted a comprehensive measure called the Preven tive Detention Act hereinafter referred to as the impugned Act extending to the whole of India with a certain exception not material here The Act came into force on th February and on the th February the Government of Madras in purported exercise of the powers conferred by the impugned Act and in supersession of earlier orders directed the detention of the petitioner and the order was served on him on st March It is modelled on the first ten Amendments of the American Con stitution which declare the fundamental rights of the American citizen Article which is the first article in this Part defines the State as including the Governments and Legislatures of the Union and the States as well as all local and other authorities against which the fundamental rights are enforceable and article declares that all existing laws inconsistent with the provisions of Part III shall to the extent of the inconsistency be void Clause of the article on which the petitioner con tention is primarily founded reads as follows The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this Part and any law made in contravention of this clause shall to the extent of the contravention be void As the constitutional inhibition against deprivation or abridgement relates only to the rights conferred by this Part it is necessary first to ascertain the nature and extent of the right which according to the petitioner Part III has conferred on him and secondly to determine wheth er the right so ascertained has been taken away or abridged by the impugned Act or by any of its provisions The first question turns on the proper interpretation of the relevant articles of the Constitution and the second involves the consideration of the provisions of the impugned Act In the first place the right to move freely throughout the territory of India referred to in article is of the very essence of personal liber ty and inasmuch as the detention authorised by the impugned Act was not a reasonable restriction which <ORG> could validly impose on such right under clause of the article the impugned Act is void Alternatively the petitioner had a fundamental right under article not to be deprived of his personal liberty except according to procedure established by law and the impugned Act by autho rising detention otherwise than in accordance with proper procedure took away that right and was therefore void But the question is Does article in its setting in Part III of the Constitution deal with the deprivation of per sonal liberty in the sense of incarceration Sub clause of clause does not refer to freedom of movement simplic iter but guarantees the right to move freely throughout the territory of India Sub clause similarly guaran tees the right to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India Reading these provisions together it is reasonably clear that they were designed primarily to emphasise the factual unity of the territory of India and to secure the right of a free citizen to move from one place in India to another and to reside and settle in any part of India unhampered by any barriers which nar row minded provincialism may seek to interpose The use of the word restrictions in the various sub clauses seems to imply in the context that the rights guaranteed by the article are still capable of being exercised and to exclude the idea of incarceration though the words restriction and deprivation are sometimes used as interchangeable terms as restriction may reach a point where it may well amount to deprivation Read as a whole and viewed in its setting among the group of provisions articles relating to Right to Freedom article seems to my mind to pre suppose that the citizen to whom the possession of these fundamental rights is secured retains the substratum of personal freedom on which alone the enjoyment of these rights necessarily rests It was said that subclause would militate against this view as the enjoyment of the right to acquire hold and dispose of property does not depend upon the owner retaining his personal freedom This assumption is obviously wrong as regards moveable proper ties and even as regards immoveables he could not acquire or dispose of them from behind the prison bars nor could he hold them in the sense of exercising rights of possession and control over them which is what the word seems to mean in the context In other words article guarantees to the citizens the enjoyment of certain civil liberties while they are free while articles secure to all persons citizens and non citizens certain constitutional guarantees in regard to punishment and prevention of crime Different criteria are provided by which to measure legisla tive judgments in the two fields and a construction which would bring within article imprisonment in punishment of a crime committed or in prevention of a crime threatened would as it seems to me make a reductio ad absurdum of that provision If imprisonment were to be regarded as a restriction of the right mentioned in article it would equally be a restriction on the rights mentioned by the other subclauses of clause with the result that all penal laws providing for imprisonment as a mode of punish ment would have to run the gauntlet of clauses to before their validity could be accepted For instance the law which imprisons for theft would on that view fall to be justified under clause as a law sanctioning restric tion of freedom of speech and expression Indeed <ORG> of <ORG> in a recent unreport ed decision brought to our notice applied the test of undermining the security of the <ORG> or tending to overthrow it in determining the validity or otherwise of the impugned Act The learned Judges construed article as covering cases of deprivation of personal liberty and held logically enough that inasmuch as the impugned Act by authorising preventive detention infringed the right to freedom of speech and expression its validity should be judged by the reservations in clause and as it failed to stand that test it was unconstitutional and void He drew a dis tinction between the right conferred by sub clause and those conferred by the other sub clauses He urged refer ring to Blackstone Commentaries that personal liberty consisted in moving one person to whatever place one inclination might direct and that any law which de prived a person of such power of locomotion was a direct invasion of the right mentioned in sub clause whereas it inter fered only indirectly and consequentially with the rights mentioned in the other sub Clauses There is no substance in the distinction suggested All the rights mentioned in clause are equally essential elements in the liberty of the individual in any civilised and democrat ic community and imprison ment operates as an extinction of all of them alike It cannot therefore be said that deprivation of personal liberty is an infringement of the right conferred by sub clause alone but not of the others The learned Judges of <ORG> realised this and were perfectly logical in holding that the constitutional validity of a law providing for deprivation of personal liberty or imprisonment must be judged by the tests laid down not only in clause of article but also in the other clauses including clause though their major premise that deprivation of personal liberty was a restriction within the meaning of article is in my judgment erroneous It was said that preventive detention being a drasic re striction of the right to move freely was in its pith and substance within article read with clause and not within article which deals with crime and its punishment and prevention There is no room here in my opinion for the application of the rule of pith and sub stance Article as I have already indicated guarantees protection for the more important civil liberties of citizens who are in the enjoyment of their freedom while at the same time laying down the re strictions which the legislature may properly impose on the exercise of such rights and it has nothing to do with deprivation of personal liberty or imprisonment which is dealt with by the succeeding three articles There is also another consideration which points to the same conclusion <ORG> to whose Report reference was freely made by both sides during the argument recommended that the word liber ty should be qualified by the insertion of the word person al before it for otherwise it might be construed very widely so as to include even the freedoms already dealt with in article now article connotation of the expression personal liberty it was used in article in a sense which excludes the freedoms dealt with in article that is to say personal liberty in the context of Part III of the Constitution is something distinct from the freedom to move freely throughout the territory of India It was further submitted that article declared the substantive rights of personal liberty while article provided the procedural safeguard against their deprivation This view of the correlation between the two articles has found favour with some of the Judges in <ORG> which have had occasion to consider the constitutional validity of the impugned Act It is however to be ob served that article confers the rights therein specified only on the citizens of India while article extends the protection of life and personal liberty to all persons citizens and noncitizens alike Thus the two articles do not operate in a conterminous field and this is one reason for rejecting the correlation suggested Again if article is to be understood as providing only proce dural safeguards where is the substantive right to personal liberty of non citizens to be found in the Constitution Are they denied such right altogether If they are to have no right of personal liberty why is the proce dural safeguard in article exended to them And where is that most fundamental right of all the right to life provided for in the Constitution The truth is that arti cle like its American prototype in the Fifth and Four teenth Amendments of the Constitution of the United States presents an example of the fusion of procedural and substan tive rights in the same provision And the first and essential step in a proce dure established by law for such deprivation must be a law made by a competent legislature Authorising such deprivation This brings me to the consid eration of articles and to which was deroted the greater part of the debate at the <ORG> No person shall be deprived of his life or person al liberty except according to procedure established by law No person who is arrested shall be detained in custody without being informed as soon as may be of the grounds for such arrest nor shall he be denied the right to consult and to be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice Every person who is arrested and detained in custody shall be produced before the nearest magistrate within a period of twenty four hours of such arrest excluding the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the Court of the magistrate and no such person shall be detained in custody beyond the said period without the authority of a magistrate Nothing in clauses and shall apply a to any person who for the time being is an enemy alien or to any person who is arrested or detained under any law providing for preventive detention No law providing for preventive detention shall authorise the detention of a person for a longer period than three months unless a an Advisory Board consisting of persons who are or have been or are qualified to be appointed as Judges of <ORG> has reported before the expiration of the said period of three months that there is in its opinion suffi cient cause for such detention Provided that nothing in this sub clause shall autho rise the detention of any person beyond the maximum period prescribed by any law made by parliament under sub clause of clause or such person is detained in accordance with the provisions of any law made by <ORG> under sub clauses a and of clause When any person is detained in pursuance of an order made under any law providing for preventive detention the authority making the order shall as soon as may be commu nicate to such person the grounds on which the order has been made and shall afford him the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order Nothing in clause shall require the authority making any such order as is referred to in that clause to disclose facts which such authority considers to be against the public interest to disclose Parliament may by law prescribe a the circumstances under which and the class or classes of cases in which a person may be detained for a period longer than three months under any law providing for preven tive detention without obtaining the opinion of <ORG> in accordance with the provisions of sub clause a of clause the maximum period for which any person may in any class or classes of cases be detained under any law provid ing for preventive detention and the procedure to be followed by <ORG> in an inquiry under sub clause a of clause Mr <NAME> urged that the word law in article should be understood not in the sense of an enactment but as signifying the immutable and universal principles of natural justice the jus naturale of the civil law and that the expression procedure established by law meant the same thing as that famous phrase due process of law in the American Constitution in its procedural aspect Numerous American decisions were cited to show that the phrase implied the basic requirements of an objective and ascertainable standard of conduct to which it is possi ble to conform notice to the party of the accusation against him a reasonable opportunity for him to estab lish his innocence and an impartial tribunal capable of giving an unbiased judgment Mr <NAME> conceded that these requirements might have to be modified or adapted to suit the nature of the particular proceeding and the object it had in view as for instance in a case of preventive detention previous notice which might result in the person concerned going underground might be dispensed with Learned counsel insisted that these requirements being the very core of the principles of natural justice which transcended all State made laws must be substantially complied with by any law governing the process of deprivation of life or personal liberty subject of course to any express provision in the Constitution sanctioning their relaxation or dispensation in any case or class of cases He also appealed to the Pream ble of the Constitution as the guiding star in its interpre tation to support his thesis that in view of the democratic Constitution which the people of India have purported to give themselves guaranteeing to the citizens certain funda mental rights which are justiciabke the provisions of Part III must be construed as being paramount to the legislative will as otherwise the socalled fundamental right to life and personal liberty would have no protection against legis lative action and article would be rendered nugato ry There can be no doubt that the people of India have in exercise of their sovereign will as expressed in the Pream ble adopted the democratic ideal which assures to the citizen the dignity of the individual and other cherished human values as a means to the full evolution and expression of his personality and in delegating to the legislature the executive and the judiciary their respective powers in the Constitution reserved to themselves certain fundamental rights socalled I apprehend because they have been re tained by the people and made paramount to the delegated powers as in the American model <NAME> who played a prominent part in framing the First Amendment of the Ameri can Constitution pointing out the distinction due to historical reasons between the American and the British ways of securing the great and essential rights of the people observed Here they are secured not by laws para mount to prerogative but by Constitutions paramount to laws Report on the Virginia Resolutions quoted in <NAME> Minnesota This has been translated into positive law in Part III of the Indian Constitution and I agree that in construing these provisions the high purpose and spirit of the Preamble as well as the constitutional significance of a Declaration of Fundamental Rights should be borne in mind This howev er is not to say that the language of the provisions should be stretched to square with this or that constitutional theory in disregard of the cardinal rule of interpretation of any enactment constitutional or other that its spirit no less than its intendment should be collected primarily from the natural meaning of the words used Procedure established by law must be taken to refer to a procedure which has a statutory origin for no procedure is known or can be said to have been established by such vague and uncertain concepts as the immutable and universal principles of natural justice No doubt the American Judges have adopted the other connotation in their interpretation of the due process clause in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Ameri can Constitution Nor shall any person be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law it gained ground America at first as a weapon in the hands of the Revolu tionists with which to resist the laws of <ORG> and later as an instrument in the hands of the Judges for estab lishing the supremacy of the judiciary see <NAME> <NAME> And when that power was threatened with prostration by the excesses of due process the equally vague and expansive doctrine of police power i the power of <ORG> to regulate private rights in public interest was evolved to counteract such excesses A century after the phrase had been the subject of judicial interpretation one learned Judge observed in that it was incapable of precise definition and that its intent and application could only be ascer tained by the gradual process of inclusion and exclusion <NAME> New Orleans and as recently as another Judge referred to the difficulty of giving defi niteness to the vague contours of due process and of spinning judgment upon <ORG> action out of that gossamer concept <NAME> <ORG> of Ohio limitations to which they must necessarily be subject as definite as possible since the <ORG> may have to pronounce upon them para article stands for the jus naturale of the civil law and that the phrase according to procedure established by law is equivalent to due process of law in its procedural aspect for that would have the effect of introducing into our Constitution those subtle and elusive criteria implied in that phrase which it was the deliberate purpose of the framers of our Constitution to avoid On the other hand the interpretation suggested by the Attorney General on behalf of the intervener that the ex pression means nothing more than procedure prescribed by any law made by a competent legislature is hardly more accept able Established according to him means prescribed and if <ORG> or the <ORG> enacted a proce dure however novel and ineffective for affording the ac cused person a fair opportunity of defending himself it would be sufficient for depriving a person of his life or personal liberty Learned counsel drew attention to the speeches made by several members of the <ORG> on the floor of the <ORG> for explaining as he put it the his torical background A speech made in the course of the debate on a bill could at best be indicative of the subjective intent of the speaker but it could not reflect the inarticulate mental processes lying behind the majority vote which carried the bill The <ORG> could only search for the objec tive intent of the legislature primarily in the words used in the enactment aided by such historical material as reports of statutory committees preambles etc I attach no importance therefore to the speeches made by some of the members of the Constituent <ORG> in the course of the debate on article now article The main difficulty I feel in accepting the construction suggested by the Attorney General is that it completely stultifies article and indeed the very conception of a fundamental right It is of the essence of that con ception that it is protected by the fundamental law of the Constitution against infringement by ordinary legislation Could it then have been the inten tion of the framers of the Constitution that the most impor tant fundamental rights to life and personal liberty should be at the mercy of legislative majorities as in effect they would be if established were to mean merely pre scribed In other words as an American Judge said in a similar context does the constitutional prohibition in article amount to no more than You shall not take away life or personal freedom unless you choose to take it away which is mere verbiage It is no sound answer to say that if article conferred no right immune from legisla tive invasion there would be no question of contravening article The argument seems to my mind to beg the question for it assumes that the article affords no such immunity It is said that article affords no protection against competent legislative action in the field of substantive criminal law for there is no provision for judicial review on the ground of reasonable ness or otherwise of such laws as in the case of the rights enumerated in article It was argued that law in article which provides that no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law must mean enacted law and that if a person property could be taken away by legislative action his right to life and personal liberty need not enjoy any greater immunity Clause of article provides for payment of compensation and that right is justiciable except in the two cases mentioned in clauses and which are of a tran sitory character Much reliance was placed on the Irish case The King The Military Governor of Hare Park Camp where the Court held that the term law in article of the Irish Constitu tion of which provides that the liberty of the person is inviolable and no person shall be deprived of his liberty except in accordance with law meant a law enacted by the <ORG> and that therefore the Public Safety Act of did not contravene the Constitution The Attorney General further submitted that even on his interpretation article would be a protection against violation of the rights by the executive and by individuals an that would be sufficient justification for the article ranking as a fundamental safeguard There is no substance in the suggestion As pointed out in <NAME> Gov ernment of Nigeria Officer Administering the execu tive could only act in pursuance of the powers given by law and no constitutional protection against such action is really needed Even in monarchical Britain the struggle between prerogative and law has long since ended in favour of the latter In accordance with British jurisprudence said Lord <NAME> in the case cited above no member of the executive can interfere with the liberty or property of a British subject except on the condition that he can support the legality of his action before <ORG> After giving the matter my most careful and anxious consideration I have come to the conclusion that there are only two possible solutions of the problem In the first place a satisfactory via media between the two extreme positions contended for on either side may be found by stressing the word established which implies some degree of firmness permanence and general acceptance while it does not exclude origination by statute Procedure estab lished by law may well be taken to mean what <ORG> referred to in King Emperor <NAME> as the ordinary and well established criminal proce dure that is to say those settled usages and normal modes of proceeding sanctioned by the Criminal Procedure Code which is the general law of criminal procedure in the coun try It can be no objection to this view that the Code prescribes no single and uniform proce dure for all types of cases but provides varying procedures for different classes of cases Certain basic principles emerge as the constant factors common to all those proce dures and they form the core of the procedure established by law The different measures of constitutional protection which the fundamental right to life and personal liberty will enjoy under article as interpreted in the three ways Suppose that article was not there and <ORG> passed an Act as a temporary measure taking away in certain cases the right of an accused person to be defended by a legal practitioner According to the petition er learned counsel the Act would be void as being contrary to the immutable principles of natural justice embodied in article whereas on the construction contended for by the Attorney General the Act would be perfectly valid while on the view I have indicated above the Act would be bad but if the denial of such right of defence is made a normal feature of the ordinary law of criminal procedure by abro gating section of the Code article would be powerless to protect against such legislative action But in a free democratic republic such a drastic change in the normal law of procedure though theoretically possi ble would be difficult to bring about and that practical difficulty will be the measure of the protection afforded by article The only alternative to the construction I have indi cated above if a constitutional transgression is to be avoided would be to interpret the reference to law as implying a constitutional amendment pro tanto for it is only a law enacted by the procedure provided for such amend ment article that could modify or override a fundamen tal right without contravening article The learned Attorney General contended that article did not apply to preventive detention at all as article clauses to formed a complete code of constitutional safeguards in respect of preventive detention and provided only these provisions are conformed to the validity of any law relat ing to preventive detention could not be challenged If it was really the intention of the framers of the Constitution to exclude the application of article to cases of preventive detention nothing would have been easier than to add a reference to article in clause of article which provides that clauses and of the latter shall not apply to any person who is arrested or detained under any law providing for preventive detention Nor is there anything in the language of clauses to of article leading necessarily to the inference that article is inapplicable to preventive detention These clauses deal only with certain aspects of preventive deten tion such as the duration of such detention the constitu tion of an advisory board for reviewing the order of deten tion in certain cases the communication of the grounds of detention to the person detained and the provision of an opportunity to him of making a representation against the order It cannot be said that these provisions form an exhaustive code dealing with all matters relating to preven tive detention and cover the entire area of protection which article interpretedin the sense I have indicated above would afford to the person detained I will now proceed to examine whether the impugned Act or any of its provisions under which the petitioner has been ordered to be detained takes away any of the rights con ferred by articles and or infringes the protection afforded thereby The outstanding fact to be borne in mind in this connection is that preventive detention has been given a constitutional status In the first place as already stated clause of article excludes a person detained under any law providing for preventive detention from the benefit of the safeguards provided in clauses and No doubt clause of the same article makes some amends for the deprivation of these safeguards in that it provides for the communication to the person detained the grounds on which the order has been made and for an opportunity being afforded to him of making a representation against the order but the important right to consult and to be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice is gone It was not disputed that to the extent to which the express provisions of clauses to authorised the abrogation or abridgement of the safeguards provided under other articles or substitution of other safeguards in a modified form those express provisions must rule Of the four essentials of the due process on which Mr <NAME> insisted which also form part of the ordinary and established procedure under the Criminal Procedure Code though I cannot agree that they are immutable and beyond legislative change the requirements of notice and an opportunity to establish his innocence must as already stated be taken to have been provided for by clause of article As for an ascertainable standard of conduct to which it is possible to conform article makes no specific provision in cases of preventive detention and if such a safeguard can be said to be implicit in the procedure established by law in the sense explained above in preventive detention cases it could no doubt be invoked This Mr <NAME> submitted was left unprovided for by article the advisory board referred to in clause a being according to him intended to deal solely with the question of duration of the detention that is to say whether or not there was sufficient cause for detaining the person concerned for more than three months and not with judging whether the person detained was innocent A tribunal which could give an unbiassed judg ment on that issue was an essential part of the protection afforded by article in whichever way it may be interpret ed and reference was made in this connection to the preven tive provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code Ch The impugned Act not having provided for such a tribunal contravened article and was therefore void Is that view correct It was argued that the words sufficient cause for such detention in sub clause a of clause had reference to the detention beyond three months mentioned in clause and that this view was supported by the language of sub clause a of clause whereby <ORG> is authorised to prescribe the circumstances under which and the class or classes of cases in which a person may be detained for a period longer than three months without the opinion of an advisory board In other words learned counsel submitted the combined effect of clauses and was that no person could be detained for a period over three months without obtaining the opinion of an advisory board that there was sufficient cause for detention for the longer period except in cases where <ORG> passed a law autho rising detention for such period even without the opinion of an advisory board The fact that the advisory board is required to make its report before the expiry of three months and so could submit it only a day or two earlier cannot legitimately lead to an inference that the board was solely concerned with the issue whether or not the detention should continue beyond that period Before any such tribunal could send in its report a reasonable time must elapse as the grounds have to be communicated to the person detained he has to make his representation to the detaining authority which has got to be placed before the board through the appropriate departmental channel Assuming however that the words such detention had reference to the period of detention there is no apparent reason for confining the enquiry by the advisory board to the sole issue of duration beyond three months without reference to the question as to whether the detention was justified or not Indeed if is difficult to conceive how a tribunal could fairly judge whether a person should be detained for more than three months without at the same time considering whether there was sufficient cause for the detention at all I am of opinion that the advisory board referred to in clause is the machinery devised by the Constitution for reviewing orders for preventive detention in certain cases on a consideration of the representations made by the persons detained This is the view on which <ORG> has proceeded in enacting the impugned Act as will be seen from sections and thereof and I think it is the correct view Mr <NAME> however objected that on this view a law could authorise preventive detention for three months with out providing for review by any tribunal and for even longer periods if <ORG> passed an Act such as is con templated in sub clause a of clause Turning next to the provisions of the impugned Act whose constitutional validity was challenged it will be necessary to consider only those provisions which affect the petitioner before us In the first place it was contended that section which empowers <ORG> or <ORG> to detain any person if it is satisfied that it is necessary to do so with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to among other things the security of the <ORG> or the maintenance of public order cannot be said to comply with the procedure established by law as the section prescribes no objective and ascertainable standard of conduct to which it will be possible to conform but leaves it to the will and pleasure of the Government concerned to make an order of detention TIm argument proceeds on the assumption that the procedure established by law is equivalent to the due process of law As tim very term implies the detention in such cases is effected with a view to prevent the person concerned from acting prejudi cially to certain objects which the legislation providing for such detention has in view having been laid on the executive Government it must naturally be left to that Government to exercise the power of preventive detention whenever they think the occa sion demands it Any person detained in any of the following classes of cases or under any of the following circumstances may be detained without obtaining the opinion of <ORG> for a period longer than three months but not exceeding one year from the date of his detention namely where such person has been detained with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to a the defence of India relations of India with for eign powers or the security of India or the security of a State of the maintenance of public order The case of every person detained under a detention order to which the provisions of sub section apply shall within a period of six months from the date of his detention be reviewed where the order was made by <ORG> or a State Government by such Govern ment and where the order was made by any officer specified in sub section of section by <ORG> to which such officer is subordinate in consultation with a person who is or has been or is qualified to be appointed as a Judge of <ORG> nominated in that behalf by <ORG> or <ORG> as the case may be It was urged that this did not comply with the require ments of clause of article as it merely repeated the matters or legislative topics mentioned in Entry of List I and Entry of List III of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution What <ORG> has to do under clause of article is to prescribe the circumstances under which and the class or classes of cases in which a person may be detained for a period longer than three months without obtaining the opinion of an advisory board It was said that clause a provided for ordinary cases of preventive detention Where such detention could not continue beyond three months without obtaining the opinion of an advisory board whereas clause a made provision for special cases of detention for more than three months with out the safeguard of the advisory board opinion for aggravated forms of prejudicial conduct It was therefore necessary for <ORG> to indicate to the detaining authority for its guidance the more aggravated forms of prejudicial activity and mere mention of the subjects in respect of which <ORG> is authorised under the legislative lists to make laws in respect of preventive detention could hardly afford any guidance to such authority and should not be regarded as sufficient compliance with the requirements of clause There is a two fold fallacy in this argument Reading clauses and together it is reasonably clear that preventive detention could last longer in two cases where the opinion of an advisory board is obtained subject however to a prescribed period sub clause a of clause and where a person is detained under a law made by <ORG> under sub clauses a and of clause sub clause of clause Secondly the argument loses sight of the fact that clause deals with preventive detention which is a purely precautionary measure which must necessarily proceed in all cases to some extent on suspicion or anticipation as distinct from proof per Lord <NAME> in <NAME> <NAME> How could the insertion in section of a long series of categories of aggravated forms of prejudicial activities or the enumeration of the various circumstances in which such activities are likely to be indulged in be of any assist ance to the detaining authority in determining whether the person concerned should be detained for three months or for a longer period All that would be necessary and suffi cient for him to know for coming to a decision on the point is that the person is a member of such an organisation and will probably engage in subversive activities prejudicial to the security of the <ORG> or the maintenance of public order or in other words he belongs to class in section Reference was made in this connection to Rule of the Defence of India Rules framed under the Defence of India Act where prejudicial act is defined by enumeration In Lists I and III of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution six topics are mentioned in respect of which <ORG> could make laws providing for preventive detention and section of the impugned Act mentions five of them as being the classes of cases or the circumstances in which longer detention is authorised A class can well be designated with refer ence to the end which one desires to secure and the matters referred to as classes a and of sub section of section being clearly the objects which <ORG> desired to secure by enacting the section it seems to me that the classification with refer ence to such general aims does not contravene article It was argued that <ORG> did not in enacting section perform its duty of prescribing both the circumstances and the class or classes of cases where detention without obtaining the advisory board opinion could be for a period longer than three months There is no substance in this objection As I read article it means that <ORG> may prescribe either the circumstances or the classes of cases or both and in enacting section <ORG> evidently regarded the matters mentioned in clause a and of sub section as sufficiently indic ative both of the Circumstances under which and the classes in which a person could be detained for the longer period To say for instance that persons who are likely to act prejudicially to the defence of India may be detained beyond three months is at once to prescribe a class of persons in which and the circumstances under which a person may be detained for the longer period Lastly Mr <NAME> turned his attack on section which prohibits the disclosure of the grounds of detention communicated to the person detained and of the representa tion made by him against the order of detention and debars the <ORG> from allowing such disclosure to be made except for purposes of a prosecution punishable under sub section which makes it an offence for any person to disclose or publish such grounds or representation without the previous authorisation of <ORG> or <ORG> as the case may be The petitioner com plains that this provision nullifies in effect the rights conferred upon him under clause of article which entitles him to have the grounds of his detention communi cated to him and to make a representation against the order If the grounds are too vague to enable him to make any such representation or if they are altogether irrelevant to the object of his detention or are such as to show that his detention is not bona fide he has the further right of moving this <ORG> and this remedy is also guaranteed to him under article There is great force in this contention All that the Attorney General could say in answer was that if the other provisions of the Act were held to be valid it would not be open to the <ORG> to examine the sufficiency of the grounds on which the executive authority was satisfied that detention was necessary as laid down in <NAME> The King and so the petitioner could not complain of any infringement of his rights by reason of section which enacted only a rule of evidence The argument overlooks that it was recognised in the decision referred to above that it would be open to the <ORG> to examine the grounds of detention in order to see whether they were relevant to the object which the legislature had An examina tion of the grounds for these purposes is made impossible by section and the protection afforded by article and article is thereby rendered nugatory It follows that section contravenes the provisions of article and article in so far as it prohibits the person detained from disclosing to the <ORG> the grounds of his detention communicated to him by the detaining authority or the repre sentation made by him against the order of detention and prevents the <ORG> from examining them for the purposes aforesaid and to that extent it must be held under article to be void <NAME> of India having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a Sovereign Democratic Republic on the th day of November gave to themselves a Constitution which came into force on the th January It was said in the order that the Governor of Madras was satisfied that it was necessary to make the order with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of the State and the maintenance of public order On th March a petition was presented to this <ORG> under article of the Constitution praying for the issue of a writ of habeas corpus directing the State of Madras to produce him before the <ORG> and to set him at liberty The decision of the question whether Act IV of takes away or abridges the rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution depends on a consideration of two points In what measure has the Constitution secured person al liberty to a citizen of India and It will cease to have effect on st April It empowers <ORG> and the <ORG> Governments to make an order directing a person to be detained with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the defence of India the relations of India with foreign powers or the security of India It also gives power to detain a person who acts in any manner prejudicial to the security of the <ORG> or the maintenance of public order or the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community It came into force on th February and was enacted by virtue of the powers conferred on <ORG> by article clause of Part III of the Constitution read with the entries in the th Schedule It may also be observed that an Act cannot be declared void because in the opinion of the <ORG> it is opposed to the spirit supposed to pervade the Constitution but not so expressed in words It is difficult on any general principles to limit the omnipo tence of the sovereign legislative power by judicial inter position except in so far as the express words of a written Constitution give that authority Article of our Constitution gives such an authority and to the extent stated therein It says that the <ORG> shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this Part and any law made in contravention of this clause shall to the extent of the contravention be void The Government of India Act conferred authority on <ORG> to enact laws on this subject for the first time and since then laws on this subject have taken firm root here and have become a permanent part of the statute book of this country The jurisdiction however to enact these laws is subject to the provisions of Part III of the Constitu tion Article in this Part provides No person who is arrested shall be detained in custody without being informed as soon as may be of the grounds for such arrest nor shall he be denied the right to consult and to be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice Every person who is arrested and detained in custody shall be produced before the nearest magistrate within a period of twenty four hours of such arrest excluding the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the Court of the magistrate and no such person shall be detained in custody beyond the said period without the authority of a magistrate Nothing in clauses and shall apply a to any person who for the time being is an enemy alien or to any person who is arrested or detained under any law providing for preventive detention No law providing for preventive detention shall authorise the detention of a person for a longer period than three months unless a <ORG> consisting of persons who are or have been or are qualified to be appointed as Judges of <ORG> has reported before the expiration of the said period of three months that there is in its opinion suffi cient cause for such detention Provided that nothing in this sub clause shall authorise the detention of any person beyond the maximum period pre scribed by any law made by <ORG> under sub clause of clause or such person is detained in accordance with the provisions of any law made by <ORG> under sub clauses a and of clause When any person is detained in pursuance of an order made under any law providing for preventive detention the authority making the order shall as soon as may be commu nicate to such person the grounds on which the order has been made and shall afford him the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order Nothing in clause shall require the authority making any such order as is referred to in that clause to disclose facts which such authority considers to be against the public interest to disclose parliament may by law prescribe a the circumstances under which and the class or classes of cases in which a person may be detained for a period longer than three months under any law providing for preven tive detention without obtaining the opinion of <ORG> in accordance with the provisions of sub clause a of clause the maximum period for which any person may in any class or classes of cases be detained under any law provid ing for preventive detention and the procedure to be followed by <ORG> in an inquiry under sub clause a of clause The question of the constitutional validity of the impugned statute has to be approached with great caution in view of these provisions of the Constitution and has to be considered with patient attention Preventive detention means a complete negation of freedom of movement and of personal liberty and is incompatible with both those subjects and yet it is placed in the same compartment with them in Part III of the Constitution Though the Constitution has recognized the necessity of laws as to preventive detention it has also provided certain safeguards to mitigate their harshness by placing fetters on legislative power conferred on this subject These are That no law can provide for detention for a period of more than three months unless the sufficiency for the cause of the detention is investigated by an advisory board within the said period of three months This provision limits legislative power in the matter of duration of the period of detention That a <ORG> law cannot authorize detention beyond the maximum period prescribed by <ORG> under the powers given to it in clause That <ORG> also cannot make a law authorizing detention for a period beyond three months without the intervention of an advisory board unless the law conforms to the conditions laid down in clause of article Provision also has been made to enable <ORG> to make laws for procedure to be followed by advisory boards Apart from these enabling and disabling provisions certain procedural rights have been expressly safeguarded by clause of article A person detained under a law of preventive detention has a right to obtain information as to the grounds of his detention and has also the right to make a representation protesting against an order of preventive detention It seems to me that when a constitutional right has been conferred as a necessary consequence a constitutional remedy for obtaining redress in case of infringement of the right must be pre sumed to have been contemplated and it could not have been intended that the right was merely illusory and that a representation made may well find place in cold storage Consideration of the representation made by virtue of clause by an unbiassed authority is my opinion a necessary consequence of the guaranteed right contained herein The interpretation that I am inclined to place on clause of article is justi fied by the solemn words of the declaration contained in the Preamble to the Constitution This charter has not been forced out of unwilling hands of a sovereign like the Magna Carta but it has been given to themselves by the people of the country through their Constituent <NAME> If the right of repre sentation given to a detained person by clause of arti cle is a guaranteed right and has been given for the purpose of securing justice then it follows that no justice can be held secured to him unless an unbiassed person considers the merits of the representation and gives his opinion on the guilt or the innocence of the persons detained In my view the right cannot be defeated or made elusive by presuming that the detaining authority itself will consider the representation with an unbiassed mind and will render justice That would in a way make the prosecu tor a judge in the case and such a procedure is repugnant The Constitution has further curtailed the rights given in clause by providing in clause a privilege on the detaining authority of witholding facts which the said authority considers not in public interests to disclose This privilege has been conferred for the security of the <ORG> and possibly for the security of the Constitution itself but in view of these stringent provi sions no additional clogs can be put on the proper consider ation of the representation of the detained person by pre suming that the detaining authority itself will properly consider the representation It has also to be remembered in this context that a person subjected to the law of pre ventive detention has been deprived of the rights conferred on persons who become subject to the law of punitive deten tion vide clauses and of article He has been denied the right to consult a lawyer or be defended by him and he can be kept in detention without being produced before a magistrate Having examined the provisions of article I now proceed to consider the first question that was canvassed before us by the learned Attorney General i that arti cle of the Constitution read with the entries in the th Schedule was a complete Code on the subject of preventive detention and that being so the other articles of Part III could not be invoked in the consideration of the validity of the impugne statute It was however urged that on matters on which this article had made no special provision on this topic the other provisions of Part III of the Constitution had application namely articles and and to that extent laws made on this subject were justiciable In order to draw the inference that the framers of the Constitution intended the provisions as regards preventive detention in article to be self contained a clear indication of such an intention has to be gathered If the provisions embodied in this article have dealt with all the principal questions that are likely to arise in matters of procedure or on questions of the reasonableness of the period of detention the inference of such an indica tion would be irresistible It was contended that all the articles in the Constitution should be read in an harmonious manner and one article should not be read as standing by itself and as having no connection with the other articles in the same part In this connection it was argued that a law made under article would not be valid unless it was in accord with the provisions of article of the Constitution This article provides that no person shall be deprived of life or liberty except according to procedure established by law It was contended that in substance the article laid down that no person will be deprived of life or liberty without having been given a fair trial or a fair hearing and that unless a law of preventive detention provided such a hearing that law would be in contravention of this article and thus void Conceding for the sake of argument but without expressing any opinion on it that this contention of the learned counsel is correct the question arises whether there is anything in article which negatives the application of article as above construed to a law on preventive detention In my opinion sub clause of article read with clauses and leads to the inference that the contention raised by the learned counsel is unsound Clause as already stated provides that notice has to be given to a detenu of the grounds of his detention It also provides a limited hearing inasmuch as it gives him an opportunity to establish his innocence As in my opinion the considera tion of a representation made by a detained person by an unbiassed authority is implicit in clause it gives to the detained person all that he is entitled to under the principles of natural justice The right to consult and to be represented by a counsel of his own choice has been denied in express terms to such a person by the Constitu tion He is also denied an opportunity of appearing before a magistrate When the Constitution has taken away certain rights that ordinarily will be possessed by a detained person and in substitution thereof certain other rights have been conferred on him even in the matter of procedure the inference is clear that the intention was to deprive such a person of the right of an elaborate procedure usually pro vided for in judicial proceedings In its ultimate analysis the argument of the learned counsel for the peti tioner resolves itself to this that the impugned statute does not provide for an impartial tribunal for a considera tion of the representation of the detained person and to this extent it contravenes article of the Constitution As discussed above in <NAME> opinion such a provision is implicit within article itself and that being so the application of article to a law made under article is excluded It was next contended that a law of preventive detention encroaches on the right of freedom of movement within the territory of India guaranteed to a citizen under article and that being so by reason of the provisions of sub clause of article it was justiciable on the ground of reasonableness Preventive detention in substance is a negation of the freedom of locomotion guaranteed under article but it cannot be said that it merely restricts it Be that as it may the question for consideration is whether it was intended that article would govern a law made under the provisions of article It empowers <ORG> to make a law imposing reasonable restriction on the right of freedom of movement while article is auother enabling provision empower ing <ORG> to make a law on the subject of preventive detention in certain circumstances If a law conforms to the conditions laid down in article it would be a good law and it could not have been intended that that law validly made should also conform itself to the provisions of article Article has absolutely no application in such a situation If the intention of the constitution was that a law made on the subject of preventive detention had to be tested on the touchstone of reasonableness then it would not have trou bled itself by expressly making provision in article about the precise scope of the limitation subject to which such a law could be made and by mentioning the procedure that the law dealing with that subject had to provide This provi sion negatives the idea that the deprivation of liberty for a period of three months without the consultation of the advisory board would be justiciable on the ground of reason ableness Again article has provided a safeguard that if an advisory board has to be dispensed with it can only be so dispensed with under a law made by <ORG> and that <ORG> also in enacting such a law has to conform to certain conditions In sub clause of clause of article provision has been made enabling <ORG> to fix the maximum period for which a person can be detained under a law on the sub ject of preventive detention In my judgment therefore an examination of the provisions of article clearly suggests that the intention was to make it self contained as regards the law of preventive detention and that the validity of a law on the subject of preventive detention cannot be exam ined or controlled either by the provisions of article or by the provisions of article because article has no application to such a situation and article is not subject to the provisions of these two articles The Consti tution in article has gone to the extent of even provid ing that <ORG> may by law lay down the procedure to be followed by an advisory board On all important points that could arise in connection with the subject of preventive detention provision has been made in article and that being so the only correct approach in examining the validi ty of a law on the subject of preventive detention is by considering whether the law made satisfied the requirements of article or in any way abridges or contravenes them and if the answer is in the affirmative then the law will be valid but if the answer is in the negative the law would be void lays down sub stantive law as giving protection to life and liberty inas much as it says that they cannot be deprived except accord ing to the procedure established by law in other words it means that before a person can be deprived of his life or liberty as a condition precedent there should exist some substantive law conferring authority for doing so and the law should further provide for a mode of procedure for such depriva tion This article gives complete immunity against the exercise of despotic power by the executive It further gives immunity against invalid laws which contravene the Constitution It gives also further guarantee that in its true concept there should be some form of proceeding before a person can be condemned either in respect of his life or his liberty It negatives the idea of fantastic arbitrary and oppressive forms of proceedings The principles there fore underlying article have been kept in view in draft ing article A law properly made under article and which is valid in all respects under that article and lays down substantive as well as adjective law on this subject would fully satisfy the requirements of article and that being so there is no conflict between these two articles The next question that arises for decision is whether there is anything in Act IV of which offends against the provisions of article of Part III of the Constitu tion It was said that as section laid down no objective rule of conduct for a person and as people were not told as to what behaviour was expected of them the result was that it could not be known what acts a person was expected to avoid and what conduct on his part was prejudi cial to the security of the <ORG> or the maintenance of public order in other words it was argued that section left the determination of the prejudicial act of a person to the arbitrary judgment of the Government and that even the officer who was to administer this law had been furnished no guide and no standard of conduct in arriving at his own satisfaction whether the conduct was prejudicial to the security of the <ORG> etc In the th Schedule jurisdiction to make the law on this subject has been given for reasons connected with defence etc These are subjects which concern the life and the very existence of the <ORG> Section of the impugned Act gives full effect to the provisions of article sub clause and enacts that representation has to be made to the <ORG> or <ORG> Gov ernment as the case may be Section of the Act makes reference to the advisory board obligatory in cases falling under sub clause iii of clause a or clause of sub section of section a within six weeks of the order It was contended that the law had not provided a personal hearing to the detenu before an advisory board nor had it given him a right to lead evi dence to establish his innocence The advisory board has been given the power to call for such information as it requires even from the person detained The opportunity afforded is not as full as a person gets under normal judicial proce dure but when the Constitution itself contemplates a special procedure being prescribed for preventive detention cases then the validity of the law on that subject cannot be impugned on the grounds contended for Section of the Act was also impugned on the ground that it offended against the Constitution inasmuch as it provided for preventive detention for an indefinite period This section in my opinion has to be read in the background of the provision in sub clause of section of the Act which says that the Act will cease to have effect on st April Besides the words for such period as it thinks fit do not in any way offend against the provisions of article wherein <ORG> has been given the power to make a law fixing the maximum period for preventive deten tion In my opinion there is nothing in section which is outside the constitutional limits of the powers of the supreme legislature It has been enacted on the authority of clause of article and runs thus Any person detained in any of the following classes of cases or under any of the following circumstances may be detained without obtaining the opinion of <ORG> for a period longer than three months but not exceed ing one year from the date of his detention namely where such person has been detained with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to a the defence of India relations of India with for eign powers or the security of India or the security of a <ORG> or the maintenance of public order The case of every person detained under a detention order to which the provisions of sub section apply shall within a period of six months from the date of his detention be reviewed where the order was made by <ORG> or a State Government by such Govern ment and where the order was made by any officer specified in sub section of section a by <ORG> to which such officer is subordinate in consultation with a person who is or has been or is qualified to be appointed as a Judge of <ORG> nominated in that behalf by <ORG> or <ORG> as the case may be The section purports to comply with the conditions laid down in clause of article It was however argued that in substance and reality it has failed to comply with any of the conditions laid down therein that it neither mentions the circumstances under which nor the classes of cases in which preventive detention without recourse to the machinery of an advisory board could be permitted The crucial question for consideration is whether section mentions any circumstances under which or defined the class es of cases in which authority was conferred by clause to dispense with an advisory board It seems clear that the real purpose of clause was to provide for a contin gency where compulsory requirement of an advisory board may defeat the object of the law of preventive detention The authority to make such drastic legislation was entrusted to the supreme legislature but with the further safeguard that it can only enact a law of such a drastic nature provided it prescribed the circumstances under which such power had to be used or in the alternative it prescribed the classes of cases or stated a determinable group of cases in which this could be done In this connection it has to be remembered that the Constitution must have thought of really some abnormal situation and of some dangerous groups of persons when it found it necessary to dispense with a tribu nal like an advisory board which functions in camera and which is not bound even to give a personal hearing to the detenu and whose proceedings are privileged It was argued by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the phrase circumstances under which and the classes of cases in which used in clause had to be construed in a cumulative sense on the other hand the learned Attorney General contended that the word and had been used in this clause in the same sense as or In Full Bench Reference No of <NAME> of <ORG> held that the intention of the legislature in enacting the clause was that the law of preventive detention author izing detention for a longer period than three months with out the intervention of an advisory board had to fulfil both the requirements laid down in clause and not only one of the requirements in the alternative The same view has been expressed by my brother Sir <NAME> I share this view with him I would however like to consider this matter from a different aspect on the assumption that the contention raised by the learned Attorney General is right In such a situation the machinery of an advisory board could be dispensed with because it may become cumber some or it may hamper the exercise of necessary powers In this view of the matter I have no hesitation in holding that no circumstances have been stated in section though the section ostensibly says so If it was permissible to con jecture it seems that the draftsman of section repeated the words of clause of article without an applica tion of his mind to the meaning of those words and as the legislation was passed in haste to meet an emergent situa tion it suffers from the defects which all hasty legisla tion suffer from The question is whether it can be said that a mere selection of all or any of the categories of the subjects for reasons connected with which a law of preventive detention could be made under the th Schedule amounts to a classification of cases as contemplated in clause of article Clause of article enjoins in respect of all the six subjects that no law can provide for preventive deten tion for a longer period than three months without reference to an advisory board The normal procedure to be followed when detention is intended to be beyond a period of three months in respect of the six subjects is provided in sub clause The extraordinary and unusual procedure was intended to be adopted in certain abnormal cases for which provision could be made by a parliamentary statute under clause It seems to me however that section of Act IV of has reversed this process quite contrary to the intention of the Constitution By this section Act IV of has dispensed with the advisory board in five out of the six subjects above mentioned and the compulsory procedure of an advisory board laid down in clause of article has been relegated to one out of these six sub jects I am further of the opinion that the construction placed by the learned Attorney General on clause of article and adopted by the framers of Act IV of creates a very anomalous situation Suppose a tense situation arises and there is a danger of the railway system being sabotaged and it becomes necessary to pass detention orders against cer tain persons Could such an anomalous result be in the contempla tion of the framers of the Constitution The construction that I am inclined to place on the section is in accord with the scheme of the law of punitive detention Sections to deal with cases classified according to the gravity of the offence i cases of simple assault assault on a public servant assault on women assault in attempt to commit theft assault for wrongfully confining a person and assault on grave provocation have been separately grouped It can hardly be said that all cases of preventive detention for reasons connected with the maintenance of public order stand on the same footing in the degree of gravity and deserve the same duration of detention and all cases connected with the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the life of the community stand in the matter of their gravity on such a footing as to require a lenient treatment It is true that in a sense all persons who act prejudicially to the defence of India may be comprehensively said to form one group and similarly persons who act prejudicially to the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the life of the community may form another class but the question is whether it was in this comprehensive sense that classifica tion was intended by the Constitution in clause or was it intended in a narrower and restricted sense It has to be remembered that the law under clause was intended to provide detention for a longer period and such a law very seriously abridges personal liberty and in this situation giving a narrower and restricted meaning to this expression will be in accordance with well established canons of con struction of statutes For the reasons given above I am of the opinion that section of Act IV of does not fulfil the requirements of clause of article of the Constitution and is not a law which falls within the ambit of that clause There is no other provision in this law under which he can be detained for any period whatsoever I see no difficulty whatsoever if a serious effort was made to comply with the provisions of clause The Constitution must be taken to have furnished an adequate safeguard to its citi zens when it laid down certain conditions in clause and it could not be considered that it provided no safeguard to them at all and that the words used in clause were merely illusory and had no real meaning Section of Act IV of has been impugned on the ground that it contravenes and abridges the provisions of articles and of the Constitution This section is in these terms No <ORG> shall except for the purposes of a prose cution for an offence punishable under subsection allow any statement to be made or any evidence to be given before it of the substance of any communication made under section of the grounds on which a detention order has been made against any person or of any representation made by him against such order and notwithstanding anything con tained in any other law no <ORG> shall be entitled to require any public officer to produce before it or to disclose the substance of any such communication or repre sentation made or the proceedings of an advisory board or that part of the report of an advisory board which is confi dential It shall be an offence punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year or with fine or with both for any person to disclose or publish without the previous authorisation of <ORG> or <ORG> as the case may be any contents or matter purporting to be contents of any such communication or representation as is referred to in sub section Provided that nothing in this sub section shall apply to a disclosure made to his legal adviser by a person who is the subject of a detention order This section is in the nature of an iron curtain around the acts of the authority making the order of preventive detention The Constitution has guaranteed to the detained person the right to be told the grounds of detention He has been given a right to make a representation vide arti cle yet section prohibits the disclosure of the grounds furnished to him or the contents of the representa tion made by him in a Court of law and makes a breach of this injunction punishable with imprisonment Article of the Constitution is in these terms The right to move <ORG> by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of the rights conferred by this Part is guaranteed Sub section says The right guaranteed by this article shall not be suspended except as otherwise provided for by this Constitu tion Now it is quite clear that if an authority passes an order of preventive detention for reasons not connected with any of the six subjects mentioned in the th Schedule this <ORG> can always declare the detention illegal and release the detenu but it is not possible for this <ORG> to func tion if there is a prohibition against disclosing the grounds which have been served upon him This <ORG> would be disabled from exercis ing its functions under article and adjudicating on the point that the grounds given satisfy the requirements of the sub clause if it is not open to it to see the grounds that have been furnished This <ORG> would be entitled to examine the matter and to see whether the grounds furnished are the grounds on the basis of which he has been detained or they contain some other vague or irrelevant material The whole purpose of furnishing a detained person with the grounds is to enable him to make a representation refuting these grounds and of proving his innocence In order that this <ORG> may be able to safeguard this fundamental right and to grant him relief it is absolutely essential that the detenu is not prohibited under penalty of punishment to disclose the grounds to the <ORG> and no injunction by law can be issued to this <ORG> disabling it from having a look at the grounds Section creates a substantive offence if the grounds are disclosed and it also lays a duty on the <ORG> not to permit the disclosure of such grounds It virtually amounts to a suspension of a guaranteed right provided by the Constitution inasmuch as it indirectly by a stringent provision makes administration of the law by this <ORG> impossible and at the same time it deprives a detained person from obtaining justice from this <ORG> In my opin ion therefore this section when it prohibits the disclo sure of the grounds contravenes or abridges the rights given by Part III to a citizen and is ultra vires the powers of <ORG> to that extent The result of the above discussion is that in my opin ion sections and of Act IV of as above indicated are void and the decision of the detenu case has to be made by keeping out of sight these two provisions in the Act The statute has not provided for detention for a period of three months or less in such cases as it could have done under article of the Constitu tion and that being so the petitioner cannot be justifia bly detained even for a period of three months I would accordingly order his release In view of the decision above arrived at I do not con sider it necessary to express any opinion on the other points that were argued at great length before us namely what is the scope and true meaning of the expression procedure established by law in article of the Consti tution and what is the precise scope of articles and of the Constitution <NAME> an application under article of the Constitution praying for a writ of habeas corpus upon the respondents with a view to release the petitioner who it is alleged is being unlawfully detained in the Central Jail Cuddalore within the State of Madras While these criminal cases were going on he was served with an order of deten tion under the Madras Maintenance of Public Order Act on nd April This order of detention was held to be illegal by <ORG> but on the same day that the judgment was pronounced a second order of detention was served upon him On his moving <ORG> again for a writ of habeas corpus in respect to the subsequent order his application was dismissed on the ground that as he was not granted bail in one of the three criminal cases that were pending against him the detention could not be said to be unlawful Liberty however was given to him to renew his application if and when his detention under the criminal proceedings ceased The petitioner made a fresh application to <ORG> praying for a writ of habeas corpus in respect of his detention under the Madras Maintenance of Public Order Act and this application which was heard after he had served out his sentences of imprisonment referred to above was dismissed in January On th February the Preventive Detention Act was passed by the <ORG> and on the st of March follow ing the the detention of the applicant under the Madras Maintainance of Public Order Act was cancelled and he was served with a fresh order of detention under section of the Preventive Detention Act The position taken up on behalf of the petitioner on the other hand is that the said Act is invalid and ultra vires the conStitution by reason of its being in conflict with certain fundamental rights which are guaranteed by the Constitution It is argued therefore that the detention of the peti tioner is invalid and that he should be set at liberty The contentions that have been but forward by Mr <NAME> who appeared in support of the petition may be classi fied under four heads His first contention is that as preventive detention is in substance a restriction on the free movements of a person throughout the Indian territory it comes within the purview of article of Part III of the Constitution which lays down the fundamental rights This being the legal position the learned Counsel invites us to hold that the main provisions of the impugned Act particularly those which are contained in sections and are wholly unreasonable and should be invalidated on that ground The second contention advanced by the learned Counsel is that the impugned legislation is in conflict with the provi sion of article of the Constitution inasmuch as it pro vides for deprivation of the personal liberty of a man not in accordance with a procedure established by law It is argued that the word law here does not mean or refer to any particular legislative enactment but it means the gener al law of the land embodying those principles of natural justice with regard to procedure which are regarded as fundamental in all systems of civilised jurisprudence It is conceded by the learned counsel that the proce dure if any with regard to preventive detention as has been prescribed by article of the Constitution which itself finds a place in the chapter on Fundamental Rights must override those general rules of procedure which are contemplated by article but with regard to matters for which no provision is made in article the general provi sion made in article must apply The last argument in support of this application is that the provisions of sections and of the Preventive Deten tion Act are invalid as they take away and render completely nugatory the fundamental right to constitutional remedies as is provided for in article of the Constitution In this respect it has followed the American Constitution and other systems modelled on it Article is imperative on this point and provides expressly that the <ORG> shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the right conferred by this Part and any law made in contra vention of this clause shall to the extent of the contra vention be void Of the different classes of fundamental rights spoken of above we are concerned here primarily with right to freedom which is dealt with in four articles beginning from article and also with the right to constitutional remedy which is embodied in article Article enumerates certain forms of liberty or free dom the protection of which is guaranteed by the Constitu tion In article certain protections are given in cases of persons accused of criminal offences Article lays down in general terms that no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law The first contention advanced by Mr <NAME> involves a consideration of the question as to whether Preventive Detention which is the subject matter of the impugned legislative enactment comes within the purview of article of the Constitution according to which a right to move freely throughout the territory of India is one of the fundamental rights guaranteed to all citizens If it comes within that sub clause it is not disputed that clause of article would be attracted to it and it would be for the courts to decide whether the restrictions imposed upon this right by the <ORG> are reasonable restric tions and are within the permissible limits prescribed by clause of the article There is no authoritative definition of the term Pre ventive Detention in Indian law though as description of a topic of legislation it occurred in the Legislative Lists of the Government of India Act and has been used in Item of List I and Item of List III in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution The expression has its origin in the language used by Judges or the law Lords in England while explaining the nature of detention under Regulation of the Defence of Realm Consolidation Act passed on the outbreak of the First World War and the same lan guage was repeated in connection with the emergency regula tions made during the last World War The word preventive is used in contradistinction to the word punitive The object is not to punish a man for having done something but to intercept him before he does it and to prevent him from doing it This is undoubtedly unfortunate but it is not our business to speculate on questions of policy or to attempt to explore the reasons which led the representatives of our people to make such a drastic provision in the Constitution itself which cannot but be regarded as a most unwholesome encroachment upon the liberties of the people The detention of a man even as a precautionary measure certainly deprives him of his personal liberty and as article guarantees to every man be he a citizen or a foreigner that he shall not be deprived of his life and personal liberty except in accordance with the procedure established by law the requirements of article would certainly have to be complied with to make preventive detention valid in law It secures to all persons certain fundamental rights in relation to arrest and detention and as already said by way of exception to the rights thus declared makes certain specific provisions relating to preventive deten tion Clause of article expressly enjoins that the protec tive provisions of clauses and of the article would not be available to persons detained under any law providing for preventive detention The only fundamental rights which are guaranteed by the Constitution in the matter of preven tive detention and which to that extent impose restraints upon the exercise of legislative powers in that respect are Vide Lord Macmillan in Liversidge Anderson A at Clause lays down that no law of preventive detention shall autho rise the detention of a person for a period longer than three months unless an advisory board constituted in the manner laid down in sub clause a of the clause has report ed before the expiration of the period that there is suffi cient cause for such detention The <ORG> is also given the authority to prescribe the circumstances and the class of cases under which a person can be detained for a period longer than three months under any law of preventive detention without obtaining the opin ion of the advisory board There is one safeguard provided for all cases which is contained in clause and which lays down that the authority making the order of detention shall as soon as possible communicate to such person the grounds on which the order has been made and shall afford him the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order The question that we have to consider is whether a law relating to preventive detention is justiciable in a <ORG> of law on the ground of reasonableness under article of the Constitution inasmuch as it takes away or abridges the right to free movement in the territory of India guaran teed by clause of the article It will be seen from what has been said above that article deals specifically with the subject of preventive detention and expressly takes away the fundamental rights relating to arrest and detention enumerated in clauses and of the article from per sons who are detained under any law which may be passed by the <ORG> or <ORG> acting under article of the Constitution read with the relevant items in the legislative lists I will leave aside for the moment the question as to how far the court can examine the reasonable ness or otherwise of the procedure that is prescribed by any law relating to preventive detention for that would involve a considera tion of the precise scope and meaning of article but this much is beyond controversy that so far as substantive law is concerned article of the Constitution gives a clear authority to the legislature to take away the funda mental rights relating to arrest and detention which are secured by the first two clauses of the article Any legis lation on the subject would only have to conform to the requirements of clauses to and provided that is done there is nothing in the language employed nor in the context in which it appears which affords any ground for suggestion that such law must be reasonable in its character and that it would be reviewable by the <ORG> on that ground Both articles and occur in the same Part of the Con stitution and both of them purport to lay down the fundamen tal rights which the Constitution guarantees It is well settled that the Constitution must be interpreted in a broad and liberal manner giving effect to all its parts and the presumption should be that no conflict or repugnancy was intended by its framers In interpreting the words of a Constitution the same principles undoubtedly apply which are applicable in construing a statute but as was observed by Lord <NAME> in <NAME> Commonwealth of Australia the ultimate result must be determined upon the actual words used not in vacuo but as occurring in a single complex instrument in which one part may throw light on the other The Constitution his Lordship went on saying has been described as the federal compact and the construction must hold a balance between all its parts It seems to me that there is no conflict or repugnancy between the two provisions of the Constitution and an exami nation of the scheme and language of the catena of articles which deal with the rights to freedom would be sufficient to show that what clause of article contemplates is not freedom from detention either punitive or preventive it relates to and speaks of a different aspect or phase of civil liberty The object of the framers of the Constitution obviously is to enumerate and guarantee those forms of liberty which come under well known categories recognised by constitutional writers and are considered to be fundamental and of vital importance to the community There cannot be any such thing as absolute or uncon trolled liberty wholly freed from restraint for that would lead to anarchy and disorder The possession and enjoyment of all rights as was observed by <ORG> in <NAME> Massachusetts are subject to such reasonable conditions as may be deemed by the governing authority of the country essential to the safety health peace general order and morals of the community The question therefore arises in each case of adjusting the conflicting interests of the individual and of the society Ordinarily every man has the liberty to order his life as he pleases to say what he will to go where he will to follow any trade occupation or calling at his pleasure and to do any other thing which he can lawfully do without let or hindrance by any other person punish those who break the law The police may arrest any man and throw him into prison without assigning any reasons they may search his belongings on the slightest pretext he may be subjected to a sham trial and even pun ished for crimes unknown to law To me it seems that article of the Constitution gives a list of individual liberties and prescribes in the various clauses the restraints that may be placed upon them by law so that they may not conflict with public welfare or general morality On the other hand articles and are primarily concerned with penal enactments or other laws under which personal safety or liberty of persons could be taken away in the interests of the society and they set down the limits within which the <ORG> control should be exer cised Article uses the expression freedom and men tions the several forms and aspects of it which are secured to individuals together with the limitations that could be placed upon them in the general interests of the society The essence of these rights consists in restraining others from interfering with them and hence they cannot be described in terms of freedom to do particular things There is also no question of imposing limits on the activities of individuals so far as the exer cise of these rights is concerned In my opinion the group of articles to embody the entire protection guaranteed by the Constitution in relation to deprivation of life and personal liberty both with regard to substantive as well as to procedural law There must be a substantive law under which the <ORG> is empow ered to deprive a man of his life and personal liberty and such law must be a valid law which the legislature is compe tent to enact within the limits of the powers assigned to it and which does not transgress any of the fundamental rights that the Constitution lays down These are the protections provided for by article Again a law providing for arrest and detention must conform to the limitations prescribed by clauses and of article These provisions indeed have been withdrawn expressly in case of preventive detention and protections of much more feeble and attenuated character have been substi tuted in their place but this is a question of the policy adopted by the Constitution which does not concern us at all The position therefore is that with regard to life and personal liberty the Constitution guarantees protection to this extent that no man could be deprived of these rights except under a valid law passed by a competent legislature within the limits mentioned above and in accordance with the procedure which such law lays down Article on the other hand enunciates certain particular forms of civil liberty quite independently of the rights dealt with under article Most of them may be connected with or dependent upon person al liberty but are not identical with it and the purpose of article is to indicate the limits within which the <ORG> could by legislation impose restrictions on the exercise of these rights by the individuals The reasonableness or otherwise of such legislation can indeed be determined by the <ORG> to the extent laid down in the several clauses of article though no such review is permissible with regard to laws relating to deprivation of life and personal liber ty We find the rights relating to personal liberty being de clared almost in the same terms in the Irish Consti tution article of which lays down that no citizen shall be deprived of his personal liberty save in accordance with law In the Constitution of the Free City of Danzig the liberty of the person has been declared to be inviolable and no limitation or deprivation of personal liberty may be imposed by public authority except by virtue of a law vide article This is the scheme adopted by the Constitution in dealing with the rights to freedom described in the chapter on fundamental rights and in my opinion therefore the proper test for determining the validity of an enactment under which a person is sought to be deprived of his life and personal liberty has to be found not in article but in the three following articles of the Constitution Article of course has no application so far as the law relating to preventive detention is concerned Mr <NAME> endeavour throughout has been to establish that article of the Constitution read with article enunciates the fundamental rights of the citizens regarding the substantive law of personal liberty while article embodies the protection as regards proce dural law It cannot also be said that the provisions of article read with clause and article are complementary to each other There is no mention of any right to life in article although that is the primary and the most important thing for which provision is made in article In the second place even if freedom of movement may be regarded as one of the ingredients of personal liberty surely there are other elements included in the concept and admittedly no provision for other forms of personal liberty are to be found in article of the Constitution Furthermore article is applicable to citizens only while the rights guaranteed by article are for all per sons The only proper way of avoiding these anomalies is to interpret the two provisions as applying to different subjects and this would be the right conclusion if we have in mind the scheme which under lies this group of articles Article provides that all citizens shall have the right to move freely throughout the territory of India Clause relates to all these three sub clauses and lays down that nothing in them shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposes or prevent the <ORG> from making any law imposing reasonable restrictions on the exercise of any of the rights conferred by the said sub clause either in the interests of the general public or for the protection of the interests of any scheduled tribe I agree with the learned Attorney General that in con struing article stress is to be laid upon the expression throughout the territory of India and it is a particular and special kind of right viz In the next sub clause right tO reside and settle in any part of the territory of India is given and here again the material thing is not the right of residence or settlement but the right to reside or settle in any part of the Indian territo ry For an analogous provision we may refer to article which says that subject to the other provisions of this Part commerce and intercourse throughout the territory of India shall be free The meaning of sub clause of arti cle will be clear if we take it along with sub clauses and all of which have been lumped together in clause and to all of which the same restrictions including those relating to protecion of the interest of any scheduled tribe have been made applicable Normally all citizens would have the free right to move from one part of the Indian territory to another So far as free movement throughout the territory is concerned the right is subject to the provision of clause under which reasonable limitation may be imposed upon these liberties in the interests of the general public or protection of any scheduled tribe In addition to general interest the Constitu tion has specified the protection of the interests of the scheduled tribes as one of the factors which has got to be taken into consideration in the framing of these restric tions Hence there are various provisions disabling them from alienating even their own properties except under special conditions In their interest and for their benefit laws may be made restricting the ordinary right of citizens to go or settle in particular areas or acquire property in them The refer ence to the interest of scheduled tribe makes it quite clear that the free movement spoken of in the clause relates not to general rights of locomotion but to the particular right of shifting or moving from one part of the Indian territory to another without any sort of discriminatory barriers This view will receive further support if we look to some analogous provisions in the Constitution of other countries The article runs as follows All nationals shall enjoy freedom of movement within the free city and shall have the right to stay and to settle at any place they may choose to acquire real property and to earn their living in any way Every one has the right to stay in any part of the Realm that he chooses settle there acquire landed property and pursue any means of livelihood Here again the right to personal liberty has been dealt with separately in article A suggestion was made in course of our discussions that the expression throughout the territory of India occurring in article might have been used with a view to save Passport Regulations or to emphasise that no rights of free emigration are guaran teed by the Constitution The suggestion does not seem to me to be proper Further it seems to me that the words throughout the territory of India have nothing to do with rights of emigration We find that both in the Danzig as well as in the German Constitution where similar words have been used with regard to the excercise of the right of free movement throughout the territory there are specific provisions which guarantee to all nationals the free right of emigration to other coun tries vide article of the Danzig Constitution and arti cle of the Constitution of the German Reich In my opinion therefore preventive detention does not come either within the express language or within the spirit and intendment of clause of article of the Constitu tion which deals with a totally different aspect or form of civil liberty Thus a detenu so long as he is under detention may not be able to practise any profession or carry on any trade or business which he might like to do but this would not make the law providing for preventive detention a legislation taking away or abridging the rights under article of the Constitution and it would be absurd to suggest that in such cases the validity of the legislation should be tested in accordance with the requirement of clause of article and that the only restrictions that could be placed upon the person free exercise of trade and profession are those specified in that clause Mr <NAME> concedes that in such cases we must look to the substance of the particular legis lation and the mere fact that it incidentally trenches upon some other right to which it does not directly relate is not material The learned counsel refers in this connection to certain passages in <NAME> Commentaries on the Laws of Eng land where the author discusses what he calls the three absoluterights inherent in every Englishman namely rights of personal security personal liberty and property Personal security according to <NAME> consists in a person legal and uninterrupted enjoyment of his life his limb his body his health and his reputation whereas personal liberty consists in the power of locomotion of changing of situation or moving one person to whatsoever place one own inclination may direct without imprisonment or restraint unless by due course of law A much wider and larger connotation is given to it by later writers on con stitutional documents particularly in America In ordinary language personal liberty means liberty relating to or concerning the person or body of the individual and per sonal liberty in this sense is the antithesis of physical restraint or coercion According to <NAME> who is an acknowledged authority on the subject personal liberty means a personal right not to be subjected to imprisonment arrest or other physical coercion in any manner that does not admit of legal justification It is in my opinion this negative right of not being subjected to any form of physical restraint or coercion that constitutes the essence of personal liberty and not mere freedom to move to any part of the Indian territory point out that it was in accordance with the recommendation of the Drafting Committee that the word personal was inserted before liberty in article of the Constitution which now stands as article In the report of <ORG> it is stated that the word liberty should be quali fied by the insertion of the word personal before it otherwise it might be construed very widely so as to in clude even the freedoms already dealt with in article from the concept of personal liberty as used in article It is enough to say at this stage that if the report of the <ORG> is an appropriate material upon which the interpretation of the words of the Constitution could be based it certainly goes against the contention of the applicant and it shows that the words used in article of the Constitution do not mean the same thing as the expression personal liberty in article does It is well known that the word liberty standing by itself has been given a very wide meaning by <ORG> of the United States of America It includes not only personal freedom from physical restraint but the right to the free use of one own property and to enter into free contractual relations In the Indian Constitution on the other hand the expression personal liberty has been deliberately used to restrict it to freedom from physical restraint of person by incarceration or otherwise On the other hand the right to hold and dispose of property which is in subclause of article and which is not dependent on full possession of personal liberty by the owner may not be affected if the owner is imprisoned or detained The result is that in my opinion the first contention raised by Mr <NAME> cannot succeed and it must be held that we are not entitled to examine the reasonableness or otherwise of the Preventive Detention Act and see whether it is within the permissible bounds specified in clause of article I now come to the second point raised by Mr <NAME> in support of the application and upon this point we had arguments of a most elaborate nature addressed to us by the learned counsel on both sides displaying a considerable amount of learning and research personal liberty except according to procedure established by law The position taken up by the learned Attorney General is that as in the present case there is no doubt about the competency of that <ORG> to enact the law relating to preventive detention which is fully covered by Item of List I and Item of List III and as no question of the law being reasonable or otherwise arises for consideration by reason of the fact that article is not attracted to this case the law must be held to be a valid piece of legisla tion and if the procedure laid down by it has been adhered to the validity of the detention cannot possibly be challenged The expression law in this context does not mean or signify according to the learned counsel any particular law enacted by the legislature in conformity with the requirements of the Constitu tion or otherwise possessing a binding authority It refers to law in the abstract or general sense in the sense of jus and not lex and meaning thereby the legal principles or fundamental rules that lie at the root of every system of positive law including our own and the authority of which is acknowledged in the jurisprudence of all civilised coun tries It may be noted here that in the original draft of the Indian Constitution the words used in article which now stands as article were in accordance with due process of law <ORG> recommended that in place of the due process clause the expression according to procedure established by law should be substituted The present article seems to have been modeled on article of the Japanese Constitution where the language employed is no person shall be deprived of life or liberty nor shall any other criminal penalty be imposed except according to procedure established by law Mr <NAME> argues that the expression procedure established by law in article of the Constitution bears the same meaning as the due process clause does in America restricted only to this extent viz To appre ciate the arguments that have been advanced for and against this view and to fix the precise meaning that is to be given to this clause in article it would be necessary to discuss briefly the conception of the doctrine of due process of law as it appears in the American Constitution and the way in which it has been developed and applied by <ORG> Neither of these phrases was explained or defined in any of the documents but on the authority of Sir <NAME> it may be said that both the expressions have the same meaning In substance they guaranteed that persons should not be imprisoned without proper indictment and trial by peers and that property should not be seized except in proceedings conducted in due form in which the owner or the person in possession should have an opportunity to show cause why seizure should not be made The expression in one form or other appeared in some of the earlier State Constitutions and the exact phrase due process of law came to be a part of the Federal Constitution by the Fifth Amendment which was adopted in and which provided that no person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law It was imposed upon the State Constitution in almost identical language by the Fourteenth Amendment in the year What due process of law exactly means is difficult to define even at the present day The Constitution contains no description of what is due process of law nor does it declare the principles by application of which it could be ascertained The meaning is that every citizen shall hold his life liberty property and immunities under the protection of the general rules which govern society Some Judges seem to have alluded to the principles of natural justice in ex plaining what is meant by general law or law of the land though the doctrine of a law of nature did not obtain a firm footing at any time <NAME> dictum of a supreme fundamental law which obviously referred to principles of English common law cer tainly did exercise considerable influence upon the minds of the American Judges and there are observations in some cases <ORG> case <ORG> In the case of <ORG> Topeka it was observed that there are limitations upon powers of Government which grow out of the essential nature of free Governments implied reservations of individual rights without which the social compact could not exist and which are respected by all Governments entitled to the name What is hinted at is undoubtedly the old idea of a social com pact under which political institutions were supposed to come into being and the suggestion is that when the Ameri cans formed themselves into a <ORG> by surrendering a por tion of their rights which they possessed at that time and which presumably they inherited from their English ancestors there were certain rights of a fundamental character still reserved by them which no <ORG> could possibly take away In the actual application of the clause relating to due process of law to particular cases the decisions of <ORG> present certain peculiar and unusu al features and there is total lack of uniformity and consistency in them Some of them seem to have been ill advised and arbitrary and there was a clamour amongst businessmen against what they described as legislative encroachments upon their vested private rights <ORG> now began to use the rule of due process of law as a direct restraint upon substantial legislation and any statute or administrative act which imposed a limitation upon rights of private property or free contractual relations between the employers and employed was invalidated as not being in accordance with due process of law In that case the question arose as to the validity of a labour legislation which prohibited the employment of persons in certain fields of activity for more than hours a week The <ORG> by a majority of to held the statute to be invalid on the ground that the right to purchase or sell labour is part of the liberty protected by the Amendment unless there are circumstances which excluded the right It may be mentioned here that while the due process doctrine was being extended by judicial pronouncements the doctrine of police power which operates to some extent as a check upon the due process clause was simultaneously gaining importance Roughly speaking police power may be defined as a right of a <ORG> to regulate the conduct of its people in the interests of public safety health morals and convenience Under this authority a <ORG> may make regulations concerning the safety of building the regulation of traffic the reporting of incurable diseases the inspection of markets the sanitation of factories the hours of work for women Vide Kelley and <NAME> on the American Constitution In the case of <ORG> Parrish which related to the legality of a Statute for regulating the minimum wages of women Chief Justice Hughes who delivered the opinion of the <ORG> observed as follows In each case the violation alleged by those attack ing minimum wage regulation for women is deprivation of freedom of contract But the liberty safeguarded is liberty in a social organisation which requires the protection of law The judicial pronouncements are not guided by any uniform principle and the economic and social ideas of the Judges who form the majority in <ORG> for the time being constitute so to say the yard stick for measuring the reasonableness or otherwise of any enactment passed during that period No writer of American Constitutional Law has been able uptil now to evolve anything like a definite and consistent set of prin ciples out of the large mass of cases where the doctrine of due process of law has been invoked or applied In the Draft Constitution article which now stands as article was apparently framed on the basis of the th and th Amendments in the American Constitution The article was worded as follows No person shall be deprived of his life or liberty without due process of law The first sugges tion was that the word personal shall be inserted before the word liberty and the second was that the expression in accordance with procedure established by law shall be substituted for due process of law the reason given being that the former expression was more specific The learned Attorney General has placed before us the debates in <ORG> centering round the adoption of this recommendation of <ORG> and he has referred us to the Swisher The Growth of Constitutional Power in the United States pp speeches of several members of the <ORG> who played an important part in the shaping of the Constitution As an aid to discover the meaning of the words in a Consti tution these debates are of doubtful value The learned Attorney General concedes that these debates are not admissible to explain the meaning of the words used and he wanted to use them only for the purpose of showing that the Constituent <ORG> when they finally adopted the recommendation of <ORG> were fully aware of the implications of the differences between the old form of expression and the new I have no doubt in my mind that if the due process clause which appeared in the original draft was finally retained by <ORG> it could be safely presumed that the framers of the Indian Vide Willoughby on the Constitution of the United States But when that form was abandoned and another was deliberately substituted in its place it is not possible to say that in spite of the difference in the language and expression they should mean the same thing and convey the same idea Mr <NAME> contention is that in view of the somewhat uncertain and fluidic state of law as prevails in America on the subject <ORG> recommended an alteration for the purpose of making the language more specific and he would have us hold that it was made specific in this way namely that instead of being extended over the whole sphere of law substantive as well as adjective it was limited to procedural law mere ly That is the reason he says why instead of the word process the expression procedure was adopted but the word law means the same thing as it does in the due process clause in America and refers not to any <ORG> made law but to the fundamental principles which are inherent in the legal system and are based upon the immutable doctrines of natural justice They wanted to make the provision clear definite and precise and deliberately chose the words procedure established by law as in their opinion no doubts would ordinarily arise about the meaning of this expression This theory the Indian Constitu tion deliberately discarded and that is why they substituted a different form in its place which according to them was more specific In the second place it appears to me that when the same words are not used it will be against the ordinary canons of con struction to interpret a provision in our Constitution in accordance with the interpretation put upon a somewhat analogous provision in the Constitution of another country where not only the language is different but the entire political conditions and constitutional set up are dissimi lar In <ORG> stress has been laid uniformly upon the word due which occurs before and quali fies the expression process of law The word estab lished ordinarily means fixed or laid down and if law means as Mr <NAME> contends not any particular piece of law but the indefinite and indefinable principles of natural justice which underlie positive systems of law it would not at all be appropriate to use the expression established for natural law or natural justice cannot establish anything like a definite procedure It does not appear that in any part of the Constitution the word law has been used in the sense of general law connoting what has been described as the principles of natural justice outside the realm of positive law the Indian Constitution reproduces save in one particular the language of article of the Japanese Constitution and it is quite clear from the scheme and provisions of the Japa nese Constitution that in speaking of law it refers to law passed or recognised as such by the <ORG> In the Irish Constitution also there is provision in almost similar language which conveys the same idea Article provides that no citizen shall be deprived of his personal liberty save in accordance with law and by law is certain ly meant the law of the <ORG> No question of passing any law abridging the right conferred by this article could possibly arise and article of the Constitution would have no operation so far as this provision is concerned To quote the words of an American Judge it would sound very much like the Constitution speaking to the legislature that the latter could not infringe the right created by these articles unless it chose to do so Thus article provides No person shall be denied the right of access to the Courts These protections indeed have been denied to cases of preventive detention but that again is a question of policy which does not concern us as a <ORG> My conclusion therefore is that in article the word law has been used in the sense of <ORG> made law and not as an equivalent of law in the abstract or general sense embodying the principles of natural justice In the view that I have taken the question raised by Mr <NAME> that the Preventive Detention Act is invalid by reason of the fact that the procedure it lays down is not in conformity with the rules of natural justice does not fall for consideration It is enough in my opin ion if the law is a valid law which the legislature is competent to pass and which does not transgress any of the fundamental rights declared in Part III of the Constitution On the third point raised by Mr <NAME> the only question therefore which requires consideration is whether section of the Preventive Detention Act is ultra vires of the Constitution by reason of its being not in conformity with the provision of article a Article a of the Constitution empowers the <ORG> to prescribe the circumstances under which and the class or classes of cases in which a person may be detained for a period longer than three months under any law providing for preventive detention without obtaining the opinion of an advisory board in accordance with the provisions of sub clause a of clause Section of the Preventive Detention Act which purports to be an enact ment in pursuance of article a of the Constitution provides as follows Any person detained in any of the following classes of cases or under any of the following circumstances may be detained without obtaining the opinion of an advisory board for a period longer than three months but not exceeding one year from the date of his detention namely where such person has been detained with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to a the defence of India relations of India with for eign powers or the security of India or the security of a <ORG> or the maintenance of public order It will be noticed that there are altogether six heads or subjects in the two Items in the legislative lists namely Item No of List I and Item No of List III which deal with preventive detention Item No of List I mentions reasons connected with defence foreign affairs and security of India while Item No of List III speaks of reasons connected with security of a State the maintenance of public order and the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community Mr <NAME> argument is that the mentioning of five out of the six legislative heads in section does not amount to prescribing the circumstances under which or the classes of cases in which a person could be detained for more than three months as contemplated by article a I must say that section has been drafted in a rather clumsy manner and certainly it could have been framed in a better and more proper way Preventive detention can be provided for by law for reasons connected with six different matters specified in the relevant items in the legislative lists and whatever the reasons might be there is a provision contained in article a which lays down that deten tion for more than three months could not be permitted except with the sanction of the advisory board An alterna tive however has been provided for by clause and Parlia ment has been given the option to take away the protection given by clause a and specify the circumstances and the cases when this rule will not apply I am extremely doubt ful whether the classification of cases made by <ORG> in section of the Act really fulfils the object which the Constitution had in view The basis of classification has been the apprehended acts of the persons detained described with reference to the general heads mentioned in the items in the legislative lists as said above The Constitution has given unfettered powers to <ORG> in the matter of making the classifications and it is open to the <ORG> to adopt any method or principle as it likes Where an optional power is conferred on certain authority to perform two separate acts ordinarily it would not be obligatory upon it to perform both it may do either if it so likes Here the classes have been specified and the classes apparently are composed of persons who are detained for the purpose of preventing them from committing certain apprehended acts It is said that the likelihood of these persons committing the particular acts which are specified might constitute circumstances As I have said at the beginning the draft is rather clumsy and I do not know why <ORG> used the word or when in the Constitution itself the word and has been used Subsection of section prohibits any <ORG> from allowing any statement to be made or any evidence to be given before it of the substance of any communication made under section of the grounds on which a detention order has been made against any person or any representation made by him against such order Sub section further provides that It shall be an offence punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year or with fine or with both for any person to disclose or publish without the previous authorisation of <ORG> or <ORG> as the case may be any contents or matter purporting to be contents of any such communication or representation as is referred to in sub section Provided that nothing in this sub section shall apply to a disclosure made to his legal adviser by a person who is the subject of a detention order It imposes a ban on the <ORG> and pre vents it from allowing any statement to be made or any evidence produced before it of the substance of any communi cation made to the detenu apprising him of the grounds upon which the detention order was made Further the disclosure of such materials has been made a criminal offence punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year Mr <NAME> contention is that these restrictions render utterly nugatory the provi sions of article of the Constitution which guarantees to every person the right to move this <ORG> by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of the rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution It is not disputed that the petitioner has the right of moving this <ORG> for a writ of habeas corpus and unless the <ORG> is in a position to look into and examine the grounds upon which the detention order has been made it is impossible for it to come to any deci sion on the point and pass a proper judgment Though the right to move this <ORG> is not formally taken away the entire proceedings are rendered ineffective and altogether illusory On behalf of the respondent it is pointed out that article guarantees only the right to constitutional remedy for enforcement of the rights which are declared by the Constitution If there are no rights under the Constitution guaranteed to a person who is detained under any law of preventive deten tion no question of enforcing such rights by an ap proach to this <ORG> at all arises I do not think that this argument proceeds on a sound basis and in my opinion section does take away and materially curtails some of the fundamental rights which are guaranteed by the Constitu tion itself Article clause of the Constitution lays down as a fundamental right that when a person is detained for preventive detention the authority making the order shall as soon as may be communicate to such person the grounds on which the order has been made and shall afford him the earliest opportunity of making a representa tion against the order It is also incumbent upon the detaining authori ty to afford a detenu the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the detention order It has been held in several cases and in my opinion quite rightly that if the grounds supplied to a detained person are of such a vague and indefinite character that no proper and adequate representation could be made in reply to the same that itself would be an infraction of the right which has been given to the detenu under law These rights of the detenu would for all practical purposes be rendered unenforceable if the <ORG> is precluded from look ing into the grounds which have been supplied to him under section of the Preventive Detention Act In my opinion section of the Preventive Detention Act does materially affect the fundamental rights declared under Part III of the Constitution and for this reason it must be held to be illegal and ultra vires It is not disputed however that this section can be severed from the rest of the Act without affecting the other provisions of the Act in any way As has been pointed out already this <ORG> cannot interfere unless it is proved that the power has been exercised by the authorities in a mala fide manner or that the grounds are not proper or relevant grounds which justify detention The result therefore is that in my opinion the Preventive Detention Act must be declared to be intra vires the Constitution with the exception of section which is held to be illegal and ultra vires The present petition however must stand dismissed though it may be open to the petitioner to make a fresh application if he so chooses and if the grounds that have been supplied to him under section of the Act do furnish adequate reasons for making such application The contention of learned counsel appearing in support of this application is that the provisions of the Preventive Detention Act Act IV of are extremely drastic and wholly unreasonable and take away or in any event considerably abridge the fundamental rights conferred on the citizens by the provisions of Part III of the Constitution and that this Court should declare the Act wholly void under article of the Constitution and set the petitioner at liberty In England <ORG> is supreme and there is no limitation upon its legislative powers The English <ORG>s have to interpret and apply the law they have no authority to declare such a law illegal or unconstitutional By the American Constitution the legislative power of the Union is vested in the <ORG> and in a sense the <ORG> is the supreme legislative power As will be seen more fully hereafter the Supreme <ORG> of the United States under the leadership of Chief Justice <NAME> assumed the power to The point to be noted however is that in so far as there is any limitation on the legislative power the <ORG> must on a complaint being made to it scrutinise and ascertain whether such limitation has been transgressed and if there has been any transgression the <ORG> will courageously declare the law unconstitution al for the <ORG> is bound by its oath to uphold the Consti tution But outside the limitations imposed on the legisla tive powers our <ORG> and the State <ORG> are supreme in their respective legislative fields and the <ORG> has no authority to question the wisdom or policy of the law duly made by the appropriate legislature Our Constitution unlike the English Constitution recognises the <ORG> supremacy over the legislative authority but such supremacy is a very limited one for it is confined to the field where the legislative power is circumscribed by limitations put upon it by the Constitution itself But our Constitu tion unlike the American Constitution does not recognise the absolute supremacy of the <ORG> over the legislative authority in all respects for outside the restricted field of constitutional limitations our <ORG> and the State <ORG> are supreme in their respective legislative fields and in that wider field there is no scope for the <ORG> in India to play the role of the Supreme <ORG> of the United States The impugned Act has been passed by <ORG> after the Constitution came into force Article gives exclusive power to <ORG> to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I in the Seventh Schedule and it gives exclusive power to the State Legislatures to make laws with respect to any of the matters specified in List II of that Schedule It also gives concurrent power to <ORG> as well as to the State Legislatures to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List III in the Seventh Schedule The first thing to note is that under Entry of List I the parliament and under Entry in List III both parliament and the State <ORG> are empowered to make laws for preventive detention for reasons connected with the several matters specified in the respective entries There is no such provision in the Constitution of any other country that I know of Be that as it may for reasons good or bad our Constitution has deliberately and plainly given power to <ORG> and the State <ORG> to enact preventive detention laws even in peacetime The next thing to bear in mind is that if there were nothing else in the Constitution the legislative powers of <ORG> and <ORG> in their respective fields would have been absolute stepped its legislative field and en croached upon the legislative field of the other legislative power but could not have otherwise questioned the validity of any law made by the parliament or <ORG> This law might not have made any provision for supplying to the detenu the grounds of his detention or affording any opportunity to him to make any representation to anybody or for setting up any advisory board at all Under Entry of List I the <ORG> might have made a law for acquiring anybody properties for the purposes of the Union without any compensation and under Entry in List III <ORG> could do the same subject to the provisions of Entry in List III which empowers the making of a law laying down principles for payment of compensation which might be anything above noth ing Under Entry <ORG> could have made any law restricting or even prohibiting inter State migration so that a Bengali would not be able to move into and settle in Bihar or vice versa It is needless to multiply instances of atrocious laws which <ORG> or <ORG> might have made under article read with the different lists if there were nothing else in the Constitution Thus by article the legislative power is definitely made subject to the provisions of this Constitution Turning to the Constitution article provides as follows The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this Part and any law made in contravention of this clause shall to the extent of the contravention be void This clearly puts a definite limitation on the wide legislative powers given by article From the provisions so far referred to it clearly follows that there are two principal limitations to the legislative power of parliament namely i that the law must be within the legislative compe tence of parliament as prescribed by article and ii that such law must be subject to the pro visions of the Constitution and must not take away or abridge the rights conferred by Part III Civil rights of a person are generally divided into two classes namely the rights attached to the person jus personarum and the rights to things i property jus rerum Of the rights attached to the person the first and foremost is the freedom of life which means the right to live i the right that one life shall not be taken away except under authority of law If a man person is free it is then and then only that he can exercise a variety of other auxiliary rights that is to say he can within certain limits speak what he likes assemble where he likes form any associations or unions move about freely as his own inclination may direct reside and settle anywhere he likes and practise any profession or carry on any occupation trade or business It should be clearly borne in mind that these are not all the rights attached to the person Besides them there are varieties of other rights which are also the attributes of the freedom of the person Said <NAME> in Book III Ch of his Spirit of the Laws In Governments that is in societies directed by laws liberty can consist only in the power of doing what we ought to will and in not being constrained to do what we ought not to will Social interest in individu al liberty may well have to be subordinated to other greater social interests As will be seen more fully hereafter our Constitution has recognised personal liberties as fundamental rights It has put checks on the <ORG> legislative powers by articles and Article is in the following terms All citizens shall have the right a to freedom of speech and expression to assemble peaceably and without arms to form associations or unions to move freely throughout the territory of India to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India to acquire hold and dispose of property and to practise any profession or to carry on any occupation trade or business It will be noticed that of the seven rights protected by clause of article six of them namely a and are what are said to be rights at tached to the person jus personarum If there were nothing else in article these rights would have been absolute rights and the protection given to them would have completely debarred parliament or any of <ORG> from making any law taking away or abridging any of those rights Those clauses save the power of the <ORG> to make laws imposing certain specified restrictions on the several rights The nett result is that the unlimit ed legislative power given by article read with the different legislative lists in the Seventh Schedule is cut down by the provisions of article and all laws made by the <ORG> with respect to these rights must in order to be valid observe these limitations Whether any law has in fact transgressed these limitations is to be ascertained by the <ORG> and if in its view the restrictions imposed by the law are greater than what is permitted by clauses to whichever is applicable the <ORG> will declare the same to be unconstitutional and therefore void under article Here again there is scope for the application of the intel lectual yardstick of the <ORG> If however the <ORG> finds on scrutiny that the law has not overstepped the constitutional limitations the <ORG> will have to uphold the law whether it likes the law or not The first part of the argument is put broadly namely that personal liberty is generally guaranteed by the Consti tution by article and that the Preventive Detention Act has imposed unreasonable restrictions thereon in violation of the provisions of clauses to of that article If personal liberty as such is guaranteed by any of the sub clauses of article then why has it also been protected by article The answer suggested by learned counsel for the petitioner is that personal liberty as a substantive right is protected by article and article gives only an additional protection by prescrib ing the procedure according to which that right may be taken away Further what has been called the procedural protection of article would be an act of supererogation for when God takes away one life whatever opportunity He may have had given to Adam to explain his conduct before sending him down He is not likely in these degenerate days to observe the requirements of notice or fair trial before any human tribunal said to be required by article There is no reason why our Constitution should not do the same The truth is that article has given that protection to life as a substan tive right and that as will be seen hereafter that article properly understood does not purport to prescribe any par ticular procedure at all The further astounding result of the argument of counsel for the petitioner will be that the citizen of India will have only the rights enumerated in article clause and no other right attached to his person As I have already stated besides the several rights mentioned in the several sub clauses of article there are many other personal liberties which a free man i a man who has the freedom of his person may exercise Some of those other rights have been referred to by <NAME> of Calcutta in his unreported judgment in Miscellaneous Case No of <NAME> The Chief Secretary of West Bengal while referring the case to a Full Bench in the following words It must be remembered that a free man has far more and wider rights than those stated in article of the Constitution If freedom of person was the result of article then a free man would only have the seven rights mentioned in that article But obviously the free man in India has far greater rights I find myself in complete agreement with the learned Chief Justice on this point I cannot accept that our Constitution intended to give no protection to the bundle of rights which together with the rights mentioned in sub clauses a to and make up personal liberty In deed I regard it as a merit of our Constitution that it does not attempt to enumerate exhaustively all the personal rights but uses the compendious expression personal liber ty in article and protects all of them If it were permissible to refer to <ORG> report it would be anoth er answer to the contentions of learned counsel for the petitioner that personal liberty as a substantive right was protected by article I do not however desire to base my judgment on <ORG> report and I express no opinion as to its admissibility Whatever the intentions of <ORG> might have been the Constitution as finally passed has in article used the words personal liberty which have a definite connotation in law as I have explained It does not mean only liberty of the person but it means liberty or the rights attached to the person jus personarum The expressions freedom of life or personal liberty are not to be found in article and it is strain ing the language of article to squeeze in personal liber ty into that article In any case the right to life cannot be read into article Article being confined in its operation to citizens only a non citizen will have no protection for his life and personal liberty except what has been called the procedural protection of article If there be no substantive right what will the procedure protect I recognise that it is not imperative that a foreigner should have the same privileges as are given to a citizen but if article is construed in the way I have suggested even a foreigner will have equal protection for his life and personal liberty before the laws of our country under our Constitution Reference is made to the unreported dissenting judgment of Sen <NAME> of Calcutta in Miscellaneous Case No of while referring that case to <ORG> This personal liberty consists in th
